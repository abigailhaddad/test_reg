  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 232-3.5 - Operation and maintenance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Dry\ncleaning equipment must be maintained and operated to minimize the release of\nsolvent to the environment. (b) All\ncomponents of each dry cleaning system must be operated and maintained in\naccordance with the requirements of this Subpart and any conditions that may be\nspecified on a facility's operating permit. For operations not specifically\naddressed, the components must be operated and maintained in accordance with\nthe manufacturer's recommendations. (c) Dry cleaning equipment must be operated, maintained and monitored to comply with the following requirements, as\napplicable: (1)\n\nWater cooled condensers must\nbe operated and maintained as specified by the manufacturer. (2)\n\nRefrigerated condensers must be\nmaintained and monitored weekly to ensure the control system operates within\nthe high and low pressure limits specified by the manufacturer. (3)\n\nThe exhaust damper of a vented machine\nmust be completely closed when the machine is not vented. If malfunctioning, the damper must be repaired or replaced within five working days of\ndetection. (4)\n\nPrior to disposal, cartridge filters and adsorptive cartridge filters must be handled using one of\nthe following methods specified in subparagraphs (i) or (ii): (i) Drained in the filter housing for no less\nthan 24 hours for cartridge filters and 48 hours for adsorptive cartridge\nfilters. If the filters are then transferred to a separate device to further\nreduce the volume of solvent, this treatment must be done in a system that\nroutes any vapor to a primary closed-loop control system, with no exhaust to\nthe atmosphere. When performing such a transfer, the filter housing must be\nclosed as soon as possible to minimize vapor leaks. (ii)\n\nDried, stripped, sparged, or otherwise\ntreated, within the sealed filter housing, to reduce the volume of solvent\ncontained in the filter. (5)\n\nAll steam and condensing coils must be\nmaintained free of lint and hard lint build-up on interior surfaces. (6)\n\nStills must not vent emissions into the\nfacility unless they operate under a vacuum (vacuum stills). Vacuum stills may\nonly be vented when a vacuum pump exhausts to maintain a continuous vacuum\nduring distillation. All stills must be operated in a manner not to exceed 75\npercent of the rated capacity or other alternate value recommended by the\nmanufacturer. Stills must be cooled to 100° F (38° C) or less before being\nemptied or cleaned. (7)\n\nButton and\nlint traps must be cleaned on the manufacturer's suggested intervals and at\nleast once each working day and the lint must be placed in a tightly sealed\ncontainer. Operations must be performed so that the opening, and subsequent\nclosing, of such traps is done as quickly as possible to minimize solvent vapor\nemissions. (8)\n\nAll parts of the dry\ncleaning system, including solvent containers, must be kept closed at all times\nexcept when access is required for proper operation and maintenance. (9)\n\nWastewater treatment units managing\nsolvent-contaminated wastewater must be operated and managed in accordance with\n\nParts 360 through 374 and Part 376 of this Title, as applicable. (i) Carbon filtration units - carbon\ncartridges must be replaced according to the schedule specified by the\nmanufacturer. (ii)\n\nEvaporators -\nevaporators treating solvent-contaminated wastewater must be operated to ensure\nthat no liquid solvent or visible emulsion is allowed to\nvaporize. (d) Preparedness and prevention. (1)\n\nAll dry\ncleaning operations must be equipped with the following: (i) adequate spill control equipment\nincluding sorbent materials, or alternative method for absorbing\nspills; (ii)\nvapor-proof containers\nfor storing spill-contaminated material; and\n(iii)\nfire control\nequipment. (2)\n\nSufficient\naisle space must be maintained to allow for proper inspection of the dry\ncleaning equipment. (3)\nA\nreasonable supply of commonly replaced spare parts for repairing dry cleaning\nequipment must be available at the dry cleaning\nfacility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
