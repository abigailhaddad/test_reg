  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 200.1 - Filing of report\n\nState Regulations\n\nPursuant to section 4410 of the New York Insurance Law, each employee welfare fund subject to the law is required to file with the superintendent an \"annual report\". This is a condensed report, containing certain pertinent information from the annual statement, designed for distribution to employee-members, contributing employers and participating labor organizations. Section 4410 reads in part as follows: \"Such annual report shall be kept on file with the superintendent and at the principal office of the trustees. The report, or such portion thereof as the superintendent deems appropriate, shall be made available by the superintendent or by the trustees, or both, for inspection by any employer contributing to such fund, by any labor organization which is a party to an agreement establishing such fund, or by any employee covered by such fund. In addition and to such extent that he deems it to be in the public interest, the superintendent may require the trustees to mail such report or such portions of it to any or all of such parties.\"\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n200.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
