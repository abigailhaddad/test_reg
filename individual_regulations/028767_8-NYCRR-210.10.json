  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 210.10 - Hardship cases\n\nState Regulations\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions contained herein, the\ncommissioner is authorized in hardship cases to make advance payments in\nanticipation of the eligible person actually completing his moving of personal\nproperty or actually purchasing or renting and occupying decent, safe and\nsanitary replacement housing. The commissioner may authorize the advance\npayment of the amount determined by him to represent reasonable and necessary\nmoving expenses or the amount of the approved supplemental relocation payment\ndeemed necessary to purchase or rent, decent, safe and sanitary replacement\nhousing. In the case of a supplemental relocation payment, payment can only be\nmade if there is a signed contract for the purchase of a replacement property, or in the case of a replacement rental unit, if there is a signed lease or some\nother firm commitment. In both instances, the proposed replacement housing must\nbe inspected prior to payment for a determination of compliance with decent, safe and sanitary standards. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§\n210.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
