  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 251.3 - Emission limits\n\nState Regulations\n\nFacilities subject to this Part must comply with the\napplicable carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) emission limit\nestablished in this Section. The emission limits in subdivision (a) of this\nsection are measured on a 12-month rolling average basis, calculated by\ndividing the annual total of CO\n2\nemissions over the\nrelevant 12-month period by either the annual total (gross) MW generated\n(output-based limit) or the annual Btu input (input-based limit) over the same\n12-month period. The emission limits in subdivision (b) of this section are\nmeasured on an annual basis, calculated by dividing the annual total of CO\nemissions for the calendar year by either the annual total (gross) MW generated\n(output-based limit) or the annual Btu input (input-based limit) over the same\ncalendar year for each fuel combusted. (a) 'New Sources and Modified Existing\n\nSources'\n(1)\n\nOwners or operators of a source\nof one of the following types, except for those emission sources directly\nattached to a gasifier, are required to meet an emission rate of 925 pounds of\nCO\n2\nper MW hour gross electrical output (output-based\nlimit) or 120 pounds of CO\n2\nper million Btu of input\n(input-based limit): (i) boilers that are\npermitted to fire greater than 70 percent fossil fuel; (ii)\ncombined cycle combustion turbines; or\n(iii)\nstationary internal\ncombustion engines that fire only gaseous fuel. (2)\n\nOwners or operators of a source of one of\nthe following types, except for those emission sources directly attached to a\ngasifier, are required to meet an emission rate of 1450 pounds of\nCO\n2\nper MW hour gross electrical output (output-based\nlimit) or 160 pounds of CO\n2\nper million Btu of input\n(input-based limit): (i) simple cycle\ncombustion turbines; or\n(ii)\nstationary internal combustion engines that fire either liquid fuel or liquid\nand gaseous fuel simultaneously. (3)\n\nOwners or operators of any other emission\nsource that is not subject to a specific CO\n2\nemission\nlimit in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision are required to propose and\nmeet a case-specific emission limit for CO\n2. This\nproposal must be based on an analysis of existing control technologies and\noperating efficiencies of existing sources, and other appropriate\nconsiderations relevant to the source's CO\n2\nemission\nprofile. The proposed emission limit must achieve the maximum degree of\nCO\n2\nemission reduction for new sources, and shall not be\nless stringent than the CO\n2\nemission control or\noperating efficiency that is achieved in practice by the best controlled\nsimilar source(s). The proposal must be submitted to the department for review\nand approval. In no case will the department approve a proposal in which\ngreater than 50 percent of the heat input is derived from solid fossil fuel or\noil, unless the CO\n2\nemission rate associated with that\ninput meets the CO\n2\nemission limit in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision. For purposes of this paragraph, emission sources that are\ndirectly attached to a gasifier must include the CO\n2\nemissions from the gasifier in the case-specific CO\n2\nemission limit. (b) 'Non-Modified Existing Sources'. Beginning on December 31, 2020, owners or\noperators of a non-modified existing source are required to meet an emission\nrate of 1800 pounds of CO\n2\nper MW hour gross electrical\noutput (output-based limit) or 180 pounds of CO\n2\nper\nmillion Btu of input (input-based limit) for each fossil fuel combusted. As of\n\nDecember 31, 2020, owners or operators of a non-modified existing source shall\nnot fire any single fossil fuel, alone or in combination with any other fuel, with an emission rate that is greater than or equal to 1,800 pounds of\nCO\n2\nper MW hour gross electrical output or 180 pounds of\nCO\n2\nper million Btu of input.
