  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 400.13 - Forms (Hospital/Community Patient Review Instrument)\n\nState Regulations\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nImage\nNEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH\nDIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING\nINSTRUCTIONS: HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY\nPATIENT\nREVIEW INSTRUMENT (H/C-PRI)\nGENERAL CONCEPTS\n1. PURPOSE: Preadmission review\nto a Residential Health Care Facility (RHCF) from the hospital and community\nbased residences and facilities, such as personal dwelling, domicillary care\nfacility/adult home and congregate housing. 2. ASSESSORS: As qualified\nthrough the N.Y.S. Department of Health PRI Training Program - hospital\ndischarge planners, certified home health care agency registered nurses, RHCF\nregistered nurses, county public health nurses and other utilization review\npersonnel as designated. 3. USING THESE INSTRUCTIONS: These instructions should be read before\ncompleting the H/C-PRI and should be kept with the H/C-PRIs as they are being\ncompleted. FREQUENT REFERENCE TO THE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE NEEDED TO\nCOMPLETE THE H/C-PRI ACCURATELY. 4. ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS\nAnswer\nall questions using the numeric codes provided. DO NOT LEAVE ANY\nQUESTIONS TOTALLY BLANK. UNUSED BOXES FOR A QUESTION SHOULD REMAIN\nBLANK. For example, Medical Record Number: //\n9\n/\n6\n/\n2\n/\n1\n/\n0\n/. If there are unused boxes, they should be on the left\nside of the number as shown in the example. 5. QUALIFIERS: Many of the PRI\nquestions contain multiple criteria which are labeled qualifiers. All\nqualifiers must be met for a question to be answered \"yes\". These qualifiers\ntake the following forms: *\nTIME PERIOD\n- The time period for the\nquestions is the past week. For the patients who have been in the hospital less\nthan one week use the time from admission to H/C-PRI completion as the\ntimeframe. If the community assessor (e.g., certified home health care agency, RHCF assessor) does not have any history on the patient, then the day of the\nH/C-PRI assessment is the timeframe. See \"Sources of Information\" below. *\nFREQUENCY\n- The frequency specifies how\noften something needs to occur to meet the qualifier. For example, suctioning\nneeds to occur daily for at least one week or the PRI cannot be checked for\nthis patient as receiving this care. *\nDOCUMENTATION\n- Some of the questions\nrequire specific medical record documentation to be present. Otherwise, the\nquestion cannot be answered \"yes\" for the patient. *\nEXCLUSIONS\n- Some of the questions\nspecifically state to omit certain types of care or behavior when answering the\nquestion. For example, inhalators are excluded from oxygen therapy. 6. SOURCES OF\nINFORMATION: For community based referred patients, the sources of\ninformation may not be as accessible as in the hospital. Discussion with the\npatient's family members, other caregivers and personal physician(s) will help\nprovide more accurate information. The patient may be recieving community\nservices or may have in the past. 7. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING\n(ADLs): The approach to measuring ADLs is slightly different from other\nPRI questions. Measure how capable the patient is in completing each ADL 60% or\nmore of the time it needs to be performed. CAPABILITY\n- Reviewing\nthe patient's physical and mental status, measure the present capability of the\npatient to perform each ADL. This is in contrast to how the patient may be\nactually performing the ADLs in the hospital/facility or in the community. Read\nthe specific instructions on ADLs to understand the\nCHANGED CONDITION\nRULE, the specific ADL definitions and the measurement of\ncapability. 8. CORRECTIONS: Cross out any responses which you wish to change and\nreenter clearly to the right of the original response. Example: /3/4\nINSTRUCTIONS: H/C-PRI QUESTIONS\nI. ADMINISTRATIVE DATA\n1. OPERATING CERTIFICATE NUMBER: Enter the seven or eight character identifier stated on the facility's/agency's\noperating certificate. For a hospital there will always be seven (7) numbers\nfollowed by an \"H\" in the eighth box. For a certified home health agency and a\ncounty Department of Health, there will only be seven (7) numbers with no\nletters. This means the first answer box to the left will remain blank. For a\nresidential health care facility, there will be seven (7) numbers followed by\nan \"N\" which indicates a nursing facility. 2. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER: Do\nnot leave blank; enter zero in far right hand box if patient does not have a\nnumber. 3. OFFICIAL FACILITY\nNAME: Print the formal name of the hospital/community agency, etc. 4. PATIENT NAME: When completing the H/C-PRI do not use nicknames. Print last name first (e.g., Brant, Diana C). 6. MEDICAL\nRECORD NUMBER/CASE NUMBER: Enter the unique number assigned by the\nhospital/agency to identify each patient. It is not the Medicaid, Medicare or\n\nSocial Security number, unless that is the number used to identify patients. If\nthere is no assigned case number for the community based patient, leave this\nquestion blank. 7. HOSPITAL\nROOM NUMBER: Enter the numbers and/or letters which identify the\npatient's room in the hospital or other applicable community facility. If the\npatient is residing in the community when the H/C-PRI review is completed, then\nprint the address in question 4., \"Patient Name.\" (Community is defined as a\npersonal dwelling, Adult Home, congregate housing, or other domicillary type\nfacilities/dwellings.)\n8. NAME OF HOSPITAL UNIT/BUILDING/DIVISION: Print the name of the\nhospital unit, such as \"med-surgery,\" where the patient was reviewed. Include\nany other unique hospital location identifiers, such as specific building names\nwhere the unit is located. However, if the patient has changed units or\nbuildings or will be moving, then print instead where the patient can be\nlocated in the future (if known). If the patient is reviewed in the community, then this question is not applicable and can be left blank. 11A. DATE OF HOSPITAL ADMISSION OR\nINITIAL AGENCY VISIT: Enter in numerical format the month, day and year\nthe patient was admitted to this hospital for the purposes of this review. (Use\nmost recent hospitalization date for multiple hospitalizations.) Do not include\nthe date of Alternate Level of Care status (ALC), rather enter this date, if\napplicable, in Question 11B. If the patient is being reviewed in the community, enter the date of the initial patient visit by the certified home health care\nagency, nursing home or any other qualified agency/organization. This visit may\nbe a followup to a referral made by the patient, the patient's family, the\npatient's physician, etc. 11B. DATE OF ALTERNATE LEVEL OF CARE STATUS: Enter in numerical format\nthe day, month and year the patient went onto Alternate Level of Care status\n(ALC) in the hospital. If the patient has entered ALC status more than once\nduring this hospital stay, enter the most recent ALC admission date. (That is, this patient was on ALC status, but was discharged because of an acute episode\nand then went back to ALC status.) If the patient is not on ALC status or is in\nthe community during this review, enter a zero (0) in far right hand\nbox. 12. MEDICAID\nNUMBER: Enter these numbers if patient has such coverage. 13. MEDICARE NUMBER: available, whether or not the coverage is being used. If not, enter only one zero in the\nfar right hand box. 14. PRIMARY PAYOR: Enter the one source of coverage which pays for\nmost of the patient's current hospitalized stay; for patients in the community\nenter what is covering the patient's community health care needs. Code \"other\"\nonly if the primary payor is not Medicaid or Medicare. \"Other\" includes\nself-pay and private insurance. 15. REASON FOR PRI COMPLETION: Select the one reason why the PRI is\nbeing completed. This is for preadmission review purposes. # 1 RHCF Application from Hospital means the patient\nresides in the hospital at the time of this H/C-PRI review and is applying for\nadmission into a residential health care facility (RHCF, HRF or SNF). This\nH/C-PRI is being completed by a qualified hospital assessor or another\nqualified assessor (i.e., RHCF assessor, certified home health care agency\nassessor) who enters the hospital to review the patient. # 2 RHCF Application for Community means the patient\nresides in the community during this H/C-PRI review. Include Adult Homes and\nother domicillary care facilities. II. MEDICAL EVENTS\n16. DECUBITUS LEVEL: Enter the\nlevel of skin breakdown (located at pressure points) using the qualifiers\nstated below: Documentation\n\nFor a patient to be coded as\nlevel 4, documentation by a licensed clinician must exist which describes the\nfollowing three components: * A description of the patient's decubitus. *\nCircumstances or medical condition which led to the decubitus. * An active\ntreatment plan. Definition\nLEVELS: #0 No reddened skin or breakdown. #1 Reddened skin, potential breakdown. #2 Blushed skin, dusty colored, superficial layer of\nbroken or blistered skin. #3 Subcutaneous skin is broken down. #4 Necrotic breakdown of skin and subcutaneous tissue\nwhich may involve muscle, fascia and bone. #5 Patient is at level 4, but the documentation qualifier\nhas not been met. 17. MEDICAL CONDITIONS: For a YES to be answered for any of these\nconditions, all of the following qualifiers must be met: Time Period\n\nCondition must have existed\nduring the past week. Documentation\n\nWritten support exists that\nthe patient has the condition. Definitions\n\nSee chart below. (Examples are\nfor clarification and are not intended to be all-inclusive.)\nDEFINITION\nEXAMPLES OF CAUSES\nEXAMPLES OF TREATMENTS\n17A.

Carcinoma, Renal disease, and Cardiac diseases\n\nSocial/ emotional support\n17F. CONTRACTURES: Shortening and\ntightening of ligaments and muscles resulting in loss of joint movement. Determine whether range of motion loss is actually due to contractures and not\nonly due to spasticity or paralysis or in joint pain. Comatose, Bedbound High dependence with ADLs Low\nphysical tolerance for exercise. Exclude range of motion loss due to spasticity\nor paralysis only. Range of Motion Ambulation Splint care PT/OT\nregimen\n\nIt is important to observe the patient to confirm\nwhether a contracture exists and check the chart for confirmatory\ndocumentation. To qualify as \"YES\" on the H/C PRI the following qualifiers must\nbe met: 1. The contracture must be documented by a physician, physical therapist or occupational therapist. 2. The status of the contracture must be reevaluated\nand documented by the physician, physical therapist or occupational therapist\non an annual basis. There does not need to be an active treatment plan to\nenter \"YES\" to contractures. 17G. DIABETES MELLITUS: A metabolic\ndisorder in which the ability to oxidize carbohydrates is compromised due to\ninadequate pancreatic activity resulting in disturbance of normal insulin\nproduction. This may or may not be the primary problem (Q.29) or primary\ndiagnosis. It should be diagnosed by a physician. Include any degree of\ndiabetes, stable or unstable, and any manner it is controlled. Destruction/ malfunction of the pancreas Exclude\nhypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which may be a diabetic condition, but by itself\ndoes not constitute diabetes mellitus. Special diet Oral agents Insulin Exercise\n17H. URINARY TRACT INFECTION: During the\npast week, signs and symptoms of a UTI have been exhibited or it has been\ndiagnosed by lab tests. Exclude if symptoms are present, but the lab values\nare negative\n\nAntibiotics Fluids\n\nSymptoms may include frequent voiding, foul smelling\nurine, voiding small amounts, cloudy urine, sediment and an elevated\ntemperature.

Exclude any self-care patients who do not\nneed daily staff help. Daily for the past week (7 days) or will continue to\nbe required for 7 days. Self-care patients\n18B. SUCTIONING: Nasal or oral\ntechniques for clearing away fluid or secretions. May be for a respiratory\nproblem. Daily for the past week (7 days) or will continue to\nbe required for 7 days. Any tracheostomy Suctioning\n18C. RESPIRATORY CARE: Care for any\nportion of the respiratory tract, especially the lungs (for example COPD, pneumonia.) This care may include one or more of the following: percussion or\ncupping, postural drainage, positive pressure machine, possibly oxygen to\nadminister drugs, etc. Daily for the past week (7 days) or will continue to\nbe required for 7 days. Suctioning\n18D. OXYGEN THERAPY: Administration of\noxygen by nasal catheter, mask (nasal or oronasal), funnel/cone, or oxygen tent\nfor conditions resulting from oxygen deficiency (\ne.g., cardiopulmonary condition). Daily for the past week (7 days) or will continue to\nbe required for 7 days. Inhalators Oxygen in room, but not in use\n18E. NASAL GASTRIC FEEDING: Primary food\nintake is by a tube inserted into nasal passage; resorted to when it is the\nonly route to the stomach. None\n\nNone Gastrostomy not applicable\n18F. PARENTERAL FEEDING: Intravenous or\nsubcutaneous route for the administration of fluids used to maintain fluid, nutritional intake, electrolyte balance (for example, comatose, damaged\nstomach). None\n\nNone Gastrostomy not applicable\n18G. WOUND CARE: Subcutaneous lesion(s)\nresulting from surgery, trauma, or open cancerous ulcers. Care has been provided or is professionally judged to\nbe needed for at least 3 consecutive weeks\n\nDecubiti Stasis ulcers Skin tears Feeding tubes\n18H. CHEMOTHERAPY: Treatment of\ncarcinoma through IV and/or oral chemical agents, as ordered by a physician. (Community-based patient may have to go to a hospital for treatment.)\n\nNone\n\nNone\n18I. TRANSFUSIONS: Introduction of whole\nblood or blood components directly into the bloodstream. (Community-based\npatient may have to go to a hospital for treatment.)\n\nNone\n\nNone\n18J. DIALYSIS: The process of separating\ncomponents, as in kidney dialysis (\ne.g., renal failures, leukemia, blood dyscrasia). (Community-based patient may have to go to a\nhospital for treatment.)\n\nNone\n\nNone\n18K. BOWEL AND/OR BLADDER\nREHABILITATION: The goal of this treatment is to gain or regain optimal\nbowel and/or bladder function and to reestablish a pattern. It is much more\nthan just a toileting schedule or a maintenance/ conditioning program. Rather\nit is an intense treatment which to very specific and unique for each patient\nand is of short term duration\n(i.e., usually not longer than\nsix weeks). NOT all patients at level 5 under Toileting Q.22 may be a \"YES\"\nwith this question. The specific definition for bladder rehabilitation differs\nfrom bowel rehabilitation; refer below: Very specific and unique for each patient\n\nMaintenance toileting schedule Restorative toileting\nprogram but does not meet the treatment requirements specified in the\ndefinitions\n\nBladder rehabilitation: Will generally include these\nstep-by-step procedures which are closely monitored, evaluated and documented: (1) mental and physical assessment of the patient to determine training\ncapacity; (2) a 24-hour flow sheet or chart documenting voiding progress; (3)\npossibly increased fluid intake during the daytime; (4) careful attention to\nskin care; (5) prevention of constipation; (6) in the beginning may be toileted\n8 to 12 times per day with decreased frequency with progress. Bowel rehabilitation: A program to prevent chronic\nconstipation/impaction. The plan will generally include: (1) assessment of past\nbowel movements, relevant medical problems, medication use; (2) a dietary\nregimen of increased fluids and bulk (\ne.g., bran, fruits); (3)\nregular toileting for purposes of bowel evacuation; (4) use of glycerine\nsuppositories or laxatives; (5) documentation on a worksheet or Kardex. Exclude a bowel maintenance program which controls\nbowel incontinence by development of a routine bowel schedule. 18L. CATHETER: During the past week, an\nindwelling or external catheter has been needed. Indwelling catheter has been\nused for any duration during the past week. The external catheter was used on a\ncontinuous basis (with proper removal and replacement during this period) for\none or more days during the past week; a physician order is required. Exclude catheters used to empty the bladder once, secure a specimen or instill medication\n18M. PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS: A device was\nused during the daytime during the past week to limit, restrict or keep under\ncontrol patient movement. To qualify as a \"YES\" on the PRI, the restraints must\nhave been given for at least two continuous hours and provided during the\ndaytime. There must be a physician order for the daytime restraints restraints. Daytime includes all the time from when the patient wakes up in the morning to\nwhen the patient goes to sleep at night. Include belts, cuffs, mitts, geriatric\nchairs, harnesses, locked doors/gates, nets, bedrails and domes as restraints. (Include bedrails only for hospitalized patients, if there is a physician's\norder.)\n\nTwo continuous hours anytime during the past week (7\ndays)\n\nExclude chemical restraints Application only at night\n\nApplication for less than two continuous hours Use only for transportation\n\nDevices which the patient can manipulate and loosen/remove, such as velcro\nseatbelts\nIII. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING: EATING, MOBILITY, TRANSFER, TOILETING\nUse the following qualifiers in answering each ADL\nquestion: Time Period\n- Past week (7 days). Frequency\n- Assess the capability level of the patient to\nperform each ADL 60% or more of time performed since the ADL status may\nfluctuate during a 24-hour period. CHANGED CONDITION RULE: When a\npatient's ADL has improved or deteriorated during the past week (7 days) and\nthis course is unlikely to change, measure the ADL according to its present\nstatus. MEASUREMENT APPROACH: Measure the present\ncapability of the patient to complete each ADL. This may be in contrast to what\nthe patient may actually be doing. The reason why you are assessing capacity, rather than actual performance, is so that only patient characteristics are\ntaken into account when measuring ADLs. Omit nonpatient considerations when\nassessing ADLs. For example, physical barriers, such as stairs or no ramps, may\nprevent the patient from performing ADLs at the level s/he is actually capable. Or a facility safety policy or clinical order, such as bedrest, may prevent the\npatient from performing ADLs. Or informal supports in the community or hospital\nstaff may be providing more assistance with ADLs (\ne.g., toileting) that the patient actually needs. Definitions -\n* SUPERVISION means verbal encouragement and observation, not physical hands-on care. * ASSISTANCE means physical hands-on care. * INTERMITTENT means that a staff person does not have to\nbe present during the entire activity, nor does the help have to be on a\none-to-one basis. * CONSTANT means one-to-one care that requires a staff\nperson to be present during the entire activity. If the staff person is not\npresent, the patient will not complete the activity. Note how these terms are used together in the ADLs. For\nexample, there is intermittent supervision and intermittent assistance. CLARIFICATION OF ADL RESPONSES\n19. EATING: #3 \"Requires continual help...\" means that the patient\nrequires a staff person's continual presence and help for reasons such as: patient tends to choke, has a swallowing problem, is learning to feed self, or\nis quite confused and forgets to eat. #5 \"Tube or parenteral feeding...\" means that all food\nand drink is given by nursing staff through the means specified. 20. MOBILITY: #3 \"Walks with constant supervision and/or assistance...\" may be required if the patient cannot maintain balance, has a history of\nfalls, has stress fracture potential, or is relearning to ambulate. 21. TRANSFER: Exclude\ntransfers to bath or toilet. #4 \"Requires two people...\" may be required for reasons\nsuch as: the patient is obese, has contractures, has fractures (or stress\nfracture potential), has attached equipment that makes transfer difficult (for\nexample, tubes). There must be logical medical reasons why the patient needs\nthe help of two people to transfer. This reason should be documented in the\nmedical record. #5 \"Bedfast...\" may refer to a patient with acute\ndehydration, severe decubitus, or terminal illness. 22. TOILETING: Definition - INCONTINENT\n60% or more of the\ntime the patient loses control of his/her bladder\nor\nbowel\nfunctions, with or without equipment. #1 \"Continent... Requires no or intermittent\nsupervision\" and\n#2 \"... and/or assistance\" can refer to the continent\npatient or the incontinent patient who needs no/little help with his/her\ntoileting equipment (for example, catheter). #3 \"Continent... Requires constant supervision/total\nassistance...\" refers to a patient who may not be able to balance him/her self\nand transfer, has contractures, has a fracture, is confused or is on a\nrehabilitation program. In addition this level refers to the patient who needs\nconstant help with elimination/incontinence equipment (for example, colostomy, ileostomy). #4 \"Incontinent... Does not use a bathroom\" refers to\nthe patient who does not go to a toilet room, but instead may use a bedpan or\ncontinence pads. This patient may be bedbound or is mentally confused to the\nextent that a scheduled toileting program is not beneficial. #5 \"Incontinent... Taken to a Bathroom...\" refers to\na patient who is on a formal toileting schedule; this should be documented in\nthe medical record. This patient may be on a formal bowel and bladder\nrehabilitation program to regain or maintain control, or the toileting pattern\nis known and it is better psychologically and physically for the patient to be\ntaken to the toilet (for example, prevent decubiti). A patient may have different levels of toileting capacity\nfor bowel and bladder function. To determine the level of such a patient, note\nthat level four and five refer to incontinence of\neither\nbladder\nor bowel. Thus if a patient receives the type of care described in one of these\nlevels for either type of incontinence, enter that level. Example 1: A patient needs constant assistance with a catheter\n(level 3) and is incontinent of bowel and is taken to the bathroom every four\nhours (level 5). In this instance, enter level 5 on the PRI because they are\nreceiving the type of care described in this question for bowel\nincontinence. Example 2: The patient requires intermittent supervision for bowel\nfunction (level 2), and is taken to the toilet every two hours as part of a\nbladder rehabilitation program. Enter level 5, as the patient is receiving this\ntype of care for bladder incontinence. IV. BEHAVIORS VERBAL DISRUPTION, PHYSICAL AGGRESSION; DISRUPTIVE INFANTILE/SOCIALLY INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR AND\nHALLUCINATIONS\nThe following qualifiers must be met: Time Period\n- Past week (7 days). Frequency\n- As stated in the responses to\neach behavioral question. Documentation\n- To qualify a patient as\nLEVEL 4\nor to qualify the patient as a \"YES\" to\nHALLUCINATIONS, the following conditions must be met: *\nActive treatment plan\nfor the behavioral\nproblem must be in current use. *\nPsychiatric assessment\nby a recognized\nprofessional with psychiatric training/education must exist to support the fact\nthat the patient has a severe behavioral problem. This assessment must still be\nexhibited by the patient. Definitions\n- The terms used on the PRI\nshould be interpreted only as they are defined below: *\nPATIENT'S BEHAVIOR: Measure it as\ndisplayed with the behavior modification and treatment plan in effect during\nthe past week. *\nDISRUPTION: Through verbal outbursts\nand/or physical actions, the patient interferes with the staff and/or other\npatients. This interference causes the staff to stop or change what they are\ndoing immediately to control the situation. Without this staff assistance, the\ndisruption would persist or a problem would occur. *\nNONDISRUPTION: Verbal outbursts and/or\nphysical actions by the patient may be irritating, but do not create a need for\nimmediate action by the staff. *\nUNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR: The staff cannot\npredict when (that is, under what circumstances) the patient will exhibit the\nbehavioral problem. There is no evident pattern. *\nPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR: Based on\nobservations and experiences with the patient, the staff can discern when a\npatient will exhibit a behavioral problem and plan appropriate responses in\nadvance. The behavioral problem may occur during activities of daily living\n(for example, bathing), specific treatments (for example, contracture care, ambulation exercises), or when criticized, bumped into, etc. CLARIFICATION OF RESPONSES TO BEHAVIORAL\nQUESTIONS\n23. VERBAL\nDISRUPTION: Exclude verbal outbursts/expressions/utterances which do not\ncreate disruption as defined by the PRI. 24. PHYSICAL AGGRESSION: Note\nthat the definition states \"with intent for injury.\"\n25. DISRUPTIVE, INFANTILE OR SOCIALLY\nINAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR: Note that the definition states this behavior is\nphysical and creates disruption. EXCLUDE\nthe following behaviors: * Verbal outbursts\n* Social withdrawal\n* Hoarding\n* Paranoia\n26. HALLUCINATIONS: For a \"YES\"\nresponse, the hallucinations must occur at least once per week during the past\nweek (7 days) (in addition to meeting the other qualifiers noted above for an\nactive treatment plan and psychiatric assessment.)\nV. SPECIALIZED SERVICES\n27. PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL\nTHERAPIES: * For each therapy these three types of information will\nbe entered on the PRI: \"Level,\" \"Days\" and \"Time\" (hours and minutes). * For a patient not receiving a therapy at all, the\n\"Level\" will always be entered in the answer key as #1 (\"does not receive\"), the \"Days\" will be entered 0 (zero) and the \"Time\" will be 0 (zero). * Use the chart on the following page to understand the\nqualifiers for each of the three types of information that will be entered. Whether patient is receiving maintenance or restorative therapy will make a\ndifference in terms of the qualifiers to be used. 27. LEVEL QUESTION: QUALIFIERS\nQualifiers for Level\n\nMaintenance Therapy\n\nRestorative Therapy\n\nQualifier Not Met\n\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\nDOCUMENTATION QUALIFIERS: POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED FUNCTIONAL/ ADL ABILITY\nNo potential for increased functional ADL ability. Therapy is provided to maintain and/or retard deterioration of current\nfunctional /ADL status. Therapy plan of care and progress notes should support\nthat patient has no potential for further or any significant improvement. There IS positive potential for improved functional\nstatus within a short and predictable period of time. Therapy plan of care and\nprogress notes should support that patient has this potential/is\nimproving. Enter level 4 if any one of the qualifiers under\nqualifiers for level 2 or 3 is not met. PHYSICIAN ORDER QUALIFIER\nYes\n\nYes, monthly\nPROGRAM DESIGN AND EVALUATION QUALIFIER\nLicensed professional person with a 4-year, specialized therapy degree evaluates program on a monthly basis. Licensed professional person with a 4-year, specialized therapy degree evaluated program on a monthly basis. TIME PERIOD QUALIFIER\nTreatments have been provided during the past\nweek.

A licensed (4-year) specialized professional is\non-site supervising or providing care. (Do not include care provided by PT or\nOT aides.)\n* Qualifiers not met: Do not enter on the PRI any days\nand time of therapy which do not meet both these qualifiers under each type of\ntherapy. 28. NUMBER\nOF PHYSICIAN VISITS: Enter \"0\" (zero) unless the patient need qualifiers\nstated below are met. If, and ONLY if, the patient meets all the patient need\nqualifiers, then enter the number of physician visits that meet the physician\nvisit qualifiers. * Do not answer this question for hospitalized patients, unless an alternate level of of care status. Enter \"0\" (zero). *\nPATIENT TYPE/NEED QUALIFIERS: The patient\nhas a medical condition that (1) is unstable and changing or (2) is stable, but\nthere is high risk of instability.
