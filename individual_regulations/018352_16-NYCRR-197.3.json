Tit. 16 § 197.3 - Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Contingent assets represent a possible\nsource of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions\nregarded as uncertain. Contingent liabilities include items which may under\ncertain conditions become obligations of the utility but which are neither\ndirect nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. In the annual\nreport to the commission, contingent assets and contingent liabilities shall\nnot be included in the balance sheet but shall be shown in a supplementary\nstatement accompanying it. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n197.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
