  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 89.2 - Practice of radiologic technology\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The practice of radiography includes, but is not limited to, the following activities performed under the supervision of a licensed practitioner: (1)\nmeasuring and positioning patients; (2)\nselecting and setting up exposure factors on X-ray equipment; (3)\nmaking X-ray exposures; (4)\nusing fluoroscopy for localization purposes prior to taking a spot film of a mobile organ such as the gall bladder or the duodenal cap; (5)\noperating fluoroscopy equipment under the personal supervision of a physician, except where direct supervision is required by this part; (6)\nadministering non-intravenous contrast media pursuant to a physician's order; (7)\nperforming quality control tests; (8)\nfor individuals certified under section\n89.40\nof this Part, the intravascular administration of contrast media under the direct supervision when such administration is an integral part of an X-ray or imaging procedure; and\n(9)\nperforming manual air insufflation as a required component of an imaging procedure, such as a virtual colonoscopy procedure or a barium enema procedure, under the supervision of a physician as follows: (i) initial insertion of the tip of the balloon tube and inflating the balloon at the end of the tube under the direct supervision of a physician; and\n(ii)\ninsufflating air into the colon under the personal supervision of a physician. (b) The practice of radiation therapy includes, but is not limited to, the following activities performed under the supervision of a radiation oncologist: (1)\nsetting up the treatment position; (2)\ndelivering the required daily dose prescribed by the physician; (3)\nmaintaining an accurate record of the technical details of the treatment; (4)\nselecting the required filter and treatment distance; (5)\nmaking beam directional shells and molds; (6)\nusing diagnostic X-ray equipment only for treatment planning and not for diagnostic purposes; (7)\nassisting the medical physicist in calibration procedures; (8)\nperforming quality control tests; and\n(9)\nassisting in treatment planning procedures. (c) The practice of nuclear medicine technology includes, but is not limited to, the following activities performed under the supervision of an authorized user: (1)\nelution of a radiopharmaceutical generator; (2)\ndosage preparation; (3)\nassay of radiopharmaceutical dosages administered to patients; (4)\nuse of nuclear medicine equipment on patients; (5)\nperformance of quality control tests; (6)\nadministration of radiopharmaceuticals to patients for diagnostic purposes as ordered by an authorized user; (7)\nadministration of radiopharmaceuticals to patients for therapeutic purposes under the personal supervision of an authorized user; and\n(8)\nthe use of technology that merges radiopharmaceutical imaging technology with other forms of medical imaging technology for diagnostic purposes. All nuclear medicine technologists who use X-ray and radiopharmaceutical imaging as part of a merged imaging procedure shall: (i) be a licensed radiographer, or hold a post primary certification in computed tomography from a national accrediting organization approved by the department; and\n(ii)\noperate the merged imaging technology under the personal supervision of an authorized user until the authorized user acknowledges in writing that the nuclear medicine technologist can operate the merged technology competently without such personal supervision; and\n(iii)\nuse only single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT technology and no other X-ray imaging technology. (d) Radiologic technologists shall wear, at all times while engaged in the practice of radiologic technology, identification tags giving their name and title as \"Licensed Radiographer,\" or \"Licensed Radiation Therapist\" or \"Licensed Nuclear Medicine Technologist\" or a derivative of such a title. The tag shall not be smaller than 3/4\" x 3\" in dimension, and the lettering shall be in clear contrast to the background color of the tag. The tag shall be prominently displayed while worn. The tag shall not be worn by, or issued to a person not licensed to practice radiologic technology, or not licensed and registered in the category of practice indicated on the tag. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
