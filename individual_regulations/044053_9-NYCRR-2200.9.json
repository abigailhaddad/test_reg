  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2200.9 - Conversion after May 1, 1950\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nUpon application of the landlord, the\nadministrator shall issue an order decontrolling additional housing\naccommodations, other than rooming house accommodations, resulting from\nconversion of housing accommodations on or after May 1, 1950, if there has been\na structural change involving substantial alterations or remodeling and such\nchange has resulted in additional housing accommodations consisting of\nself-contained family units; provided, however, that such order of decontrol\nshall not apply to that portion of the original housing accommodations occupied\nby a tenant in possession at the time of the conversion, but only so long as\nsuch tenant continues in occupancy; and provided, further, that any such order\nof decontrol shall remain effective after April 30, 1962 only so long as the\nhousing accommodations are not occupied for other than single-family\noccupancy. (2)\n\nThe term\nself-contained family unit shall mean a housing accommodation with private\naccess, containing two or more rooms, consisting of at least one bedroom and a\nliving room/dining space area in addition to a kitchen (with cooking and\nrefrigeration facilities and a sink), a private bathroom (with a washbasin, toilet and bathtub or enclosed shower), and at least one closet plus an\nadditional closet for each bedroom. Such accommodation shall contain a minimum\ntotal area of 395 square feet, exclusive of the area of bathrooms and closets. In lieu of a kitchen, the accommodation may include an enclosed kitchenette or\nan area in the living room which is either recessed or semienclosed, provided\nthat all of the above-specified kitchen facilities and equipment are within\nsuch recessed or semienclosed area. Where, however, the landlord establishes\nthat either the two-room or total floor area requirement, or both, cannot be\ncomplied with because of unique or peculiar circumstances, the administrator\nmay waive this requirement if he finds that such waiver is not inconsistent\nwith the purposes of the Rent Law and these regulations and would not be likely\nto result in the circumvention or evasion thereof. (b) No order of decontrol shall be issued\nunder this section unless such conversion occurred after the entire structure, or any lessor portion thereof as may have been thus converted, was vacated by\nvoluntary surrender of possession or in the manner provided by section 5 of\nthis State Act or by Part 2204 of this Title, and unless the administrator\nshall find that the landlord has satisfied all of the requirements of the\nauthorities having jurisdiction over such conversion and over the occupancy of\nthe newly created housing accommodations. (c) No order of decontrol shall be issued by\nthe administrator where there is a conversion of occupied housing\naccommodations, unless and until the landlord obtains an order authorizing\nsubdivision or a certificate of eviction in accordance with provisions of\nsection\n2204.7\nof this Title. (d) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing\nprovisions of this section, no order shall be issued by the administrator\ndecontrolling housing accommodations: (1)\nof\nany type resulting from conversion after April 30, 1962 of rooming house\naccommodations or of single-room occupancy accommodations; (2)\nin any multiple dwelling aided by a loan\nmade by the city under article 8 of the Private Housing Finance Law, until\ncontrols are no longer required by the provisions of said article 8; or\n(3)\nin any multiple dwelling\nwith respect to which tax abatement and tax exemption beginning after April 30, 1962 is in effect under section J51-2.5 of the Administrative Code of the city, until the date on which such tax abatement or tax exemption terminates, whichever is later. (e) Any housing accommodation decontrolled under this section shall become subject\nto control if, while in such decontrolled status, it is certified, by a city\nagency having jurisdiction, to be a fire hazard or in a continued dangerous\ncondition or detrimental to life or health; and once subject to control, it\nshall continue to be subject to control, notwithstanding the subsequent removal\nof the conditions on which such certification was based.
