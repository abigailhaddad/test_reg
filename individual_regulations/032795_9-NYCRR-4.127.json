Tit. 9 § 4.127 - Executive order no. 127: establishing the not-for-profit contracting process\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the not-for-profit agency network plays a vital\nrole in delivering a variety of health, education and human services for the\n\nState; and\nWHEREAS, State agencies must act responsibly to speed the\nprocessing of contracts and avoid late payments to such not-for-profit\nagencies; and\nWHEREAS, most delays can be eliminated by better processing\npractices by the State's program and control agencies, as well as by the\nnot-for-profit agencies themselves; and\nWHEREAS, the Governor's Office of Management and\n\nProductivity, the Comptroller's Office and the Division of the Budget have\nworked on several pilot projects to improve contract processing, and have\nidentified specific additional ways to expedite the contracting process; NOW THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby direct all State departments, offices, divisions, commissions, councils, boards, bureaus, and agencies (hereinafter\ndepartment), to process contracts for the delivery of health, education, or\nhuman services by not-for-profit agencies in accordance with the terms of this\n\nExecutive Order. I. Contract\n\nProcessing Requirements. 1. Where a contract\nis to be awarded after the issuance by a State department of a request for\nproposals, and the not-for-profit agency responding to the request for\nproposals is not performing the services described in the request for proposal\npursuant to a contract with the soliciting State department, and the soliciting\n\nState department decides to contract with such not-for-profit agency, the\nsoliciting State department shall enter into a written agreement with such\nnot-for-profit agency within seven months of the date of the issuance of the\nrequest for proposals, but in any event at least 60 days prior to the date\nperformance under the contract is to begin, and forward the same to the\n\nDivision of the Budget, the Attorney General, and the Comptroller for such\napproval as may be otherwise required. 2. Where a not-for-profit agency is\nperforming services pursuant to a contract with a State department and the\n\nState department decides to enter into a subsequent contract with such\nnot-for-profit agency for the performance of the same or substantially similar\nservices, and a request for proposal is not a condition precedent to\nrecontracting with such agency, at least 60 days prior to the date performance\nunder the subsequent contract is to begin, such State department shall enter\ninto a written agreement with the not-for-profit agency and forward the same to\nthe Division of the Budget, the Attorney General, and the Comptroller for such\napproval as may be otherwise required. If no appropriation exists to support\nsuch contract, such contract shall be considered executory until any necessary\nsupporting appropriation has been made. 3. Each State department, where appropriate, may include in contracts with not-for-profit agencies for health, education, or\nhuman services a provision permitting the State department, at its option, to\nextend the terms of such contract for up to an additional three months, or to\nthe extent otherwise permitted by law. 4. To the extent otherwise permitted by law, each State department, where appropriate, may enter into simplified renewal\ncontracts (multi-year contracts) with not-for-profit agencies for the provision\nof health, education or human services. 5. The Division of the Budget shall act upon\ncontracts with not-for-profit agencies for health, education, or human services\nwithin 30 days of submission of each contract by the contracting State\ndepartment. 6. Nothing in this\n\nExecutive Order shall require submission of any contract to the Division of the\n\nBudget, the Attorney General, or the Comptroller where such submission is not\notherwise required by law, regulation, or agreement. Where a State department\nintends to submit a contract to the Division of the Budget for review and\napproval, the State department shall consult with the Division of the Budget as\nearly in the contracting process as possible. 7. Nothing in this Executive Order shall\npreclude a State department from executing a contract with a not-for-profit\nagency for the delivery of health, education, or human services where fewer\nthan 60 days remain to the date performance under the contract is to begin, where such contract cannot be executed more than 60 days prior to the date\nperformance is to begin due to the timing of the receipt of a grant or other\nfunding. 8. For the purposes of\nthis order, \"not-for-profit agency shall mean a not-for-profit corporation as\ndefined in subdivision 7 of section\n66\nof\nthe General Construction Law; a special act corporation created pursuant to\nchapter 468 of the Laws of 1899, as amended; or a corporation authorized\npursuant to an Act of Congress approved January 5, 1905 (33 Stat. 599\n), as\namended. 9.

Where a\n\nState department has developed standardized language, the department shall\nreview such language with the Division of the Budget, the Attorney General, and\nthe Comptroller. III. Requests for Proposals. 1. The Office of\n\nManagement and Productivity shall consult with, and provide assistance to, State departments, and such departments shall take steps, to simplify and\nexpedite the request for proposals process.

Within 60 days of the passage by the State Legislature of the State budget, i.e., the State Operations budget, the Aid to Localities budget, and the\n\nCapital Projects budget, each State department shall cause to be published in\nthe New York State Contract Reporter a schedule for the issuance of requests\nfor proposals for the delivery of health, education, or human services by\nnot-for-profit agencies. Issuance of the schedule shall not constitute or imply\napproval of the issuing State department's expenditure plan if such plan has\nnot been previously approved by the Division of the Budget. 3. Concurrent with the issuance of a request\nfor proposals, the soliciting department shall cause to be published in the New\n\nYork State Contract Reporter a notice of issuance of a request for proposals, and a schedule for a proposers' conference (if any), selection of successful\nproposers, and awarding of contracts. 4. Publication of requests for proposals or\nschedules for the issuance of such requests shall not subject the request for\nproposals or the schedule, or any other portion of the contracting process, to\nthe requirements of Article 4-C of the Economic Development Law. 5.
