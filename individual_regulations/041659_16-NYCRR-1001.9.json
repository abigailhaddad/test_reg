Tit. 16 § 1001.9 - Exhibit 9: alternatives\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 9 shall contain: (a) an identification and description of\nreasonable and available alternate location sites for the proposed facility, except that a private facility applicant may limit its identification and\ndescription to sites owned by, or under option to, such private facility\napplicant or its affiliates; (b) for each alternative location identified, an evaluation of the comparative\nadvantages and disadvantages of the proposed and alternative locations at a\nlevel of detail sufficient to permit a comparative assessment of the\nalternatives discussed considering: (1)\nthe\nenvironmental setting; (2)\nthe\nrecreational, cultural and other concurrent uses that the site may\nserve; (3)\nengineering feasibility, including fuel availability, wind availability (if applicable), and\ninterconnections; (4)\nreliability\nand electric system effects; (5)\nenvironmental impacts, including an assessment of climate change impacts\n(whether proposed energy use contributes to global temperature\nincrease); (6)\neconomic\nconsiderations; (7)\nenvironmental\njustice considerations; (8)\nsecurity, public safety and emergency planning considerations; (9)\npublic health considerations; (10)\nthe site's vulnerability to potential\nseismic disturbances and current and anticipated climate change impacts, such\nas sea-level rise, precipitation changes, and extreme weather events; and\n(11)\nthe objectives and\ncapabilities of the applicant; (c) a description and evaluation of\nreasonable alternatives to the proposed facility at the primary proposed\nlocation including alternatives regarding: (1)\ngeneral arrangement and design; (2)\ntechnology, including alternative power block technologies, air emissions\ncontrol systems, stack configurations (single flue vs. combined flues), cooling\ntechnologies, and alternatives to any proposed use of aqueous\nammonia; (3)\nscale or\nmagnitude; (4)\nfor wind power\nfacilities, alternative layouts of the turbines within the site location; and\n(5)\ntiming of the proposed\nin-service date for the facility in relation to other planned additions, withdrawals, or other capacity, transmission or demand reduction changes to the\nelectric system; (d) a\nstatement of the reasons why the primary proposed location is best suited, among the alternative locations required to be identified, to promote public\nhealth and welfare, including the recreational, cultural and other concurrent\nuses which the site and affected areas may serve; (e) a statement of the advantages and\ndisadvantages of the alternatives and the reasons why the primary proposed\ndesign technology, scale or magnitude, and timing are best suited, among the\nalternatives, to promote public health and welfare, including the recreational, cultural and other concurrent uses that the site may serve; (f) a description and evaluation of the no\naction/no build alternative at the primary proposed location including a\nstatement of the reasons why the proposed facility is better suited to promote\npublic health and welfare including the recreational, cultural and other\nconcurrent uses that the site may serve; (g) an identification and description of\nreasonable energy supply source alternatives including but not limited to\nalternatives to the proposed facility consisting of renewable generation, distributed generation, transmission, and demand-reducing alternatives, except\nthat an applicant may limit its identification and description to alternatives\nthat are feasible considering the objectives and capabilities of the sponsor or\nits affiliates; (h) for each source\nand demand-reducing alternative identified, an evaluation of the comparative\nadvantages and disadvantages of the proposed facility and the alternatives at a\nlevel of detail sufficient to permit a comparative assessment of the\nalternatives discussed considering: (1)\nengineering feasibility; (2)\nreliability and electric system effects; (3)\nenvironmental impacts, including an\nassessment of climate change impacts(whether proposed energy use contributes to\nglobal temperature increase); (4)\neconomic considerations; (5)\nenvironmental justice considerations; (6)\nsecurity, public safety and emergency\nplanning considerations; (7)\npublic\nhealth considerations; and\n(8)\nthe\nobjectives and capabilities of the applicant; (i) a statement of the reasons why the\nproposed facility is best suited, among the alternative sources and measures, to promote public health and welfare, including the recreational, cultural, and\nother concurrent uses that the site and affected areas may serve.
