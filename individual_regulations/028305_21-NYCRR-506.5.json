  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 506.5 - Waivers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A State agency\nmay waive a minimum energy efficiency standard set forth in section\n506.4\nof this Part for any\npurchase or for inclusion in any building designs or specifications, if it\ndetermines that the purchase for a particular building or the inclusion in any\nparticular building designs or specifications of an energy using product\nmeeting such standard: (1)\nwould be\ninconsistent with public health or safety; (2)\nwould not be in compliance with Federal, State, or local law or regulation, permit, administrative or judicial order, or\nother requirement; (3)\nwould be\nincompatible with or adversely affect the operation of other building systems\nor equipment in accordance with the purposes for which they are to be\nused; (4)\nwould cause energy losses\nor inefficiencies in other systems, equipment, or elements of the building that\nwould exceed the energy savings of using such energy using product; (5)\nwould necessitate substantial revisions\nor alterations to other existing systems, equipment, or elements of the\nbuilding, or would create an undue burden in operating and maintaining the\nbuilding; (6)\ncannot be done in a\ntimely manner because purchase of such energy using product is immediately\nnecessary on a limited and temporary basis for the protection or preservation\nof life, property, or health; (7)\nwould apply to an historic building eligible for or listed on the State or\n\nNational Register of Historic Places or be significantly inconsistent with the\nhistoric, aesthetic, cultural, or archeological character of the building; or\n(8)\nwould result in a\nsubstantial delay of the purchase of an energy using product or have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on the construction of a new building or substantial\nrenovation of an existing building because: (i) the energy using product is not widely\navailable; or\n(ii)\nthe building\nspecifications have been approved, construction or pre-installation renovation\nor other work has commenced, or substantial design has been completed prior to\nthe effective date of a standard. (b) No State agency may waive a minimum\nenergy efficiency standard set forth in section\n506.4\nof this Part, unless all\nmodels of the energy using product meeting the standard qualify for a waiver\npursuant to subdivision (a) of this section. If a minimum energy efficiency\nstandard may be waived, a State agency may purchase an energy using product\nwhich does not meet the minimum energy efficiency standard contained in section\n506.4\nof this Part. (c) No State agency may waive a minimum\nenergy efficiency standard set forth in section\n506.4\nof this Part, if the\nalternate energy using product would also qualify for the same waiver for the\nsame reason, e.g., if all models of a room air conditioner, both those meeting\nthe minimum energy efficiency standard and those that do not meet the standard, are larger in size than the units being replaced, then a State agency may not\nwaive the minimum energy efficiency standard on the basis that the standard\nwould necessitate substantial revisions or alterations to the walls of the\nbuilding. (d) A State agency shall\ndocument the procedure used for each purchase of an energy using product which\ndoes not meet the applicable minimum energy efficiency standard set forth in\nsection\n506.4\nof this Part. Such\ndocumentation may be incorporated within any other existing records that a\n\nState agency maintains, such as the procurement record as required by section\n163\nof the\n\nState Finance Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n506.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
