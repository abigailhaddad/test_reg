Such conditions include acute and chronic illnesses which may be\ncaused by the inhalation of, absorption of, ingestion of, or direct contact\nwith environmental factors. Some of these conditions may be, but are not\nlimited to, skin diseases, dust diseases of the lungs, respiratory conditions\nof the lungs due to toxic agents, poisoning (systemic effect of toxic\nmaterials), disorders due to physical agents, disorders associated with\nrepeated trauma. Conditions from which health violations could result include\nall occupational illnesses. (g) Safety violation means a violation which could result in an occupational injury\nsuch as, but not limited to, a cut, fracture, sprain, amputation, burn, electrocution or death, which results from an exposure involving a single\nincident in the work environment. All violations not classified as a health\nviolation are included in this category. (h) Serious violation means a violation for a\ncondition in a place of employment if there is a substantial probability that\ndeath or serious physical harm could result from the condition, or from one or\nmore practices, means, methods, operations, or processes which have been\nadopted or are in use in the place of employment, unless the employer did not\nknow, and could not, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, have known of\nthe presence of the violation. (i) Non-serious violation means a violation which does not fall under the\ndefinition of a serious violation. (Also referred to as other violation or\nother-than-serious violation.)\n(j) Repeat violation means a violation by an employer, where the employer had\npreviously been issued a notice of violation and order to comply for a\nsubstantially similar condition at the same site or sites under the same\nsupervision, had previously removed the violation and had allowed the violation\nto reoccur. (k) Willful violation\nmeans a violation of a safety and health standard, provision, or regulation, where evidence shows either an intentional and knowing violation of the\nstandard, provision, or regulation or plain indifference to the requirements of\nsuch standard, provision, or regulation, as further defined below. (1)\n\nAn intentional and knowing violation\noccurs when: (i) the employer was aware of\nthe requirements of the standard, provision, or regulation and was also aware\nof the existence of a condition or practice in violation of such requirement, and made little or no effort to correct the violation; or\n(ii)\nthe employer was not aware of the\nrequirements of Labor Law, section 27-a or of the regulations promulgated under\n\nLabor Law, section 27-a, but was aware of a comparable legal requirement (e.g., other state law or local law) and was also aware of a condition or practice in\nviolation of that requirement. (2)\nA violation in plain indifference to the\nrequirements of a standard, provision, or regulation occurs where: (i) the employer's higher management was\naware of a requirement applicable to their operations but made little or no\neffort to communicate the requirement to lower level supervisors and employees; or\n(ii)\nmanagement was aware of a\ncontinuing compliance problem but made little effort to avoid violations; or\n(iii)\nmanagement was not aware\nof any legal requirement but was aware that a condition or practice was\nhazardous to the safety or health of employees and made little or no effort to\ndetermine the extent of the problem or to take corrective action; or\n(iv)\nfinally, in particularly flagrant\nsituations, willfulness can be found despite a lack of knowledge of either a\nlegal requirement or of the existence of a hazard if the circumstances show\nthat the employer would have placed no importance on such knowledge even if it\nhad possessed it.
