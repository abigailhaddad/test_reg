Tit. 23 § 600.18 - Signatures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to\n\nFinancial Services Law section 809, prior to consummating a commercial\nfinancing, a provider shall obtain the recipient's signature, which may be\nfulfilled by an electronic signature, on all disclosures required to be\npresented to the recipient pursuant to the CFDL. Where the recipient is not a\nnatural person, a natural person authorized to sign on behalf of the legal\nentity may sign the disclosure, provided that the natural person is not a\nbroker. Such disclosures may be transmitted between the recipient and the\nprovider via electronic transmission and utilizing electronic signatures, regardless of whether subsequent financing agreements, amendments and\nsupplements are provided to the recipient in person, by mail or\nelectronically. (b) If a commercial\nfinancing transaction is consummated electronically, then a provider may obtain\na recipient's signature on the required disclosures electronically or by\nfacsimile. (c) A provider is not\nrequired to obtain the recipient's signature on any disclosure for a commercial\nfinancing transaction that is not consummated. When a provider provides\nmultiple disclosures to a recipient during the negotiation of a commercial\nfinancing transaction that is ultimately consummated, the provider need only\nobtain the recipient's signature on the final disclosure that corresponds to\nthe consummated transaction.
