(b) Definitions. (1)\n\nThe term water supply wherever used in this section refers to the public water supply of Water District No. 1, town of Bethlehem, Albany County, New York. (2)\n\nThe term springs refers to those springs located on the watershed and elsewhere and which are tributary to or contribute to the Water District No. 1 water supply. (3)\n\nThe term reservoirs refers to the impounding reservoir located on tributaries of Vly and Onesquethaw creeks in the town of New Scotland, in the valley between Clipp Road and Rock Hill Road on land owned by Water District No. 1, together with the two distribution reservoirs located on New Scotland Road in the town of New Scotland also located on land owned by Water District No. 1. (4)\n\nThe term watercourse means every spring, pond (other than reservoirs), stream, marsh or channel of any kind, the waters of which flow or may flow into this water supply. (5)\n\nThe linear distance of a structure or object from the reservoir or watercourse is the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (6)\n\nThe term human excreta means feces, urine and other excretions, commonly disposed of by the so-called dry system as typified by the ordinary privy. (7)\n\nThe term sewage means waste liquids containing human excreta and decomposing matter flowing in or from a house drainage system or sewer. (c) Human excreta. (1)\n\nNo human excreta shall be deposited, thrown or placed or allowed to escape into the reservoirs or any watercourse. (2)\n\nNo human excreta shall be placed or spread upon the surface of the ground at any point on the watershed of the water supply. (3)\n\nNo human excreta shall be buried in the soil on the watershed of water supply unless deposited in trenches or pits at a distance of not less than 200 feet from the reservoirs or any watercourse and covered with not less than 18 inches of soil in such a manner as to effectually prevent its being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow. (4)\n\nNo privy or receptacle of any kind for the storage or deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of the springs, streams or reservoirs, except a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant as hereinafter set forth in subdivision (d) of this section; provided, however, that the property on which the privy or receptacle is built or is to be built is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distances above-named can be obtained within the limits of such property. (5)\n\nEvery privy or receptacle of any kind for the storage or deposit of human excreta, built or to be built on property which is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distances named in paragraph (4) of this subdivision cannot be obtained, shall be placed as far as possible from any reservoir or watercourse and especially constructed of masonry, concrete or metal to form a watertight receptacle from which no outward percolation can take place.

All privies or receptacles referred to in this paragraph shall be constructed or installed only with the approval and under the supervision of the board of commissioners of Water District No. 1, and in such manner as effectually to prevent any pollution of the public water supply. (6)\n\nEvery privy or receptacle for the storage or deposit of human excreta located within the distances of 100 feet and 200 feet of the springs, streams or reservoirs shall be arranged so that all excreta will be received in a suitable watertight receptacle or removable container, which shall be emptied when filled within six inches of the top. The contents, if disposed of on the watershed, shall be buried as set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (7)\n\nWhenever, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, excremental matter from the aforesaid privy, receptacle, trench or place of disposal may be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse, the said privy, receptacle, trench or place of disposal shall be removed, after due notice to the owner thereof, to such places as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.

No sewage shall be discharged or allowed to flow into the reservoir or any watercourse nor deposited beneath the surface of the ground within 200 feet of the springs, streams or reservoirs except into watertight receptacles, the contents of which shall be disposed of as provided for by paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) of this section. If such watertight receptacles are used, they shall not be located within 100 feet; provided, however, that the property on which the receptacle is built or to be built is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distances above-named [ continued ] can be obtained within the limits of the property. In such case, the watertight receptacle shall be constructed and maintained as provided for in paragraph (5) of subdivision (c).
