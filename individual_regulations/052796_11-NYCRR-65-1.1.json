Reimbursement and Trust Agreement. To the extent that the Company pays first-party benefits, the Company is entitled to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment resulting from the exercise of any right of recovery for damages for personal injury under section 5104(b) of the New York Insurance Law. The Company shall have a lien upon any such settlement or judgment to the extent that the Company has paid first-party benefits.

Section III\nConstitutionality\n\nIf it is conclusively determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the New York Comprehensive Motor Vehicle Insurance Reparations Act, or any amendment thereto, is invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then, subject to the approval of the Superintendent of Financial Services, the Company may amend this policy and may also recompute the premium for the existing or amended policy. These amendments and recomputations will be effective retroactively to the date that such act or any amendment is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part. * * *\n(e) Mandatory personal injury protection endorsement - motorcycles.

If an eligible injured person or his legal representative institutes a proceeding to recover damages for personal injury under section 5104(b) of the New York Insurance Law, a copy of the summons and complaint or other process served in connection with such action shall be forwarded as soon as practicable to the Company or any of the Company's authorized agents by such eligible injured person or his legal representative. Proof of Claim; Medical, Work Loss, and Other Necessary Expenses. In the case of a claim for health service expenses, the eligible injured person or that person's assignee or representative shall submit written proof of claim to the Company, including full particulars of the nature and extent of the injuries and treatment received and contemplated, as soon as reasonably practicable but, in no event later than 45 days after the date services are rendered. The eligible injured person or that person's representative shall submit written proof of claim for work loss benefits and for other necessary expenses to the Company as soon as reasonably practicable but, in no event, later than 90 days after the work loss is incurred or the other necessary services are rendered.

The eligible injured person shall submit to medical examination by physicians selected by, or acceptable to, the Company, when, and as often as, the Company may reasonably require. Arbitration. In the event any person making a claim for first-party benefits and the Company do not agree regarding any matter relating to the claim, such person shall have the option of submitting such disagreement to arbitration pursuant to procedures promulgated or approved by the Superintendent of Insurance. Reimbursement and Trust Agreement. To the extent that the Company pays first-party benefits, the Company is entitled to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment resulting from the exercise of any right of recovery for damages for personal injury under section 5104(b) of the New York Insurance Law. The Company shall have a lien upon any such settlement or judgment to the extent that the Company has paid first-party benefits. An eligible injured person shall: (a) hold in trust, for the benefit of the Company, all rights of recovery which he shall have for personal injury under section 5104(b) of the New York Insurance Law; (b) do whatever is proper to secure, and shall do nothing to prejudice, such rights; and\n(c) execute, and deliver to the Company, instruments and papers as may be appropriate to secure the rights and obligations of such person and the Company established by this provision. An eligible injured person shall not compromise an action to recover damages brought under section 5104(b) of the New York Insurance Law except: (a) with the written consent of the Company; (b) with approval of the court; or\n(c) where the amount of the settlement exceeds $50,000. Other Coverage. Where more than one source of first-party benefits required by article 51 of the New York Insurance Law and article 6 or 8 of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law is available and applicable to an eligible injured person in any one accident, this Company is liable to an eligible injured person only for an amount equal to the maximum amount that the eligible injured person is entitled to recover under this coverage, divided by the number of available and applicable sources of required first-party benefits. An eligible injured person shall not recover duplicate benefits for the same elements of loss under this coverage or any other mandatory first-party automobile or no-fault automobile insurance coverage issued in compliance with the laws of another state. If the eligible injured person is entitled to benefits under any such mandatory first-party automobile or no-fault automobile insurance for the same elements of loss under this coverage, this Company shall be liable only for an amount equal to the proportion that the total amount available under this coverage bears to the sum of the amount available under this coverage and the amount available under such other mandatory insurance of the common elements of loss. However, where another state's mandatory first- party or no-fault automobile insurance law provides unlimited coverage available to an eligible injured person for an element of loss under this coverage, the obligation of this Company is to share equally for that element of loss with such other mandatory insurance until the $50,000 limit of this coverage is exhausted by the payment of that element of loss and any other elements of loss. Section II\nExcess Coverage\n\nIf medical payments coverage or any disability coverages or uninsured motorists coverage are afforded under this policy, such coverages shall be excess insurance over any mandatory or additional personal injury protection benefits paid or payable, or which would be paid or payable but for the application of a deductible under this or any other automobile no-fault insurance policy. Section III\nConstitutionality\n\nIf it is conclusively determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the New York Comprehensive Motor Vehicle Insurance Reparations Act, or any amendment thereto, is invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then, subject to the approval of the Superintendent of Insurance, the Company may amend this policy and may also recompute the premium for the existing or amended policy. These amendments and recomputations will be effective retroactively to the date that such Act or any amendment is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part. * * *\n(g) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of these endorsements, the Company shall provide at least for the payment of first-party benefits pursuant to section\n5103\nof the Insurance Law, and these endorsements shall be construed as if such coverage were embodied therein.
