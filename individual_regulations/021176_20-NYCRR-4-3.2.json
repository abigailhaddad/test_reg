  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-3.2 - General Principles\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Receipts from the sale of, rental of, license to use, or granting of remote\naccess to digital products and digital services are included in New York\nreceipts if the location where the customer derives value from the digital\nproduct or digital service, according to the hierarchy of methods set forth in\nsection 210-A and paragraphs (1) through (4) of subdivision (b) of this\nsection, is in New York State. The corporation must exercise due diligence\nunder each method described in subdivision (b) of this section before rejecting\nit and proceeding to the next method in the hierarchy, and it must base its\ndetermination on information known to the corporation or information that would\nbe known to the corporation upon reasonable inquiry. 100% of such receipts are\nincluded in everywhere receipts. (b) The hierarchy of methods referenced in\nparagraphs (1) through (4) of this subdivision used to apportion the receipt\nfrom the digital product or digital service must be applied sequentially. A\ncorporation may abandon a method only if, after exercising due diligence, it\nlacks sufficient information to apply that method. (1)\nA corporation must apportion the receipt\nto the customer's primary use location (\"primary use location method\"; see\nsections\n4-3.3\nthrough\n4-3.6\nof this Subpart). (2)\nA corporation must apportion the receipt\nto the location where the digital product or service is received by the\ncustomer (\"where received method\"; see section\n4-3.7\nof this Subpart). (3)\n\nThe corporation must apportion the\nreceipt from that digital product or service to New York State in the same way\nas receipts from that type of digital product or service were sourced in the\npreceding taxable year (\"preceding taxable year method\"; see section\n4-3.9\nof this Subpart). (4)\n\nThe corporation must apportion the\nreceipt from that digital product or service to New York State in the same way\nas its receipts from other digital products or services in the current taxable\nyear are apportioned using the primary use location method and the where\nreceived method referenced in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision\n(\"current taxable year method\"; see section\n4-3.10\nof this Subpart). (c) Corporations should refer\nfirst to the special rules for primary use location in section\n4-3.3\nof this Subpart prior to\ndetermining if a transaction qualifies as an intermediary transaction. Unless a\nspecial rule in section 4-.3.3 of this Subpart applies, a corporation then\nshould determine if the rules for intermediary transactions in section\n4-3.8\nof this Subpart apply before\napplying the other rules in this Subpart. (d) In exercising due diligence, the\nfollowing standards apply: (1)\n(i) In applying the rules under this Subpart, if the required information is not readily available to the corporation, the\ncorporation must make reasonable inquiries to a business customer to determine\nthe information required by these rules. (ii)\n\nIf the corporation has more than 250\nbusiness customers purchasing substantially similar digital products or digital\nservices as purchased by the particular customer that would be sourced under\nthis Subpart and no more than 5% of receipts from such digital products or\ndigital services are from that particular customer, then the primary use\nlocation of the digital product or digital service is presumed to be the\ncustomer's billing address (\"business address presumption\"). (2)\n\nCorporations must document the\nsteps taken before abandoning each method of the hierarchy or step within a\nmethod of the hierarchy, such as moving from a special rule for determining\nprimary use location to the general rule for determining primary use location, including documentation of reasonable inquiries made. (3)\n\nWhen the commissioner determines that the\ncorporation had access to, or could have obtained upon reasonable inquiries\nwhen required, information at the time it filed its original return to apply a\nmethod of apportionment that comes earlier in the hierarchy than the method\nutilized by the corporation, the commissioner may require the corporation to\nuse such method. (e) If\nthere is a presumption in applying a method in the hierarchy, the presumption\nmay be overcome by either the corporation or the Department. (1)\n\nThe presumption may be overcome by the\ncorporation if the corporation can prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the method it proposes to use better reflects the location where the\ncustomer derives value from the digital product or digital service. In such a\ncase, the location to which the receipts from the digital product or digital\nservice will be sourced will be based on the evidence accumulated by the\ncorporation. If the corporation believes it has overcome the presumption and\nuses an alternative method, upon audit the Department may examine the\ncorporation's alternative method to determine if the presumption has been\novercome and, if so, whether it was applied in a consistent manner for similar\ntransactions. (2)\n\nThe presumption\nmay be overcome by the Department if the Department can prove, by clear and\nconvincing evidence, that the method it proposes to use better reflects the\nlocation where the customer derives value from the digital product or digital\nservice, and that the corporation had access to, or could have obtained upon\nreasonable inquiries when required, information at the time it filed its\noriginal return that could have been used to apply the Department's\nmethod.
