  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 8-1.52 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Riding on any\nmaterial, hoist, or sliding down hoisting ropes or chains is prohibited. A\nnotice to this effect shall be posted adjacent to the hoistway on each\nfloor. (b) Hoisting ropes and\nchains shall be of sufficient strength to sustain four times the load carried; defective hoisting equipment shall be removed and shall then be so damaged that\nit cannot be again used. (c) Slings\nshall be carefully and symmetrically placed about loads, proper hitches being\nmade, so there will be no opportunity for the load to slip or tip. (d) No load, regardless of its weight, shall\nbe allowed to descend at an excessive speed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n8-1.52\n\nWherever possible, the use of chains for hoisting\npurposes shall be avoided. Wire rope slings being preferable to chain slings, it is recommended that plow steel rope of six strands, 19 wires to the strand, with hemp core be used. Manila rope when used should consist of the best\nquality long fibre hemp, and should be used only for comparatively light\nloads. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
