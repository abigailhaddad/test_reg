  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 178.1 - Liability of third parties paying or providing for wages\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 678\n(a) Personal liability in case of\ndirect payment of wages. A lender, surety or other person: (1)\nwho is not an employer and who is not a\nfiduciary, agent or other person authorized to perform acts required of\nemployers with respect to an employee or group of employees; and\n(2)\nwho pays wages directly to such employee\nor group of employees, employed by one or more employers, or to an agent on\nbehalf of such employee or employees; is liable for payment of the amount equal to the sum of\nthe New York State personal income taxes required to be deducted and withheld\nfrom those wages by the employer and interest from the due date of the New York\n\nState employer's return relating to such New York State personal income taxes\nfor the period in which the wages are paid. Example: Pursuant to a wage claim, a surety company paid an\nemployee of a construction company his net wages. This was done in accordance\nwith the surety company's payment bond covering a private construction job on\nwhich such employee was employed by the construction company. If the\nconstruction company fails to make timely payment or deposit of the New York\n\nState personal income tax required to be deducted and withheld from such\nemployee's wages, the surety company becomes personally liable for the amount\nequal to the amount of the unpaid New York State personal income taxes, plus\ninterest upon such amount from the due date of the construction company's New\n\nYork State employer's return. (b) Personal liability where funds are\nsupplied. (1)\n\nGeneral. A lender, surety or other person who is not an employer\nand who is not a fiduciary, agent or other person authorized to perform acts\nrequired of employers who: (i) advance\nfunds to or for the account of an employer for the specific purposes of paying\nwages of the employees of that employer; and\n(ii)\nat the time the funds are advanced, has\nactual notice or knowledge that such employer does not intend to, or will not\nbe able to, make timely payment or deposit of the amounts of New York State\npersonal income tax required to be deducted and withheld by such employer from\nsuch wages; is liable for payment of the amount equal to the sum of\nthe New York State personal income taxes which are required to be deducted and\nwithheld from such wages by such employer and which are not paid over to the\n\nTax Commission by the employer, and interest from the due date of the New York\n\nState employer's return relating to such New York State personal income taxes. However, the liability of such lender, surety or other person for such New York\n\nState personal income taxes shall not exceed 25 percent of the amount supplied\nby such lender, surety or other person for the payment of wages. The preceding\nsentence and the second sentence of subsection (b) of section\n678\nof the Tax Law limit the liability of a\nlender, surety or other person arising solely by reason of section\n678\nof the Tax Law, and such limitation does\nnot limit the liability which the lender, surety or other person may incur to\n\nNew York State as a third-party beneficiary of an agreement between the lender, surety or other person and the employer. The liability of a lender, surety or\nother person does not include penalties imposed on the\nemployer. (2)\n\nOrdinary working capital loan. The provisions of this subdivision and\nsubsection (b) of section\n678\nof the Tax Law do not apply in the case\nof an ordinary working capital loan made to an employer, even though the person\nsupplying the funds knows that part of the funds advanced may be used to make\nwage payments in the ordinary course of business. Generally, an ordinary\nworking capital loan is a loan which is made to enable the borrower to meet\ncurrent obligations as they arise. The person supplying the funds is not\nobligated to determine the specific use of an ordinary working capital loan or\nthe ability of the employer to pay the amounts of New York State personal\nincome tax required to be deducted and withheld. However, the provisions of the\nsubdivision and subsection (b) of section\n678\nof the Tax Law are applicable where the\nperson supplying the funds has actual notice or knowledge at the time of the\nadvance that the funds, or a portion thereof, are to be used specifically to\npay net wages, whether or not the written agreement under which the funds are\nadvanced states a different purpose. Whether or not a lender has actual notice\nor knowledge that the funds are to be used to pay net wages, or merely that the\nfunds may be so used, depends upon the facts and circumstance of each case. For\nexample, a lender, who has actual notice or knowledge that the withheld New\n\nYork State personal income taxes will not be paid, will be deemed to have\nactual notice or knowledge that the funds are to be used specifically to pay\nnet wages where substantially all of the employer's ordinary operating expenses\nmay be supplied pursuant to an agreement described as a working capital loan\nagreement. (c) Definitions. (1)\n\nOther person. As used in this section, the term\nother\nperson\nmeans any person who directly pays the wages or supplies funds\nfor the specific purpose of paying the wages of an employee or group of\nemployees of another employer. It does not include a person acting only as\nagent of the employer or as agent of the employees. (2)\n\nActual notice or knowledge. For purposes of this section and section\n678\nof the Tax Law, an organization is\ndeemed, in any transaction, to have\nactual notice or knowledge\nof any fact from the time the fact is brought to the attention of the\nindividual conducting the transaction, and in any event from the time the fact\nwould have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had\nexercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it\nmaintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the\nperson conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the\nroutines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the\norganization to communicate information unless such communication is part of\nhis regular duties or unless he has reason to know of the transaction and that\nthe transaction would be materially affected by the\ninformation. (d) Payment of New York State personal income taxes and interest. (1)\n\nProcedure for payment. A lender, surety\nor other person may satisfy the personal liability imposed upon him by section\n678\nof the Tax Law by payment of the amount\nof New York State personal income tax and interest due, accompanied by a letter\nof explanation. In the event the lender, surety or other person does not\nsatisfy the liability imposed by section\n678\nof the Tax Law, the Tax Commission may\ncollect the liability by appropriate civil proceeding commenced within six\nyears after assessment of the New York State personal income tax against the\nemployer. (2)\n\nEffect of payment. (i) General. A lender, surety or other person\npaying the amounts of New York State personal income tax required to be\ndeducted and withheld as a result of section\n678\nof the Tax Law and this section is not\nrequired to file a New York State employer's tax return with respect to those\nwages, or furnish annual New York State wage and withholding tax statements to\nthe employees. (ii)\n\nAmounts paid by\na lender, surety or other person. Any amounts paid by the lender, surety or\nother person to the Tax Commission pursuant to section\n678\nof the Tax Law and this will be credited\nagainst the liability of the employer on whose behalf those payments are made\nand also reduces the total liability imposed upon the lender, surety or other\nperson under section\n678\nof the Tax Law and this\nsection. (iii)\n\nAmounts paid by the\nemployer. Any amounts paid to the Tax Commission by an employer and applied to\nhis liability reduces the total liability imposed upon that employer. Such\npayments will also reduce the liability imposed upon a lender, surety or other\nperson under section\n678\nof the Tax Law, except that such\nliability will not be reduced by any portion of any employer's payment applied\nagainst the employer's liability which is in excess of the total liability\nimposed upon the lender, surety or other person under section\n678\nof the Tax Law. (e) New York State\nemployer's returns required by employers and statements for employees. This section does not relieve the employer of the\nresponsibilities imposed upon him to file the New York State employer's returns\nand supply the statements required under article 22 of the Tax Law and this\n\nSubchapter. (f) Time\nwhen liability arises. The liability under section\n678\nof the Tax Law and this section of a\nlender, surety or other person paying or supplying funds for the payment of\nwages is incurred on the last day prescribed for the filing of the New York\n\nState employer's return of withheld New York State personal income tax\n(determined without regard to any extension of time) in respect to such\nwages.
