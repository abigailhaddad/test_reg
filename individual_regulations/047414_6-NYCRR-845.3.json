  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 845.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters Index Number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adopted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on the watersheds of the State. The primary waters of\na drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes or ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Lake Ontario watershed in 1939 and has been closely followed in connection\nwith the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on the older maps employed by the Conservation Department at\nthe time of its 1939 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams and ponds not shown on the older maps but appearing\non the newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Lake Ontario drainage basin may be illustrated\nas follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\n0\n\nLake Ontario\n\nPrimary waters. 0-100\n\nMill Creek\n\nThe 100th tributary entering Lake Ontario numbering\nclockwise from the mouth at Tibbetts Point. 0-100-4\n\nTrib. of Mill Creek\n\nThe 4th tributary entering Mill Creek upstream from\nthe mouth. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries shall mean any stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are\nmentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond, or other body of water designated by such waters index number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after the waters index\nnumber, the specifically designated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water designated by such waters index number and\nall tributaries and subtributaries thereof which are shown on the reference\nmaps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\ngenerally known and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of\nspecifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to which\nthe unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as possible. (e) Description\nas appearing\nin table I shall mean a brief indication as to the location of the specifically\ndesignated waters. Entries may include designations of sections of waters to\nwhich a particular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may\nalso include any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates\none or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in\npart, on which the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are\nshown. (1)\n\nThe following maps were produced\nfrom original maps which may be procured through the Washington Distribution\n\nSection, Geological Survey. Map ref. no. Quadrangle name\n\nEdition\n\nPublished by\n1\n\nNinemile Point, N.Y. 1934\nU.S. Geological Survey\n2\n\nWebster, N.Y. 1934\nU.S. Geological Survey\n(g) Class\nas appearing in\ntable I and denoted by the letter B or C opposite each specifically designated\nwaters, shall mean class B or C, as the case may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra. (h) Standards\nas appearing in table I, and denoted by the letter B\nor C opposite each specifically designated waters, shall mean the standards of\nquality and purity established for class B or C, as the case may be, as set\nforth in Part 701, supra. (i) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the\nsame classes and standards of quality and purity as the specifically designated\nwaters to which they are directly tributary. (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n845.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
