  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 816.4 - Awards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Secretary\nmay make awards to applicants based on factors including, but not limited to, the amount of current and future savings produced by the applicant's action, the impact of such action upon the municipal property tax levy, the size and\ncomplexity of the action, and whether the action can be replicated by other\nmunicipalities. (b) Subject to\nannual appropriations by the legislature, awards will be made to successful\napplicants pursuant to eligibility criteria and application, review and\napproval procedures set forth herein. The maximum amount awarded per\napplication shall not exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or $25 per resident of\nthe applying municipality or municipalities as of the most recent Federal\ndecennial census, provided, however, that if the boundaries of municipalities\njointly applying for an award pursuant to this program overlap, the residents\nin overlapping areas shall be counted only once, and provided, further, that if\na county jointly applies with some but not all of the municipalities within\nsuch county, only the residents in such applying municipalities shall be\ncounted. However, where municipalities within such county have benefited from\nthe project upon which such joint application is based but are not applicants\nthemselves, the population of such counties may, in the discretion of the\n\nSecretary, be counted for the purposes of calculating the award\namount. (c) Prior to payments, recipients shall submit to the Secretary copies of studies, agreements and\nother information on the action along with verification of cost\nsavings. (d) Applicants selected to\nreceive awards will be required to meet deadlines for execution of contracts\nwith the State in order to retain the award. If an applicant does not meet such\nestablished deadlines, that applicant's award funds may be returned to the\nfunding pool for use by other eligible applicants. Applicants who lose\neligibility as a result of missing deadlines may reapply for available funds if\nany remain after the initial disbursement of awards. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
