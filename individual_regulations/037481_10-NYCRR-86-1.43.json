  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 86-1.43 - Certified home health care agency ceilings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Effective for services provided on and after April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012, Medicaid payments for certified home health care agencies (agencies), except for such services provided to children under 18 years of age, shall reflect ceiling limitations determined in accordance with this section. Ceilings for each agency shall be based on a blend of: (1)\nthe agency's 2009 average per patient Medicaid claim, weighted at 51 percent; and\n(2)\nthe 2009 statewide average per patient Medicaid claim for all agencies, as adjusted by the regional wage index factor and by each agency's patient case mix index, and weighted at 49 percent. (b) Effective for rate periods on and after April 1, 2011, the department shall determine, based on 2009 claims data, each agency's projected average per patient Medicaid claim for the period April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012, as compared to the applicable ceiling computed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section. To the extent that each agency's projected average claim is in excess of such ceiling, the department shall reduce such agency's payments for periods on and after April 1, 2011 by an amount reflecting the degree that such agency's projected average claim is in excess of such ceiling. (c) The regional wage index factor (WIF) will be computed in accordance with the following and applied to the portion of the statewide average per patient Medicaid claim attributable to labor costs: (1)\n\nAverage wages will be determined for agency service occupations for each of the 10 labor market regions as defined by the New York State Department of Labor. (2)\n\nThe average wages in each region will be assigned relative weights in proportion to the Medicaid utilization for each of the agency service categories as reported in the most recently available agency cost report submissions. (3)\n\nBased on the average wages as determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, as weighted pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision, an index will be determined for each region, based on a comparison of the weighted average regional wages to the statewide average wages. (4)\n\nThe department may adjust the regional WIFs proportionately, if necessary, to assure that the application of the WIFs is revenue-neutral on a statewide basis. (d) Agency specific case mix indexes (CMIs) will be calculated for each agency and applied to the statewide average CMI. Computation of such CMIs shall utilize the episodic payment system grouper and shall reflect: (1)\n2009 adjusted agency Medicaid claims as grouped into 60 day episodes of patient care; (2)\ndata for each agency patient as derived from the Federal Outcome Assessment Information Set (OASIS) and as reflecting the assignment of such patients to OASIS resource groups; (3)\nthe assignment of a relative weight to each OASIS resource group; (4)\nthe assignment of each agency's CMI index based on the sum of the weights for all of its grouped episodes of care divided by the number of episodes. (e) Ceiling limitations determined pursuant to this section shall be subject to retroactive adjustment and reconciliation. In determining payment adjustments based on such reconciliation, adjusted agency ceilings shall be established. Such adjusted ceilings shall be based on a blend of: (1)\nan agency's 2009 average per patient Medicaid claim adjusted by the percentage of increase or decrease in such agency's patient case mix from the 2009 calendar year to the annual period April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012, weighted at 51 percent; and\n(2)\nthe 2009 statewide average per patient Medicaid claim adjusted by a regional wage index factor and the agency's patient case mix index for the annual period April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012, weighted at 49 percent. Such adjusted agency ceiling shall be compared to actual Medicaid paid claims for the period April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012. In those instances when an agency's actual average per patient Medicaid claim is determined to exceed the agency's adjusted ceiling, the amount of such excess shall be due from each such agency to the State and may be recouped by the department in a lump sum amount or through reductions in the Medicaid payments due to the agency. In those instances where an interim payment or rate of payment adjustment was applied to an agency in accordance with subdivision (a) of this section and such agency's actual average per patient Medicaid claim is determined to be less than the agency's adjusted ceiling, the amount by which such Medicaid claims are less than the agency's adjusted ceiling shall be remitted to each such agency by the department in a lump sum amount or through an increase in the Medicaid payments due to the agency. (f) Projected payment adjustments computed pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section shall be based on Medicaid paid claims, as determined by the department, for services provided by agencies in the base year 2009. Amounts due or owed from reconciling projected payment adjustments pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section shall be based on Medicaid paid claims, as determined by the department, for services provided by agencies in 2009 and Medicaid paid claims, as determined by the department, for services provided by agencies in the reconciliation period April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012. (g) The department may require agencies to collect and submit any data deemed by the department to be required to implement the provisions of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
