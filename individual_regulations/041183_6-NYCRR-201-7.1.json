  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 201-7.1 - Emission capping in facility permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner or operator of a facility\nsubject to this Part may elect to accept federally enforceable permit\nconditions which restrict or cap emissions from the facility or an emission\nsource below one or more applicable requirements or where needed to establish\nan emission reduction credit as defined in Part 231 of this Title. (b) When an emission cap is desired, the\nfacility owner or operator must submit an application for a facility permit or\nfacility permit modification which includes the information in subdivisions (c)\nand (d) of this section. The facility owner or operator may also accept the\nconditions of a department initiated permit modification in accordance with\n\nPart 621 of this Title to establish an emission cap. (c) A facility permit or facility permit\nmodification application that proposes a cap must contain the following\nmaterial in addition to the requirements of Subparts 201-5 or 201-6 of this\n\nPart. This includes a complete description of the proposed emission cap, including all background information on the emission sources and processes\ninvolved, including, but not limited to: (1)\nemissions of individual regulated pollutants; (2)\nduration and frequency of\nemissions; (3)\nexisting or proposed\ncontrol equipment; (4)\nother\nemission sources releasing the same contaminants at the facility; (5)\ncalculations assessing the applicability\nstatus of the facility; and\n(6)\ncalculations demonstrating that the cap will obviate the requirement to obtain\na title V facility permit and or comply with an applicable\nrequirement. (d) The\nfacility owner or operator must also include a proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting strategy that will be used to demonstrate that the\nemissions limitations under the proposed cap are verifiable, and enforceable, along with the proposed permit conditions. Capping methods may include: a\nreduction in the hours of operation; reformulations relating to the cap, the\ninstallation of control equipment; and/or making other process\nchanges. (e) Permits and permit\nmodifications involving proposed emission caps under this Subpart are subject\nto the public notice and comment procedures required for new permit\napplications under Part 621 of this Title. Copies of permits including capping\nconditions shall be forwarded to the administrator, unless the administrator\napproves an alternate procedure for reviewing such permits or exempts certain\nclasses of permits from such review. (f) When approved by the department, federally-enforceable conditions will be incorporated into the permit limiting\nemissions below those requiring a title V facility permit or compliance with a\nspecific applicable requirement. (g) The owner or operator of a facility subject to this section must maintain all\nrequired records on-site f or a period of five years and make them available to\nrepresentatives of the department upon request. Department representatives must\nbe granted access to any facility regulated by this Subpart, during normal\noperating hours, for the purpose of determining compliance with this and any\nother State and Federal air pollution control requirements, regulations or\nlaw. (h) On an annual basis, beginning one year after the granting of an emissions cap, the responsible\nofficial shall provide a certification to the department that the facility has\noperated all emission sources within the limits imposed by the emission cap. This certification shall include a brief summary of the emissions subject to\nthe cap for that time period and a comparison to those threshold levels that\nwould require the submission of an application for a title V facility permit, or compliance with an applicable requirement. (i) The emission of pollutants in excess of\nthe applicability thresholds for obtaining a title V facility permit or other\napplicable requirements constitutes a violation of this Part and of the\nact.
