  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 71.1 - Licensing of agents\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 471, 472(1), 473, 475, 480(1), (4) and\n481(2)\n(a) Licensing of\nagents. (1)\n(i) The Department of Taxation and Finance, upon application, may license financially responsible cigarette dealers, importers, exporters, manufacturers and other persons, located within or\noutside of the State, as agents to buy and affix stamps to be used for paying\nthe tax imposed on the possession of cigarettes for sale pursuant to article 20\nof the Tax Law. Except as otherwise provided for in this Title, no person may\npurchase, possess or affix such stamps evidencing the payment of the cigarette\ntax unless such person has been granted and publicly displays, in the person's\nplace of business, a license as a cigarette agent. Further, unless so licensed\nor specifically provided for, no person may possess in this State more than 400\ncigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages without establishing to\nthe satisfaction of the department that such cigarettes are not subject to tax. An agent shall, at all times, have the right to appoint any person in such\nagent's lawful employ to affix stamps to any packages of cigarettes under the\nagent's control. (ii)\n\nThe license\ngranted to a cigarette agent by the department is personal to the person to\nwhom it is granted and such license is not assignable. Except as provided in\nsection\n71.8\nof this Part, a license as a cigarette agent shall continue in effect until\ncancelled or suspended by the department or until surrendered by the licensee. The relationship which exists between the department and a licensed cigarette\nagent must, at all times, be one of good faith and cooperation. As a licensee\nof the State, an agent is responsible for the honest and expeditious payment\nand collection of the cigarette tax (see Part 74 of this Title). (2)\n(i) The department may license as a cigarette\nagent, a dealer in cigarettes, either at the wholesale or retail level, to\npurchase cigarette tax stamps and to affix such stamps on packages of\ncigarettes to be sold by the dealer in New York State. Such dealer must\nmaintain a separate warehousing facility for the purpose of receiving and\ndistributing cigarettes and conducting its business, and must receive\ncommitments from at least two cigarette manufacturers whose aggregate market\nshare of the New York State cigarette market is at least 40 percent. (a) A\nseparate warehousing\nfacility\nfor the purpose of receiving and distributing cigarettes and\nconducting business shall mean a warehouse, storehouse or other commercial\nbuilding, or a group of such buildings, wherein cigarettes are received, stored\nand distributed and the dealer's day-to-day business activities are conducted. Such a warehousing facility must be separate and distinct from any other\nperson's facilities. A warehousing facility shall not include a mere enclosure\nwithin a larger facility, nor a means of transportation (\ni.e., a truck or van). (b) In addition to\nmaintaining such a separate warehousing facility, an applicant dealer must\nreceive and forward to the department as proof thereof, written commitments\nfrom two or more cigarette manufacturers, who collectively share at least 40\npercent of the New York State cigarette market, to the effect that such\nmanufacturers agree or pledge to sell cigarettes directly to the\ndealer. (ii)\n\nIn limited\ncircumstances, the department may also license as a cigarette agent, a dealer\nin cigarettes for the sole purpose of processing packages of cigarettes in this\n\nState which bear tax stamps of states other than New York and which cigarettes\nwill be sold exclusively in such other states. As the lawful possession of\nunstamped packages of cigarettes in this State is merely an adjunct to the\npurpose for which an agent is licensed, that being to purchase and affix New\n\nYork State tax stamps, an agent licensed pursuant to this subparagraph shall be\nconsidered a retail dealer or a wholesale dealer, as the case may be, for all\nother purposes. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment may license as a cigarette agent, an importer of cigarettes, an\nexporter of cigarettes, a manufacturer of cigarettes or any other person, who\nis not a dealer as defined by section\n70.2\n(h) of this Title. Accordingly, such importer, exporter, manufacturer or other\nperson so licensed may make no sales of cigarettes in New York State. Where\nsales of cigarettes are made within the State by the importer, exporter, manufacturer or other person, the importer, exporter, manufacturer or person is\na dealer in cigarettes and as such is subject to the provisions of paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe\ndepartment may license as a cigarette agent, the State or city, whenever the\n\nState or city obtains cigarettes for distribution on a nonprofit basis. The\n\nState or city shall not be subject to the bonding requirements of this\n\nPart. (5)\n\nNothing in this\nsubdivision, nor Title, shall be construed to permit or require licensing in\nany circumstance in which the State is without power to do so by reason of the\n\nUnited States Constitution or any laws enacted pursuant thereto. Furthermore, in isolated circumstances, in which the State has the power to permit or\nrequire licensing, the department may allow a person to act in the capacity of\nan agent without obtaining an agent's license for an exclusive purpose which is\nnot in the usual course of such person's business. A person who wishes to act\nin such capacity must receive the advanced written approval of the department\nor must act under order or direction of a court. (b) (1)\n\nBefore a person may be licensed as a cigarette agent, such person must submit\nto the Department of Taxation and Finance: (i) a complete application for license as a cigarette agent; (ii)\na nonrefundable $1,500 fee for filing\nsuch application in the form of a bank check, certified check (or other\nguaranteed draft acceptable to the department) or money order, made payable to\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance, unless such fee has been paid during\nthe preceding 12 months, in which case, the fee for a new license shall be\n$1,000; (iii)\nas proof of financial\nresponsibility, current financial statements certified as to reliability by a\nlicensed public accountant or a certified public accountant pursuant to an\naudit conducted by such accountant; (iv)\na detailed description of such\napplicant's business activities; and\n(v) in the case of a dealer in cigarettes who\nwishes to purchase and affix stamps: (a) letters, or other forms of written evidence, from at least two manufacturers\nwhose aggregate share of the New York State cigarette market is at least 40\npercent, indicating the approximate market share of each manufacturer and that\neach manufacturer will sell cigarettes directly to the applicant; (b) an indication of the extent of total\ncigarette purchases which will be made from each qualifying manufacturer; and\n(c) a description of the\napplicant's warehousing facility as described in subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nThe department will review the information submitted by the applicant and may\nfor cause refuse to license such applicant in accordance with section\n71.5\nof this\n\nPart. Upon approval of an application for a license as a cigarette agent, the\ndepartment will issue, for prominent public display, an individual certificate\nof license for each of an agent's places of business at which the agent will be\nauthorized to possess unstamped packages of cigarettes and to affix and cancel\ncigarette tax stamps. Each certificate shall bear the address of the\nappropriate place of business and a common agent identification number. Each\ncertificate shall also indicate whether or not the licensee qualifies as an\nagent for purposes of the cigarette marketing standards contained in article\n20-A of the Tax Law. Failure to display such certificate(s) will constitute a\nviolation of article 20 of the Tax Law. (c) (1)\n\nThe\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, in order to protect the State's cigarette\ntax revenue and to insure compliance with the cigarette marketing standards\ncontained in article 20-A of the Tax Law, may periodically review the status of\na licensed agent and may, at any time, require any such person to submit to the\ndepartment: (i) any records maintained in the\nnormal course of business, including but not limited to, any records required\nto be maintained by the department; and\n(ii)\ncurrent financial statements certified\nby a licensed public accountant or a certified public accountant pursuant to an\naudit conducted by such accountant. (2)\n\nNot more often than once every three\nyears, the department (in order to properly administer the cigarette tax\nimposed by article 20 of the Tax Law or the Cigarette Marketing Standards Act\ncontained in article 20-A of such law) may require every licensed cigarette\nagent to file a new application for a license, again comply with, or prove its\ncompliance with, all of the requirements of the Tax law and this Title in\nrelation to cigarette agent's licenses and to surrender its existing license\n(see section\n71.8\nof this Part). (d) (1)\n\nCurrent financial\nstatements\nas used in this section means certified financial\nstatements for a 12-month period of time (or fraction thereof in the case of a\nnew business) ended not more than 18 months prior to the date such statements\nare submitted to the department. Where such certified financial statements are\nfor a period ended more than six months prior to the date of submission, in\naddition to such certified financial statements, interim financial statements\n(on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis) must be submitted to the department\nfor a period of time ending within such six-month period. All financial\nstatements submitted to the department must reflect the individual activities\nof the applicant or of the agent, as the case may be. Where a certification is\napplicable to a consolidated group of entities, the financial spreadsheets upon\nwhich the certification was based, together with an analysis of all\nintercompany accounts, must also be provided. The department may require an\nunqualified opinion in support of such statements where it deems such an\nopinion necessary. (2)\n\nIf an\napplicant or an agent fails to supply current financial statements which have\nbeen independently certified by a licensed public accountant or by a certified\npublic accountant and/or fails to supply an unqualified opinion where necessary\nin support of such statements, as required by this section, the applicant will\nnot be licensed or such agent's license will be cancelled. However, on\npetition, either through the hearing process or on the motion of the\ndepartment, the requirements for a certification by a licensed public\naccountant or by a certified public accountant and for an unqualified\nsupporting opinion may be waived. If such requirements are waived, the\ndepartment may instead require alternative certification. (e) (1)\nA\nlicense as an agent granted pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law and this Part\ndoes not necessarily qualify a person as an agent for purposes of the cigarette\nmarketing standards contained in article 20-A of the Tax Law (see article 2 of\nthis Subchapter). (2)\n\nWhere an\napplicant for a license as a cigarette agent or where an agent is also a\nwholesale dealer of cigarettes, such applicant or agent must also obtain a\nlicense as a wholesale dealer pursuant to Part 72 of this Title. Both the\napplication for a license as a cigarette agent and the application for a\nlicense as a wholesale dealer of cigarettes are subject to individual\napplication filing fees. (3)\n\nWhere\nan applicant for a license as a cigarette agent or where an agent is also a\nretail dealer of cigarettes or a cigarette vending machine owner/operator, such\napplicant or agent must also comply with the registration provisions of Part 73\nof this Title. (4)\n\nExcept as\nprovided in this Title, where an applicant or agent is also a distributor, wholesale dealer or retail dealer of tobacco products, other than cigarettes, or an owner/operator of a vending machine through which such tobacco products\nare sold, a separate appointment, license and/or registration, as the case may\nbe, must be obtained (see article 3 of this Subchapter). (5)\n\nLicensing as a cigarette agent by the New\n\nYork State Department of Taxation and Finance shall not authorize a person to\npurchase and affix tax stamps of the City of New York nor joint stamps which\nevidence the payment of both the State and city taxes. Persons wishing to\npurchase and affix such stamps must be authorized agents pursuant to chapter 13\nof title 11 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. (f) (1)\n\nAn agent must immediately inform the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, in writing, of any change to the\ninformation shown on the application for a license as a cigarette agent or as\nlast reported to the department, including but not limited to, any change of\nname or any change in such agent's officers, directors or partners or such\npersons' addresses. However, any change of location of the agent, including any\nadditions or deletions of individual places of business, must be reported to\nthe department, in writing, prior to such change. (2)\n\nWhen shares of stock in a corporation\nwhich is an agent are acquired by any person, such that: (i) an agent which had four or fewer\nshareholders owning, directly or indirectly, the voting stock of such agent\nupon such acquisition has more than four shareholders so owning such stock; or\n(ii)\na person not previously\nowning, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the number of shares of\nvoting stock of the agent upon such acquisition owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of such stock, the agent must immediately file a\nnotification of such acquisition with the department. (g) (1)\nA license as a cigarette tax agent is not\nassignable. That is, such license shall not be transferred to any person. In\naddition to any other meaning, a license shall be deemed assigned, if any\nchange in partnership interest has occurred or if shares of stock of a\ncorporate agent are acquired by any person such that the person owns, directly\nor indirectly, more than 10 percent (25 percent or more in the case of an agent\nwhich has four or fewer shareholders) of the number of shares of voting stock\nof such agent. Except as provided herein, an assignment of a license is invalid\nand shall immediately result in the cancellation of such license. (2)\n\nThe assignment of a license as a\ncigarette tax agent occasioned by way of bequest or inheritance from a decedent\ndirectly to: (i) an ancestor of the\ndecedent; (ii)\nthe spouse of the\ndecedent; (iii)\na lineal descendant\nof the decedent, of the decedent's spouse, or of a parent of the decedent; or\n(iv)\nthe spouse of any lineal\ndescendant described in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, will not, of\nitself, be considered a transfer of license which will operate as grounds to\nimmediately cancel such license provided the Department of Taxation and Finance\nis promptly notified. However, such assignment by bequest or inheritance shall\ncause cancellation of the license 90 days after the death of the\ndecedent. (h) The Department of Taxation and Finance may license a fiscal agent or agent bank\nfor the purpose of selling cigarette stamps if the department deems such\nlicensing necessary for the proper administration of article 20 of the Tax\n\nLaw.
