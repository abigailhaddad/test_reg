Tit. 9 § 4022.16 - Determination of all questions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe stewards have power to determine all questions\narising in reference to racing at the meeting, subject to appeal to the\ncommission. Should no decision have been arrived at by the stewards within\nseven days of an objection being lodged, the clerk of the course shall then\nreport the case to the commission, which may, at its discretion, decide the\nmatter, and which, if it considers there has been negligence, may order any\nadditional expense arising therefrom to be defrayed out of the funds of the\nmeeting at which the case occurred. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4022.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
