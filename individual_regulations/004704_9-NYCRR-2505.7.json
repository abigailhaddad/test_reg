  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2505.7 - Subletting; assignment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Housing\naccommodations subject to these regulations may be sublet in accordance with\nthe provisions, and subject to the limitations, of section\n226-b\nof\nthe Real Property Law provided the additional provisions of this section are\ncomplied with and provided further that the prime tenant can establish that at\nall times he has maintained the housing accommodation as his primary residence\nand intends to occupy it as such at the expiration of the sublease. (b) The rental charged to the subtenant shall\nnot exceed the legal regulated rent plus a 10-percent surcharge payable to the\nprime tenant if the housing accommodation is sublet with the prime tenant's\nfurniture. Where a prime tenant violates the provisions of this subdivision, the subtenant shall be entitled to damages as provided in section\n2506.1\nof this Title. (c) The tenant may not sublet a housing\naccommodation for more than a total of two years, including the term of the\nproposed sublease, out of the four-year period preceding the termination date\nof the proposed sublease, but this provision shall not apply to any sublease\ncommencing prior to July 1, 1983. The term of a proposed sublease may, if\nlawful under this section, extend beyond the term of the prime tenant's lease, and a landlord may not refuse consent to a sublease solely because it extends\nbeyond such term. A sublease which so extends shall be subject to the prime\ntenant's right to a renewal lease. (d) The prime tenant, rather than the\nsubtenant, retains the right to (1) a renewal lease, whether or not the term of\nthe sublease extends beyond the term of the prime tenant's lease; and (2) the\nrights and status of a tenant in occupancy with respect to conversion to\ncondominium or cooperative ownership. (e) An owner may terminate the tenancy of a\ntenant who sublets or assigns contrary to the terms of this section, but no\naction or proceeding based upon the nonprimary residence of a tenant may be\ncommenced prior to the expiration date of his lease. (f) Upon the consent of an owner to an\nassignment, regardless of whether or not the lease is a renewal lease, the\nlegal regulated rent payable to the owner effective upon the date of such\nassignment may be increased by: (1)\nthe\nincrease provided for in section\n2502.7\nof this Title; and\n(2)\nwhich may be further increased by the\nvacancy allowance, if any, provided in the rent guidelines board order in\neffect at the time of the commencement date of the lease. Such increases shall remain part of the legal regulated\nrent for any subsequent renewal lease. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
