  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 572.6 - General requirements for the review of large scale projects or other projects to be undertaken in sections\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Permits may be granted for the\ndevelopment of large scale projects or other projects to be undertaken in\nsections, subject to conditions relating to improvements and services for and\ncompletion of the total project that the agency deems reasonable and\nnecessary. (b) No application for a\nlarge scale project or other project to be undertaken in sections shall be\ndeemed complete unless it contains sufficient information as to design of the\nentire project to allow the agency to assess the impact of the entire project\npursuant to section 809(9) or 809(10)(e) of the Adirondack Park Agency Act. The\nagency may request additional information as to the entire project before\ndetermining complete the permit application for initial section(s). (c) In addition to details as to final design\nof those sections of the project which the sponsor desires to develop first, an\napplication for the review of a large scale project or other project to be\nundertaken in sections shall contain the following, unless demonstrated by the\nproject sponsor not to be pertinent: (1)\n\nMaps. (i) A project site base map, at a scale\nappropriate to the project, showing ownership boundary lines, the boundary of\nthe project (if not identical with the property boundaries), owners of\ninholdings, if any, adjoining and adjacent landowners, existing facilities, buildings and structures on the site, streams (including intermittent streams), rivers, ponds, lakes and existing roads. (ii)\nA soils map, at the same scale as the\nproject site base map, delineating all soil series at an appropriate level of\ndetail. (iii)\nA slope map, at the\nsame scale as the project site base map, indicating contour elevations at\nintervals to be determined by the agency, and shaded to show slope categories\nof 0-3%, 3-8%, 8-15%, 15-25%, and 25%+. (iv)\nA critical areas map, at the same scale\nas the project site base map, indicating: (a) fragile lands such as shorelines and wetlands; (b) rare or valuable ecosystems and\ngeological formations; (c) significant wildlife habitats; (d) unique scenic or historic areas; (e) natural hazard lands such as 100-year\nfloodplains, areas frequently subject to weather disasters, and areas of\nunstable geological, ice or snow formations; and\n(f) renewable resource lands such as aquifers\nand aquifer recharge areas, mineral resource areas, significant agricultural\nlands, public watershed lands, areas presently visible from public roads or\nwaterways, and areas that will become visible upon completion of the\nproject. (v) A\ngeneralized resource capability map, at the same scale as the project site base\nmap, indicating, through the use of overlay shadings and a development\nlimitation rating system, the cumulative limitations to development due to the\nabove resource maps. This map should be done prior to any survey, engineering, site layout or design work. (vi)\nA\nproposed general development map, at the same scale as the project site base\nmap, showing generally areas of proposed development; the approximate number of\nlots and average size or other type of development in each general area; areas\nproposed to be retained as open space; the plan map land use area boundaries; the location of proposed facilities such as dams and impoundments, community\nwater systems, storm drainage systems, community sewerage systems, industrial\nwastewater discharges, and waste disposal areas; the proposed primary road\nnetwork; and all areas to be disturbed by construction activities. (2)\n\nNarrative and non-map data. A\nproject sponsor will be expected to describe the following, as well as the\nmethodology used to develop, design or ascertain the existence of each item: (i) soil, slope and critical resources data\nnot presented on the base maps; (ii)\nterrestrial and aquatic flora and\nfauna; (iii)\nsurface drainage\npatterns; (iv)\naesthetics; (v) adjoining and\nnearby land uses; (vi)\nexisting\non-site land uses; (vii)\npublic\ntransportation facilities; (viii)\npublic water and sewage systems, other public utilities, storm drainage plans; erosion and sedimentation control measures, solid waste disposal methods; alterations to shorelines, wetlands and water bodies; (ix)\nnatural materials to be used in\nconstruction; (x) proposed uses of\npesticides and herbicides; (xi)\nsources of air and noise pollution; (xii)\noutdoor recreational facilities and\nopen-space resources; (xiii)\nall\nlegal instruments, such as homeowners' association charters and agreements, proposed declarations of covenants, deeds and other documents and instruments\nof conveyance; (xiv)\neconomic and\ngovernmental service considerations, such as existing governmental\ncapabilities, burden or benefit of the project on local levels of employment, and the tax base; and\n(xv)\nplans to\ndevelop other lands in common with, in a group of, controlling, or controlled\nby others acting in concert with the sponsor or as part of a common scheme or\nplan. The agency may require the submission of reasonable\nadditional data, including information listed in section\n572.4\nof these regulations. (d) An\nagency decision relating to a section of a project shall contain findings and\nconclusions with respect to the likely impact of the entire project and its\ncompliance with section 809(9) or 809(10) of the Adirondack Park Agency\n\nAct. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n572.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
