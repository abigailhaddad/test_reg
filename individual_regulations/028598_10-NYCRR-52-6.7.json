For out-of-state skin procurements, all required clinical laboratory testing shall be performed by a laboratory which is approved by that state's regulatory authority, the United States Health Care Financing Administration, or by the department. (a) Blood samples from all allogeneic skin donors shall be tested for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and for syphilis, and, unless the tissue is to be virally inactivated, antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), for purposes of donor selection. (b) Microbial testing of skin from each anatomical site for aerobic and anaerobic contamination shall be performed using standard laboratory procedures. Whenever fresh skin is transplanted, the results of cultures shall be made available to the transplantation surgeon on a daily basis until the final reading has been completed. (c) All skin tissue from living donors intended for allogeneic use shall be quarantined for at least six months. After such time and prior to the distribution of the tissue for transplantation, the donor shall be retested for HBsAg and antibodies to HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 and tested for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc).
