  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2505.2 - Evasion\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The legal\nregulated rents and other requirements provided in this Chapter shall not be\nevaded, either directly or indirectly, in connection with the renting or\nleasing or the transfer of a lease of housing accommodations by requiring the\ntenant to pay, or obligate himself for membership or other fees, or by\nmodification of the practices relating to payment of commissions or other\ncharges, or by modification of the services furnished or required to be\nfurnished with the housing accommodations, or otherwise. (b) (1)\n\nUpon the receipt of rent in the form of cash or any instrument other than the\npersonal check of the tenant, it shall be the duty of the owner to provide the\ntenant with a written receipt containing the following: (i) the date; (ii)\nthe amount; (iii)\nthe identity of the premises and period\nfor which paid; and\n(iv)\nthe\nsignature and title of the person receiving the rent. (2)\nA tenant may request in writing that an\nowner provide a receipt for rent paid by personal check. If such request is\nmade, the owner shall provide the tenant with the receipt described in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nThe receipt provided pursuant to this\nsubdivision shall state the name and address of the managing agent or designee\nthereof. A failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision shall\nconstitute an evasionary practice. (4)\n\nSuch request shall, unless otherwise\nspecified by the tenant, remain in effect for the duration of such tenant's\ntenancy. The owner shall maintain a record of all cash receipts for rent for at\nleast three years unless a longer period is required by other provisions of\nthis Title. (5)\n\nIf a payment of\nrent is personal transmitted to an owner, the receipts for such payment shall\nbe issued immediately to a tenant. If a payment of rent is transmitted\nindirectly to an owner, a tenant shall be provided with a receipt within\nfifteen days of such rent payment. (6)\n\nIf an owner or an agent of an owner\nauthorized to receive rent fails to receive payment for rent within five days\nof the date specified in a lease agreement, such owner shall send the tenant, by certified mail, a written notice stating the failure to receive such rent\npayment. The failure of an owner or an agent of the owner authorized to receive\nrent to provide a tenant with a written notice of the non-payment of rent may\nbe used as an affirmative defense by such tenant in an eviction proceeding\nbased on the non-payment of rent.
