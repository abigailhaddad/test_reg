  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-11.2 - Construction materials\n\nState Regulations\n\nSpecifications are given in Section II of the ASME\nBoiler and Pressure Vessel Code for the important materials used in the\nconstruction of boilers, and the materials for miniature boilers, for which\nspecifications exist, shall conform thereto, except that steel pipe for sizes\nover three inches in diameter shall be of open hearth steel. Owing to the small\nsize of the parts of miniature boilers, stamping as required by Section II of\nthe ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code need not be visible after completing\nthe boiler, provided the manufacturer certifies on the data report accompanying\nthe boiler that the material is in accordance with the requirements of the New\n\nYork State Miniature Boiler Code. Provisions shall be made by the manufacturer\nwhereby it shall be able to supply complete information regarding the material\nand details of construction of any boiler built under the rules of this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-11.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
