(1)\nA surrender of\nregistration shall consist of the delivery or mailing to the department of the\nregistration and both plates (unless only one plate has been issued). Note: The surrender requirement shall not apply to vehicles\nregistered in the Daily Rental (OMS) and Daily Rental Vanity (OMV) registration\nclasses. (2)\n\nThe\ndepartment recognizes that in certain cases surrender of the registration and\nplates may not be possible. In the event that the registrant is unable to\nsurrender the registration and license plate(s) because they were stolen or\nlost, the registrant may report such theft or loss to a local law enforcement\nagency and obtain either a Report of Lost or Stolen Motor Vehicle Items\n(MV-78B) or a letter from a police agency setting forth the pertinent details\nof the theft/loss to submit to DMV. In such case, the date of the report to the\nlaw enforcement agency shall be treated as the date of surrender, except for a\nmember of the armed forces summoned to emergency military service where the\ndate of surrender shall be the date of his or her emergency entry into military\nservice provided that he or she submits a notarized statement that the vehicle\nwas not operated on the public highways while insurance coverage was not in\neffect. In addition or in lieu of the MV-78B or letter from a police agency, DMV may, in its discretion, accept an attestation by the registrant (MV-1443.1)\nor other proof of theft or loss. In the event that the registration and/or\nlicense plate(s) were turned in to, or confiscated by another state, a letter\nfrom such state's motor vehicle department or law enforcement agency setting\nforth the date the registration/plates were turned in or confiscated may be\nsubmitted to DMV and the date specified in such letter shall be treated as the\ndate of surrender. (b) Place of surrender. A surrender of registration and license plates(s) can be\nmade at any issuing office or the central office of the\ndepartment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
