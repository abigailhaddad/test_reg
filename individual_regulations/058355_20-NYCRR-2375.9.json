  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2375.9 - Publications, notices, and online tax information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The Division of Taxation issues\na variety of publications and notices, usually designated as such, that address\nrights and responsibilities under the Tax Law, related statutes and regulations\nadopted pursuant thereto. For the most part, publications are detailed booklets\nor pamphlets that are directed at specific matters or industries. The\ndivision's publications commonly contain comprehensive narratives, examples, questions and answers, charts, sample forms and instructions, technical details\nsuch as magnetic media specifications, or related communications. Notices, on\nthe other hand, are concise, topical announcements that are issue specific. In\naddition, the division provides online tax information on the department's\nwebsite. The publications, notices, and online tax information are\ninformational in character and are primarily intended to enhance compliance\nthrough education. (b) Dissemination and modification. Publications, notices, and online tax\ninformation are the most efficient methods the division has of timely\ndisseminating written information to similarly situated taxpayers. They are\nprovided to targeted groups and also made available to division personnel and\nto anyone else upon their request and are available on the department's\nwebsite. Publications and online tax information are regularly updated, whereas\nnotices are seldom modified because of their impermanence. (c) Force and effect. The division's\npublications, notices, and online tax information in themselves do not have any\nlegal effect. This notwithstanding, publications, notices, and online tax\ninformation serve an essential role in expeditiously conveying pertinent\ninformation to taxpayers, tax practitioners, personnel of the division and\nmembers of the general public. As is the case with technical memoranda\ndescribed in section\n2375.6\nof this Part, to the extent that the division's publications, notices, and\nonline tax information are reasonable and consistent with the governing laws\nand regulations, they cannot be ignored without risking the violation of such\nlaws and regulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2375.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
