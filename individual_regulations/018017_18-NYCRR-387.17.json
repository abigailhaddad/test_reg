  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 387.17 - Certification/authorization\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Households\neligible for receipt of food stamp benefits shall be authorized to receive\nthose benefits by means of a State-prescribed form(s). Such authorization shall\nbe effective for a specific period of time, known as the certification period, which coincides with the periods of eligibility determinations and\nredeterminations. Such an authorization shall contain all pertinent information\nas to the status of the household and the amount of food stamp benefits. When\nthe certification period ends, food stamp entitlement expires and cannot\ncontinue without a recertification application and eligibility determination. Certification periods shall be as follows: (1)\n\nFor public assistance (PA) cases, except\nthose required to report quarterly, the food stamp certification period will be\nthe same as the PA certification period plus one month, but not more than a\ntotal of 12 months. (2)\n\nAt least\nfor three months, except: (i) for those\nhouseholds which at the time of initial certification had their certification\nprocess completed after the 15th day of the month of application and also had\ncircumstances which warranted it, the certification period shall be increased\nby one month; (ii)\nwhen the\nhousehold cannot reasonably predict what its circumstances will be in the near\nfuture, or when there is a substantial likelihood of frequent and significant\nchanges in income or household status, the certification period shall not be\nmore than two months; (iii)\nfor\nthose households which have little likelihood of changes in income and\nhousehold status, the certification period shall be up to 12 months; (iv)\nfor those households in which all adult\nhousehold members are disabled or elderly persons with very stable income, the\ncertification period shall be up to 24 months; (v) for those households whose primary source\nof income is from self-employment (including self-employed farmers) or from\nregular farm employment, including farm workers whose annual salaries are paid\non a scheduled and unchanging monthly basis, provided income can be readily\npredicted and household circumstances are not likely to change, the\ncertification period will be up to 12 months; (vi)\nfor all cases subject to six-month\nreporting under subdivision (d) of this section, the certification period will, notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, be six months, except\nfor those households residing within social services districts that have been\ngiven written permission by the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance\nto lengthen the certification periods to more than six months but not longer\nthan 12 months. For those social services districts authorized to lengthen the\ncertification periods beyond six months, households subject to six-month\nreporting shall be required to submit a periodic report in the sixth month in\naccordance with subdivision (e) of this section; and\n(vii)\nfor those households which are granted\nseparate household status, in accordance with section\n387.1\n(t)(2)(i)(c) and\n(d) of this Part because the household\nconsists of an individual and that individual's minor child(ren) living with\nthe individual's parent or sibling and purchasing and preparing meals separate\nfrom the parent/sibling, the eligibility/certification period will not exceed\nsix months. (3)\n\nHouseholds certified on an expedited basis that have provided all necessary\nverification prior to certification, shall be assigned normal certification\nperiods. Households that postponed verification may be certified only for the\nmonth of application (the month of application and the subsequent month for\nthose applying after the 15th of the month). A normal certification period may\nbe assigned to those households whose circumstances would otherwise warrant a\nlonger certification period. (4)\n\nSocial services districts may lengthen a household's certification period as\nlong as the total months of the certification period does not exceed the limits\ndescribed in subparagraphs (2)(i) through (vi) of this subdivision. In\nextending certification periods, a notice of intent must be sent advising the\nhousehold of its new certification period ending date. (5)\n\nSocial services districts may only\nshorten a household's certification period when the social services district\neither receives verified information that the household is ineligible for food\nstamps or the household has failed to cooperate with the social services\ndistrict in clarifying its circumstances. When a certification period is\nshortened pursuant to this paragraph, a notice of adverse action must be sent\nto the household. (b) The local department shall notify the household in writing of the decision\nregarding the household's eligibility for food stamp benefits based on an\ninitial application. Such notice shall be provided as soon as the decision is\nmade but no later than 30 days from the date of the initial\napplication. (c) All eligible SNAP\nhouseholds shall receive a payment access card, as prescribed by the\ndepartment, issued in the name of the household member who is authorized to\nreceive the household's SNAP allotment. (d) Six-month reporting. (1)\n\nThe following definitions are used in\nthis subdivision: (i) Six-month reporting\nrefers to a reporting system used for households with earned income in\naccordance with instructions from the Office of Temporary and Disability\n\nAssistance. It is a system in which information concerning the incomes and\ncircumstances of food stamp recipient households with earned income are\nrequired to report every six months at recertification or to submit a periodic\nreport. Households that are subject to six-month reporting are required to\nreport only changes in the amount of gross monthly income exceeding 130 percent\nof the monthly Federal poverty income guideline for their household size. In\naddition, households with able-bodied adults without dependents who are subject\nto the six-month reporting rules as described in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision must also report changes in work status that affect food stamp\neligibility. (ii)\n\nPeriodic report\nmeans a form upon which a recipient household that is subject to six-month\nreporting reports income and household circumstances for food stamps for the\nmost recent six-month period. Households are required to file such a report for\nsocial services districts that have been given written permission by the Office\nof Temporary and Disability Assistance to have certification periods of seven\nfull months or greater. The social services district must act on any change\nreported by such households on the periodic report in accordance with paragraph\n(e)(6) of this section. A periodic report is considered complete when the\nhousehold has: (a) answered all\nquestions; (b) provided\nverification of all reported income; and\n(c) signed and dated the report on or after\nthe last day of the fifth month of the report period. (iii)\n\nPrimary source means information\nreceived from employers concerning wages paid to a household, computer match\ninformation about Federal benefits received from the Social Security\n\nAdministration, information from the New York State Department of Labor or\nlocal district employment contractor that a food stamp recipient has failed to\ncomply with a food stamp work requirement, a determination by a court, administrative hearing or disqualification consent agreement of an intentional\nprogram violation, or actions taken by other programs under the authority of a\nsocial services district that affect budgeting for food stamps. (iv)\n\nProcess month means the month in which\ninformation contained in a periodic report or obtained during a certification\nis reviewed. With respect to information obtained at recertification, the\nprocess month is the last month of the authorization period. A new food stamp\nbudget is required to be authorized in the month following the month of a\nprocess month with respect to the information obtained if the information\nindicates a change has occurred and a new benefit level is to be determined as\na result of the change. (v) Verified upon receipt means that information is received from the primary\nsource and it is not questionable. A report of a change in income cannot be\nconsidered as verified upon receipt unless it includes an exact new income\namount, effective date of receipt and any other information needed to\nrecalculate the food stamp benefit amount. When information has been reported\nto another program area directly administered by the local social services\ndistrict such as Medicaid, or family and children services and the information\nis verified by that program, then the change must be considered verified by the\nfood stamp division of the local social services district and acted upon by the\ndivision if it would affect benefits or eligibility for food stamp\nbenefits. (2)\n\nFor any\nmonth that a household's gross income exceeds 130 percent of poverty, the\nhousehold must report their monthly income by the 10th day of the month\nfollowing the month in which they exceeded the limit. If a food stamp household\nsubject to six-month reporting fails, without good cause, to return a completed\nperiodic report by the 10th day of the process month, the social services\ndistrict must send a timely and adequate notice of discontinuance. Any changed\ncircumstances reported on the periodic report that results in changes in\nbenefits must be noticed to households using adequate notice. (3)\n\nGroup home households/residents with\nearned income are excluded from food stamp six-month reporting rules if they\nare in receipt of supplemental security income (SSI) or social security\ndisability benefits. Households eligible for a transitional benefit alternative\nare exempt from reporting changes in the monthly gross income level while they\nare in the transitional benefit period. At the end of the transitional benefit\nperiod, households subject to the six-month reporting rules will be required to\ncertify that their gross income does not exceed 130 percent of poverty. Households with certification periods of less than six months in duration are\nexcluded from the six-month reporting rules. (4)\n\nHouseholds subject to six-month reporting\nrules with able bodies adults without dependent(s) (ABAWD) may be required by\nthe social services district to report on a monthly basis changes in working\nhours that would affect food stamp eligibility. For a household subject to the\nfood stamp six-month reporting rules, the social services district must act on\nreported changes that affect food stamp eligibility and benefit amounts only if\nthe information is: (i) that the total\nmonthly household income exceeds 130 percent of poverty; (ii)\nverified upon receipt; (iii)\nreported on the food stamp periodic\nreport; (iv)\nreported at\nrecertification; (v) reported\npursuant to public assistance reporting requirements and the action is taken on\nthe public assistance budget. However, if a household in receipt of public\nassistance and food stamps fails to submit a public assistance quarterly\nreport, no action for discontinuance of food stamps for failure to submit the\nreport can be taken; (vi)\nvoluntarily reported and verified and the information increases the food stamp\nbenefit; (vii)\nthat a household\nrequests to have its food stamp case closed; or\n(viii)\nthat a household member does not meet\nABAWD requirements. For households in receipt of public assistance and food\nstamps subject to the six-month reporting rules, workers in the social services\ndistricts must not act on, or compute food stamp overpayment amounts for, change reports other than those listed in the subparagraphs of this\nparagraph. (5)\n\nIf the recipient responds to the discontinuance notice and submits a completed\nreport before the effective date of the discontinuance, the social services\ndistrict must accept the completed periodic report and void the notice of\ndiscontinuance. (6)\n\nGood cause for\nfailure to submit a completed periodic report. (i) Good cause for the failure to return a\ncompleted periodic report by the end of the process month exists only in the\nfollowing situations: (a) the recipient has a\nphysical or mental condition which prevents complete reporting; (b) the failure of the recipient to submit a\ncomplete report is directly attributable to Office of Temporary and Disability\n\nAssistance or social services district error; or\n(c) there are other extenuating circumstances\nunder which the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to fulfill the\nresponsibility to report for reasons beyond the recipient's control. (7)\n\nProjecting average\nincome. The amount of earned income used to determine food stamp benefits will\nbe based on an estimate of average monthly earnings. To project average monthly\nincome, a social services district must average the weeks of earned income\nreported, but no less than the most recent four weeks of income, or if there\nhas been a change expected to last at least 30 days, use the new information\nregarding the amount of pay and the frequency of pay. Income which is not of a\ncontinuing nature must not be included for purposes of projecting average\nincome. (8)\n\nAverage monthly income\nis applied against need to determine the amount of food stamp benefits for each\ncalendar month of a certification period. The amount of average earned income\napplied must be recalculated at recertification and when a periodic report is\nreceived by the agency. Adjustments to benefits will be made prospectively\nwhenever information is received in accordance with paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision. (9)\n\nVerification\nrequired with the periodic report. (i) The\nhousehold must provide verification of current income and any child care costs\nincurred in the most recent month whether or not changes have occurred in such\namounts. Failure to provide verification of current income will result in\nclosure of the food stamp case. Failure to provide verification of child care\ncosts will result in loss of child care deductions. (ii)\n\nThe household must provide verification\nof any other reported changes in household circumstances. The social services\ndistrict must act on any change which would produce a decrease in benefits\nwhether or not it is verified, but must not act on an unverified change which\nwould produce an increase in benefits. (iii)\nA social services district must afford\na household the opportunity to verify child care costs and costs identified in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this\nsection with respect to any change which it has initially failed to verify in\nthe period report. Changes reported in a periodic report will be considered as\nhaving been reported on the date the report is received. (iv)\nA social services district must not\nrequire verification of information prior to the most recent calendar month for\na periodic report. A social services district must not require verification of\nchanges reported outside of the periodic report and recertification that are\nnot required to be reported by a household that is subject to six-month\nreporting. (e) Household responsibility to report\nchanges in circumstances. (1)\n\nHouseholds\ncertified to receive food stamps must report the following changes: (i) changes in the sources of income, or\nchanges in the amount of gross monthly earned income of more than $100, gross\nmonthly unearned income from private sources of more than $100 or gross monthly\nunearned income from public sources of more than $25. This requirement does not\ninclude changes in the public assistance grant; (ii)\nall changes in household\ncomposition; (iii)\nchanges in\nresidence and any resulting changes in shelter costs; (iv)\nthe acquisition of a licensed\nvehicle; (v) when cash on hand, stocks, bonds, and money in a bank account or savings institution reach or\nexceed the appropriate allowable resource limit as set forth in section\n387.9\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Part; and\n(vi)\nactual utility\nexpenses claimed by a household if the source has changed or the amount has\nchanged by more than $25. (2)\n\nHouseholds certified to receive food\nstamps must report changes within 10 days of the date the change becomes known\nto the household. (3)\n\nHouseholds\napplying for food stamps must report all changes related to its eligibility and\nbenefits at the certification interview. Changes, as set forth in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision, which occur after the interview but before the date of the\nnotice of eligibility, must be reported by the household within 10 days of the\ndate of the notice of eligibility. (4)\n\nHouseholds subject to six-month reporting\nrules are not required to submit any reports of changes other than changes in\nmonthly gross income that exceed 130 percent of the monthly Federal poverty\nincome guidelines for their household size except as otherwise set forth in\nthis paragraph. Households subject to six-month reporting rules with\ncertification periods of seven full months or greater must submit a periodic\nreport for the most recent six-month period. Households with able bodies adults\nwithout dependences (ABAWDs) who are subject to six-month reporting rules as\nset forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this section must report as required by the\nsocial services district to meet ABAWD requirements. (5)\n\nChanges reported over the telephone by\nnon-six-month reporting households or in person by all food stamp households\nshall be acted upon in the same manner as those reported on the\n\nState-prescribed change report form. A supply of these report forms shall be\nprovided to the applicant/recipient of food stamps at initial certification and\nat recertification interviews. (6)\n\nPrompt action shall be taken on all reported changes to determine the effect on\nthe household's eligibility and food stamp allotment. All reported changes\nshall be documented in the case file according to the date reported. (i) For changes that result in an increase in\na household's benefits, other than changes described in subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph, the social services district must make the change effective no\nlater than the first allotment issued 10 days after the date the change was\nreported to the social services district. (ii)\n\nFor changes that result in an increase\nin a household's benefits due to the addition of a new household member who is\nnot a member of another certified household, or due to a decrease of $50 or\nmore in a household's gross monthly income, the social services district must\nmake the change effective no later than the first allotment issued 10 days\nafter the date the change was reported to the social services district. In no\nevent can the changes take effect any later than the month following the month\nin which the change is reported. (iii)\n\nAll changes, which result in an\nincrease in a household' s benefits, shall be verified according to the\nrequirements set forth in this Part prior to taking action on these changes. The household shall be allowed 10 days from the date the change is reported to\nprovide the required verification. The time frames for issuing the benefit\nshall run from the date the change was reported, not from the date of\nverification. Should the household fail to provide the required verification\nwithin 10 days after the change is reported but does provide verification at a\nlater date, then the time frames shall run from the date verification is\nprovided rather than from the date the change is reported. When the local\ndepartment fails to take action on a change which increases a household's\nbenefit within the time limits specified above, all lost benefits shall be\nrestored to the household. (iv)\n\nThe\nlocal department shall act upon changes that decrease a household's benefit\nlevel or make a household ineligible to participate in the food stamp program\nno later than the allotment for the month following the month in which the\nnotice of adverse action period has expired, provided a fair hearing and\ncontinuation of benefits have not been requested. Verification of changes that\ndecrease benefit levels must be obtained prior to recertification except as\nspecified for cases subject to six-month reporting rules in subdivision (d) of\nthis section. (v) Local departments\nshall file a claim against these households in accordance with section\n387.19\nof this Part which received\nbenefits to which they were not entitled because the household failed to report\na required change in circumstances as detailed above. If the discovery is made\nwithin the certification period, the household is entitled to a notice of\nadverse action if the household's benefits are reduced. (7)\n\nChanges in medical expenses discovered\nfrom a source other than the household and which require contact with the\nhousehold for verification purposes must not be acted upon until the household\nvoluntarily reports the change or is recertified. (f) Recertification. Timely\napplication/recertification must be completed and the household notified of\napproval or denial prior to the end of the household's current certification\nperiod. Eligible households must have an opportunity to participate in the food\nstamp program by the household's normal issuance cycle in the month following\nreceipt of a timely application/ recertification form. No food stamp benefits\nwill be continued to a household beyond the end of the certification period\nunless the household has been recertified. The processing requirements for\npublic assistance cases in receipt of food stamps, as set forth in section\n387.5\nof this Part will also apply\nat the time of recertification. Except as otherwise limited by section\n387.14\n(a)(4)(iii)\nof this Part, for households in which all members are recipients of ADC and/or\nSSI, categorical eligibility for food stamps must be assumed in the absence of\na timely redetermination of eligibility for such benefits; or granted if the\nconditions set forth in section\n387.14\n(a)(4)\nof\nthis Part are present at recertification. (1)\n\nLocal departments will send the households the expiration notice in a manner\nthat will ensure receipt no earlier than the first day of the second to the\nlast month of the certification period and no later than the first day of the\nhousehold's last month of certification. However, households initially\ncertified for one or two months will receive their notice of expiration at the\ntime of certification. (2)\n\nHouseholds which submit a recertification application to a local department by\nthe 15th day of the final month of certification will be considered to have\nmade a timely recertification application. Households receiving the notice of\nexpiration at the time of certification will have 15 days from the date of the\nnotice to file a timely recertification application. The recipient must be\ninterviewed and must submit all verification prior to the end of the final\nmonth of the certificate period to be entitled to uninterrupted benefits. The\nhousehold must be allowed at least 10 days from the date of the interview to\nsubmit any required verification that was not submitted during the interview. Any household not determined eligible in sufficient time to permit\nuninterrupted benefits due to the 10-day period for submission of additional\nverification, will, if eligible, receive a full month's benefit within five\nworking days after supplying the missing verification. (3)\n\nThe local department must promptly act on\nall timely recertification applications so as to ensure delivery of\nuninterrupted food stamp benefits to eligible households. Households receiving\nexpiration notices can not be required to appear for an interview prior to the\nlast month of their current certification periods. If the household fails to\nappear for a scheduled interview, fails to file the recertification application\nprior to the required time period or fails to provide missing verification by\nthe end of the 10-day time period referred to in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, the local department must deny the recertification\napplication. (g) (1)\n\nThe Federal or State government may\ninitiate certain mass changes. Mass changes may include, but are not limited\nto, adjustments to the income eligibility standards, the shelter and dependent\ncare deductions, the thrifty food plan and the standard deduction; annual and\nseasonal adjustments to social security, SSI and other Federal benefits; adjustments to public assistance and other changes in the eligibility criteria\nbased on legislative or regulatory actions shall be made in accordance with the\nfollowing: (i) Adjustments to eligibility\nstandards, allotments, deductions and utility standards shall be effective for\nall households at the same time. (ii)\n\nAdjustments to food stamp benefits shall\nbe effective in the same month as a change in public assistance payments unless\nthere is less than 30 days' notice of the change. In which event, the change\nshall be effective not later than the month following the change. (2)\nA notice of adverse action is\nnot required for mass changes due to changes in public assistance. However, notice of the change must be sent to all households prior to the change being\nput into effect. If a household requests a fair hearing, benefits must be\ncontinued at the former level only if the issue being appealed is that food\nstamp eligibility or benefit were improperly computed or that Federal law or\nregulation is being misapplied or misinterpreted by the department or by the\nsocial services agency. (3)\n\nMass\nchanges in Federal benefits such as social security or SSI shall be\nautomatically adjusted by the local department for purposes of calculating the\nhousehold's benefit level. The household shall not be responsible for reporting\nthese changes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
