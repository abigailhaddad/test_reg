This subdivision governs only judicial notice of adjudicative\nfacts. (2)\n\nKinds of facts. A\njudicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that\nit is either: (i) generally known\nuniversally, locally, or in the area pertinent to the event; or\n(ii)\ncapable of accurate and ready\ndetermination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be\nquestioned. (3)\n\nWhen\ndiscretionary. The military judge may take judicial notice, whether requested\nor not. The parties shall be informed in open court when, without being\nrequested, the military judge takes judicial notice of an adjudicative fact\nessential to establishing an element of the case. (4)\n\nWhen mandatory. The military judge shall\ntake judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary\ninformation. (5)\n\nOpportunity to be\nheard. A party is entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as\nto the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed. In the absence of prior notification, the request may be made after judicial\nnotice has been taken. (6)\n\nTime of\ntaking notice. Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the\nproceeding. (7)\n\nInstructing\nmembers. The military judge shall instruct the members that they may, but are\nnot required to, accept as conclusive any matter judicially noticed. (b) Judicial notice of law. (1)\n\nDomestic law. The military judge may take\njudicial notice of domestic law. Insofar as a domestic law is a fact that is of\nconsequence to the determination of the action, the procedural requirements of\n\nMil. R. Evid. 201--except Mil. R. Evid. 201(g)--apply. (2)\n\nForeign law. A party who intends to raise\nan issue concerning the law of a foreign country shall give reasonable written\nnotice. The military judge, in determining foreign law, may consider any\nrelevant material or source including testimony whether or not submitted by a\nparty or admissible under these rules. Such a determination shall be treated as\na ruling on a question of law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
