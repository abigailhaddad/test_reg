(2)\n\nEach clinic's total operating payment by\nvisit type shall be determined by multiplying the count of paid visits for the\nvisit type determined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision by the operating\ncomponent of its fee (\ni.e., full fee minus its capital cost\ncomponent) in effect on June 30, 2011 for the same visit type. OPWDD may adjust\nthese results to prevent a clinic from incurring a decrease or increase in\n\nMedicaid reimbursement disproportionate to that of the clinics within its peer\ngroup. (3)\n\nThe total operating\npayments by visit type determined in paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall be\nsummed and then divided by the clinic's total paid visits across all visit\ntypes.

Payment\nfor services provided during this phase shall reflect a blend of 50 percent\nclinic average legacy fee, 50 percent operating payment calculated under APG\nreimbursement methodology, plus capital add-on, if any. (3)\n\nThe third phase shall be a six month\nperiod beginning July 1, 2013. Payment for services provided during this phase\nshall reflect a blend of 25 percent clinic average legacy fee, 75 percent\noperating payment calculated under APG reimbursement methodology, plus capital\nadd-on, if any. (d) Payment for all services provided on or after January 1, 2014 shall be based in\ntotal on the APG reimbursement methodology. (e) Clinic treatment facilities that begin\noperation on or after July 1, 2011 shall be reimbursed in accordance with the\ntransition phase-in schedule identified in subdivision (c) of this section\nexcept that the average of the legacy fees for all clinic treatment facilities\nshall be used in the payment calculation, instead of the clinic-specific\naverage legacy fee.
