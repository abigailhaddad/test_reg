  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 70.22 - Physicians and surgeons medical malpractice policy provisions for the period commencing July 1, 2000; established rates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section 40 of chapter 266 of the Laws of 1986, as amended by section 10 of part JJ of chapter 407 of the Laws of 1999, requires the superintendent to establish rates for physicians and surgeons medical malpractice policies for the policy period July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, and establish a surcharge, of up to eight percent, on the rates for such medical malpractice policies for the policy period July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, if required to satisfy any deficiency for the policy periods July 1, 1985, through June 30, 1999. (b) (1)\n\nPursuant to part JJ of chapter 407 of the Laws of 1999, as amended by chapter 147 of the Laws of 2000, section\n5502 (c)\nof the Insurance Law was amended to provide for the dissolution of the Medical Malpractice Insurance Association (MMIA) at such time and under such conditions as the superintendent deems proper. As part of that dissolution process, MMIA ceased issuing and renewing policies effective July 1, 2000. (2)\n\nAs required by part JJ, the New York Medical Malpractice Insurance Plan (plan) has been established, pursuant to 11 NYCRR\n430\n(Regulation 170), to provide for the equitable distribution, to authorized medical malpractice insurers writing such coverage in New York, of the insureds of MMIA and health care practitioners and facilities which are otherwise unable to secure coverage in the voluntary market following the dissolution of MMIA. (3)\n\nPart JJ further requires that, upon initial distribution to the voluntary market, insureds of MMIA received policies with provisions and rates which are at least as favorable to the insured as those which they would have received if they were issued a renewal policy by MMIA. (4)\n\nTherefore paragraph (d)(5) of this section contains the established rates to be used for insureds distributed through the plan. (c) The superintendent has reviewed the reports mandated by section\n70.8\n(h) and former section\n70.9\n(f) of this Part, taken into account the factors set forth for consideration in section 10 of part JJ of chapter 407 of the Laws of 1999, and evaluated the financial condition of insurers issuing policies of medical malpractice insurance, as reflected by examinations conducted in accordance with section\n310\nof the Insurance Law. As a result of review and consideration, the superintendent has determined that a deficiency exists, in one instance, for the policy periods July 1, 1985, through June 30, 1999. (d) Rates and surcharges for occurrence policies providing primary coverage, up to $1 million/$3 million, issued or renewed during the period July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, shall be as follows: (1)\n\nFor Academic Health Professionals Insurance Association, the rate adjustments shall be as indicated in paragraph (8) of this subdivision, which also reflects classification modifications approved by the superintendent in accordance with section\n2307 (a)\nof the Insurance Law. No surcharge shall be collected for this insurer. (2)\n\nFor Frontier Insurance Company, the rate adjustments shall be as indicated in paragraph (9) of this subdivision, which also reflects classification modifications approved by the superintendent in accordance with section\n2307 (a)\nof the Insurance Law. No surcharge shall be collected for this insurer. (3)\n\nFor Group Council Mutual Insurance Company, rates shall be 10 percent greater than those established pursuant to section\n70.21\n(c)(3)\nof this Part. In addition, a surcharge of four percent shall be collected for this insurer. (4)\n\nFor Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company, the rate adjustments shall be as indicated in paragraph (10) of this subdivision, which also reflects classification modifications approved by the superintendent in accordance with section\n2307 (a)\nof the Insurance Law. No surcharge shall be collected for this insurer. (5)\n\nFor the Medical Malpractice Insurance Plan, the rates shall be those established for the Medical Malpractice Insurance Association pursuant to section\n70.21\n(c)(5)\nof this Part, as adjusted in paragraph (11) of this subdivision, which also reflects classification modifications approved by the superintendent in accordance with section\n2307 (a)\nof the Insurance Law. No surcharge shall be collected for this insurer. (6)\n\nFor Physicians Reciprocal Insurers, the rate adjustments shall be as indicated in paragraph (12) of this subdivision. No surcharge shall be collected for this insurer. (7)\n\nFor all other insurers, rates shall be those established by paragraph (4) of this subdivision, modified by the difference between the insurer's expenses and those of the Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company, unless the insurer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the superintendent that another rate is appropriate. No surcharge shall be collected for any such insurer unless specifically required by the superintendent.

(2)\n\nFor a first excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage, and purchased by a hospital in accordance with section 18 of chapter 184 of the Laws of 1988 as amended by chapter 147 of the Laws of 2000, the rate shall be 9.9 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established for the Medical Malpractice Insurance Plan in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section. (3)\n\nFor a second excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above the underlying primary coverage and the first layer of excess coverage described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, the rate shall be 5.0 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established for the Medical Malpractice Insurance Plan in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section. (f) Claims-made primary and excess coverage rates. (1)\n\nClaims-made coverage rate. The rate for a claims-made policy shall be the corresponding occurrence rate multiplied by the appropriate claims-made factor, as follows: Year in claims-made program\n\nClaims-made factor\n\nFirst\n31%\nSecond\n64\n\nThird\n85\n\nFourth\n94\n\nFifth\n99\n\nSixth\n102\n\nSeventh\n104\n\nEighth and later\n105\n(2)\n\nOptional extended reporting period (tail) rates. (i) The rate for optional tail coverage required to be offered for a claims-made policy shall be the corresponding occurrence rate multiplied by the appropriate tail factor, as follows: Number of years completed in claims-made program\n\nTail factor\n\nOne\n74.8%\nTwo\n122.1\n\nThree\n146.4\n\nFour\n162.4\n\nFive\n173.3\n\nSix\n181.0\n\nSeven\n186.7\n\nEight or more\n190.6\n(ii)\n\nFor a policy terminated on a date other than its anniversary date, the tail factor shall be obtained by interpolation, on a daily basis, between the tail factors applicable to the preceding and following policy anniversaries. (iii)\n\nFor a policy written at a reduced rate because the insured was eligible for a new- doctor discount, the tail premium shall be reduced by the percentage that the current year's rate (exclusive of any surplus contributions) was reduced as a result of such new-doctor discount. (g) Rates for claims-made policies where the physician, while receiving coverage under a claims-made policy, changes classification or territory. (1)\n\nWhen a physician insured under a claims-made policy changes either classification, territory or both, the rate applicable to such physician shall be adjusted to reflect the fact that claims made under the policy after the change could include claims for occurrences which took place under the former classification or territory. The presence of a loading for pre-paid extended reporting period coverage in the rate structure complicates what would otherwise be a relatively simple calculation, in that the amount of such loading applicable to the difference in rates before and after the change must be considered. Accordingly, all insurers should use the procedure established by section\n70.14\n(f)(2)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nAll insurers providing claims-made coverage subject to this Part shall: (i) amend their policy applications to require the applicant to identify every insurer which previously provided coverage on a claims-made basis and to indicate if and how any classification or territory has been modified since first entry into the claims-made program; (ii)\nconfirm the classification or territory information with the previous insurer or insurers; and\n(iii)\nfurnish, upon the written request of an insurer, or former or current insured, classification or territory information relative to such insured or former insured. (3)\n\nFor the purposes of this subdivision, the term\nclassification\nshall include changes from full-time to part-time or part-time to full-time practice. (h) Excess coverage-types of policies.
