  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 20.52 - Transportation differentials\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe class prices set forth in section\n20.50\nof this Part shall be subject\nto a transportation differential determined in accordance with subdivisions (a)\nthrough (e) of this section. (a) The\nmarket administrator shall determine a freight zone for each pool plant and\neach partial pool plant. Such freight zone shall be the shortest highway\nmileage from the plant to the nearest of the following points as computed by\nthe market administrator from data contained in Mileage Guide No. 5, without\nsupplements, issued on July 20, 1949, effective August 21, 1949, by the\n\nHousehold Goods Carriers' Bureau, Agent, Washington, D.C.: Mount Vernon or\n\nYonkers in the State of New York; Tenafly, Glen Ridge, East Orange, Elizabeth, Hackensack, Hillside, Irvington or Passaic in the State of New Jersey. The\nfreight zone for plants located in New York City, Nassau and Suffolk Counties\nin the State of New York, or in Essex, Hudson and Union Counties in the State\nof New Jersey, shall be in the 1- to 10-mile zone. The market administrator\nshall publicly announce the freight zones for pool plants. (b) The market administrator shall determine\nand publicly announce a freight zone for each minor civil division (township, borough, incorporated village or city) within which farms included in a pool or\npartial pool unit are located by computing the shortest highway mileage\ndistance from the nearest point in the minor civil division to the nearest\npoint specified in subdivision (a) of this section, using the mileage guide\nspecified in such subdivision supplemented by U.S. Geological Survey maps. In\nstates where the smallest governmental unit except for incorporated cities or\nvillages is the county, a zone for the county shall be determined in the same\nmanner as for minor civil divisions. The zone for each farm shall be the zone\nof the minor civil division or county in which the farm is located. (c) The differential rates applicable at\nplants shall be as set forth in the following schedule: A\nB\nC\nClasses\nI-A\nClasses\nII, Freight zone\n(miles)\nand I-B\nIII and III-A\n(cents per cwt)\n(cents per cwt)\n1-10\n+72.0\n+8\n11-20\n+69.5\n+8\n21-25\n+67.0\n+8\n26-30\n+67.0\n+7\n31-40\n+64.5\n+7\n41-50\n+62.0\n+7\n51-60\n+59.5\n+6\n61-70\n+57.0\n+6\n71-75\n+32.5\n+6\n76-80\n+32.5\n+5\n81-90\n+30.0\n+5\n91-100\n+27.5\n+5\n101-110\n+25.0\n+4\n111-120\n+22.5\n+4\n121-125\n+20.0\n+4\n126-130\n+20.0\n+3\n131-140\n+17.5\n+3\n141-150\n+15.0\n+3\n151-160\n+12.5\n+2\n161-170\n+10.0\n+2\n171-175\n+ 7.5\n+2\n176-180\n+ 7.5\n+1\n181-190\n+ 5.0\n+1\n191-200\n+ 2.5\n+1\n201-210\n0.0\n0\n211-220\n- 2.5\n0\n221-230\n- 5.0\n0\n231-240\n- 7.5\n-0\n241-250\n-10.0\n-0\n251-260\n-12.5\n-0\n261-270\n-15.0\n-0\n271-280\n-17.5\n-0\n281-290\n-20.0\n-0\n291-300\n-22.5\n-0\n301-310\n-25.0\n-0\n311-320\n-27.5\n-0\n321-330\n-30.0\n-0\n331-340\n-32.5\n-0\n341-350\n-35.0\n-0\n351-360\n-37.5\n-0\n361-370\n-40.0\n-0\n371-380\n-42.5\n-0\n381-390\n-45.0\n-0\n391-400\n-47.5\n-0\n(d) The differential rate applicable to each\npool unit or partial pool unit shall be computed each month as follows: multiply the volume of pool milk received from farms in each zone by the rate\nfor that zone as set forth in the schedule in subdivision (c) of this section, add the resulting values for all zones of the unit, divide such sum by the\ntotal volume of milk received by the unit and round to the nearest 0.5 cent. Rates shall be computed separately for columns B and C of such\nschedule. (e) In the event that a\nplant in the 401 miles and over freight zone becomes a pool plant, a 10-mile\nzone shall be determined for such plant and for each farm in any pool unit\ndelivering to such plant. The column B differentials in subdivision (c) of this\nsection shall be extended at the same rate as provided in such column or such\nplant or unit; provided, that in no case shall such differential cause the\nclass price or the uniform price for such plant or unit to be less than the\n\nClass III price for such plant or unit; provided further, that farms or units\ndelivering to such plant shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the\nplant. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n20.52\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
