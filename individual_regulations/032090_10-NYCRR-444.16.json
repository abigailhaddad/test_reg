These deductions represent the estimated amount of\ncurrent revenue that will not be realized as a result of credit\nlosses. (2)\n\nContractual\nadjustments. These adjustments represent the difference between full\nestablished charges for individual services and the contractual rates received\nor to be received from third-party payors for services\nrendered.
