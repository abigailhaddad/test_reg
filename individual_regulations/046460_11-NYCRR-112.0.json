  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 112.0 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nInsurers enter into arrangements that increase the transferring company's surplus to policyholders on the basis of a loss portfolio transfer at a cost or consideration below the amount of the incurred loss and loss adjustment expense reserves transferred. This Part has been promulgated because of the department's concerns that such transactions may be hazardous to policyholders or the citizens of this State and that proper recognition must be given to disclosure, accounting treatment and maintenance of reserves in connection with loss portfolio transfers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n112.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
