Tit. 9 § 358.5 - Approval process and responsibilities of qualified manufacturers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nOnly a qualified manufacturer may conduct\nbusiness in New York State with respect to any operator. An interested\nmanufacturer of a certified ignition interlock device seeking to conduct\nbusiness within New York State shall apply to the division to become a\nqualified manufacturer in one or more designated regions of New York\n\nState. (2)\n\nThe four regions of the\n\nState by counties for purposes of this Part are as follows: (i) Region 1: Allegany, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua, Chemung, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Orleans, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne, Wyoming, and Yates; (ii)\n\nRegion 2: Broome, Chenango, Clinton, Cortland, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Hamilton, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, Oswego, St. Lawrence, Tioga, and Tompkins; (iii)\n\nRegion 3: Albany, Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Montgomery, Orange, Otsego, Putnam, Rensselaer, Rockland, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Sullivan, Ulster, Warren, and Washington; and\n(iv)\n\nRegion 4: Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Queens, Richmond, Suffolk, and Westchester. (b) (1)\n\nThe format and content of any application\nshall be established by the division. The application deadline for any\ncontractual period of any manufacturer seeking approval of the division as a\nqualified manufacturer to conduct business in New York State shall be set by\nthe division. Nothing shall preclude the division from establishing an open\napplication process for any interested manufacturers seeking to conduct\nbusiness on or after such deadline and filing an application to the division\nfor approval. However, where approved, the contractual end date shall be\nconsistent with other qualified manufacturer agreements. The application shall\nrequire at a minimum that the manufacturer submit relevant information, reports, and other documents requested by the division with respect to\ncompetitive pricing, service performance, select one or more regions in which\nit shall agree to conduct business, and certify that it will comply with all\napplicable provisions specified in this Part with respect to service delivery. In addition, the manufacturer or its representative shall provide a signed\nstatement that the manufacturer or its representative will indemnify and hold\nharmless the State of New York, the division, the Department of Health, every\ncounty where it does business, and their officers, employees and agents from\nall claims, demands and actions as a result of property damage and/or injury or\ndeath to persons which arise, directly or indirectly, out of any act or\nomission by the manufacturer, its representative, or installation/service\nproviders relating to the installation, service, inspection, maintenance, repair, use and/or removal of the ignition interlock device. (2)\n\nEvery manufacturer who applies shall\nprovide a thorough description of each device intended for use in New York\n\nState, provide proof of such certification by the Department of Health for each\ndevice intended for use in New York State, and the fee structure associated\nwith that specific device. Descriptive information about the device shall\ninclude but not be limited to: make and model of device, special features of\nthe device such as camera, reporting capabilities, removable head, global\npositioning system, and real-time reporting. Fee structure information shall\ninclude any and all fees charged to the operator, including but not limited to\ninstallation fee, monthly fee, any special service fees, and de-installation\nfee. The proposed fee structure shall take into consideration and be based upon\nan anticipated 10 percent waiver of the fees by criminal courts due to operator\nunaffordability. Annually, on or about February 15th of each year, the division\nshall review requests by qualified manufacturers for rate adjustments which\nshall include information submitted by qualified manufacturers involving\nunaffordability waivers granted by courts. At its discretion, the division\nshall approve rate adjustments where appropriate. (3)\n\nEvery qualified manufacturer with a\ncertified device who wants any operational modification to the device must\nsubmit in advance necessary documentation to the Department of Health and\nobtain departmental approval before releasing the modified device. The\nmanufacturer shall notify the division in writing of their intent of any\noperational modification and also any subsequent approval and provide a written\nsummary of any requested or approved modification. Operational modification\nmeans any change to the product design or function that would or could affect\nthe devices anti-circumvention, anti-tampering or analytical features as\ndetermined by the Department of Health. (4)\n\nThe division shall classify all certified\nignition interlock devices into categories based upon features and provide such\nlist to every county. This classification system and subsequent device\nclassification is subject to change by the division as new information becomes\navailable.

Every qualified manufacturer shall enter into a contractual agreement\nfor a minimum period of three years with the division setting forth the\nrequirements of the qualified manufacturer and all of its installation/service\nproviders consistent with this Part and the application submission approved by\nthe division.
