Tit. 18 §§ 358-6.2 - Decision without hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon the commissioner's own motion or\nupon request of an appellant in cases in which there is no material issue of\nfact to be resolved, a decision may be issued without a hearing. The\ndetermination to issue a decision without a hearing rests solely within the\ndiscretion of the commissioner. (b) A request for a decision without a hearing must be accompanied by sufficient\ninformation to enable the commissioner to ascertain whether any unresolved\nmaterial issue of fact exists, and should contain a full and clear statement of\nthe issues and of the appellant's position on these issues. (c) When the commissioner determines that a\ndecision without hearing is appropriate, the OAH will send the request for a\ndecision without hearing, or the request for a hearing, along with any\nsupporting documents to the social services agency involved. Within 10 business\ndays of receipt of these documents, the social services agency must forward to\nOAH, the appellant, and the appellant's representative, a response containing\nsufficient information to ensure resolution of the dispute. (d) Within 10 business days of the receipt of\nthe documents submitted by the social services agency, the appellant or\nauthorized representative may submit comments or rebuttal to the OAH with\ncopies to the other parties. (e) At\nany point after a request for a decision without a hearing has been made, if it\nappears that there is a material and unresolved issue of fact relating to the\nissue or issues upon which the hearing was requested, the appellant and the\nsocial services agency will be informed that a fair hearing will be scheduled\nupon notice to all parties. (f) A\ndecision without a hearing will be issued by the commissioner based upon the\npapers submitted in accordance with this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
