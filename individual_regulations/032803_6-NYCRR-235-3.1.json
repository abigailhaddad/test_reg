offer for sale, or manufacture for sale in the State of New York any\nantiperspirant or deodorant which contains any compound that has been\nidentified by the CARB in Title 17, California Code of Regulations, Division 3, Chapter 1, Subchapter 7, section 93000 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) as a toxic air\ncontaminant. (c) 'Products that are\ndiluted prior to use'. (1)\n\nFor consumer\nproducts for which the label, packaging, or accompanying literature\nspecifically states that the product should be diluted with water or non-VOC\nsolvent prior to use, the VOC content limits specified in the Table of\n\nStandards in this Subpart shall apply to the product only after the minimum\nrecommended dilution has taken place. For purposes of this Subpart, minimum\nrecommended dilution shall not include recommendations for incidental use of a\nconcentrated product to deal with limited special applications such as\nhard-to-remove soils or stains. (2)\n\nFor consumer products for which the label, packaging, or accompanying\nliterature states that the product should be diluted with any VOC solvent prior\nto use, the VOC content limits specified in the Table of Standards in this\n\nSubpart shall apply to the product only after the maximum recommended dilution\nhas taken place. (d) 'Sell-through of products.' Sell-through period. Notwithstanding the provisions\nof subdivisions (a) or (g) of this section, a consumer product manufactured\nprior to the effective date specified for that product in the Table of\n\nStandards may be sold, supplied, or offered for sale after each of the\nspecified effective dates. This subdivision shall not apply to: (1)\nany consumer product that does not\ndisplay on the product container or package the date on which the product was\nmanufactured, or a code indicating such date, in accordance with section\n235-6.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart, or\n(2)\n\nSolid air fresheners\nand toilet/urinal care products that contain para-dichlorobenzene; these\nproducts are subject to the one-year sell-through period specified in\nsubdivision (n) of this section. (e) 'Products registered under FIFRA'. For\nthose consumer products that are registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, (FIFRA; 7\nU.S.C. section\n136, et. seq.) (see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title), the effective date of the VOC content limits\nspecified in Table of Standards in this Subpart is January 1, 2023. (f) 'Requirements for charcoal lighter\nmaterials'.

(2)\n'Certification requirements'. (i) No charcoal lighter material formulation\nshall be certified under this subsection unless the applicant for certification\ndemonstrates to the satisfaction of the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation that the VOC emissions from the\nignition of charcoal with the charcoal lighter material are less than or equal\nto 0.020 pound of VOC per start, using the procedures specified in the South\n\nCoast Air Quality Management District Rule 1174 Ignition Method Compliance\n\nCertification Protocol, dated February 28, 1991 (the South Coast Air Quality\n\nManagement District Rule 1174 Testing Protocol) (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). The\nprovisions relating to LVP-VOC in sections\n235-2.1\n(dg)\nand\n235-4.1\n(f) of this\n\nPart shall not apply to any charcoal lighter material subject to the\nrequirements of this subdivision and subdivision (a) of this section. (ii)\n\nThe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation may approve alternative test\nprocedures which are shown to provide equivalent results to those obtained\nusing the South Coast Air Quality Management District Rule 1174 Ignition Method\n\nCompliance Certification Protocol (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). (iii)\nA manufacturer or distributor of\ncharcoal lighter material may apply to the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation for certification of a charcoal\nlighter material formulation in accordance with this paragraph.

The provided material shall clearly show the\nusage directions for the product. These directions shall accurately reflect the\nquantity of charcoal lighter material per pound of charcoal that was used in\nthe South Coast Air Quality Management District Rule 1174 Ignition Method\n\nCompliance Certification Protocol (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) for that\nproduct, unless: ('1')\nthe charcoal lighter\nmaterial is intended to be used in fixed amounts independent of the amount of\ncharcoal used, such as certain paraffin cubes; or\n('2')\nthe charcoal lighter material is\nalready incorporated into the charcoal, such as certain bag light, instant\nlight or match light products. ('c')\nfor a charcoal lighter material which\nmeets the criteria specified in subclause ('b')('1') of this subparagraph, the\nusage instructions provided to the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall accurately reflect the quantity\nof charcoal lighter material used in the South Coast Air Quality Management\n\nDistrict Rule 1174 Ignition Method Compliance Certification Protocol (see Table\n1, section 200.9 of this Title) for that product; and\n('d')\nany physical property data, formulation\ndata, or other information required by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation for use in determining when a product\nmodification has occurred and for use in determining compliance with the\nconditions specified on the ACP agreement issued pursuant to this\nparagraph.

The director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation shall act on a complete application within 90 days\nafter the application is deemed complete. (3)\n\nNotice of modifications. For any charcoal\nlighter material for which certification has been granted pursuant to paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision, the applicant for certification shall notify the\ndirector, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation\nin writing within 30 days of: (i) any change\nin the usage directions; or\n(ii)\nany change in product formulation, test results, or any other information\nsubmitted pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision which may result in VOC\nemissions greater than 0.020 pound of VOC per start. (4)\n'Revocation of certification'. If the\ndirector, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation\ndetermines that any certified charcoal lighter material formulation results in\nVOC emissions from the ignition of charcoal which are greater than 0.020 pound\nof VOC per start, as determined by the South Coast Air Quality Management\n\nDistrict Rule 1174 Ignition Method Compliance Certification Protocol (see Table\n1, section 200.9 of this Title) and the statistical analysis procedures\ncontained therein, the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation shall revoke or modify the certification in\naccordance with Part 621 of this Title and the procedures therein as is\nnecessary to assure that the charcoal lighter material will result in VOC\nemissions of less than or equal to 0.020 pound of VOC per start.
