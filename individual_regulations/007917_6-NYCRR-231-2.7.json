  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-2.7 - Netting\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section represents a mechanism for avoiding a\ndetermination of applicability of this Subpart in those instances where a\nsignificant source project is proposed at an existing major facility. (a) Creditable emission increases and ERCs. (1)\n\nAny creditable emission increase or\nemission reduction credit shall be of the same class of nonattainment\ncontaminant. Any VOC may be substituted for any other VOC. (2)\n\nAny creditable emission increase or ERC\nwhich is used in a net emission increase determination shall occur at the same\nmajor facility as a proposed source project. (b) Net emission increase determination. A\nnet emission increase determination shall be confined to the appropriate\ncontemporaneous period(s) for a proposed source project, and is subject to the\nfollowing: (1)\nA net emission increase\ndetermination shall only be allowed at an existing major facility. (2)\n\nAt an existing major facility, a\nsignificant source project shall be subject to this Subpart unless the net\nemission increase associated with the proposed source project is demonstrated\nto be less than the corresponding significant net emission increase threshold\nin section 231-2.12 or\n231-2.13\nof this Subpart. (3)\n\nAny ERC (or portion thereof) which is\nused in a net emission increase determination of non-applicability shall be\ndescribed as a special condition in the permit for the proposed source project\nfor which the reduction is used. (4)\n\nAny creditable emission increase from an\nemission unit issued a permit for which an emission offset or an internal\noffset was obtained, shall not be considered in any subsequent net emission\nincrease determination. (c) Revisiting a net emission increase\ndetermination of non-applicability. Any source project proposed at an existing\nmajor facility subsequent to a net emission increase determination of\nnon-applicability for a previously permitted source project shall be evaluated\nby the applicant in terms of the effect the project emission potential of the\nproposed source project will have on the prior determination. If the permit\napplication for the proposed source project indicates it will commence\noperation subsequent to the close of the contemporaneous period for the\npreviously permitted source project, an enforceable condition shall be added to\nthe permit for the proposed source project prohibiting operation prior to this\ndate. If the permit application for the proposed source project indicates it\nwill commence operation during the contemporaneous period for the previously\npermitted source project and would as a result of such operation cause the\nprior net emission increase to exceed any significant net emission increase\nthreshold in section 231-2.12 or\n231-2.13\nof this Subpart, the\napplicant shall: (1)\nrequest a special permit\ncondition which prohibits the proposed source project from commencing operation\nuntil after the close of the contemporaneous period for the previously\npermitted source project; or\n(2)\nobtain additional ERCs, sufficient to preserve the prior net emission increase\ndetermination of non-applicability; or\n(3)\nsubmit applications requesting\nmodification of the permit for the previously permitted source project to\nreflect applicability of this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-2.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
