The commissioner shall design and distribute certificates of sale (form\nMV-50). (b) Obtaining and returning\ncertificates of sale. (1)\n\nThe requisition form\nfor certificates of sale should be submitted by mail to the address shown on\nthe requisition form. When reordering books of MV-50's, the requisition form\nmust be submitted with all completed books of form MV-50. The requisition form\nmust be signed by an officer, partner, individual owner, or any person\nauthorized by the dealer. (2)\n\nOld\nsupplies of certificates of sale (form MV-50) should be used up before new\ncertificates of sale are used. However, by March 1, 1993, only certificates of\nsale with a print date of \"2/92\" or later may be used. (3)\n\nWithin five business days from receipt of\na book of certificates, the dealer must notify the Division of Vehicle Safety\n\nServices of the department of any discrepancy between the certificates actually\nreceived and the certificates purportedly sent. At the expiration of such\nfive-day period, in the absence of notification to the contrary, it is presumed\nthat any book of certificates mailed or delivered to a dealer was received by\nthe dealer intact, and the dealer will be required to account for all\ncertificates so mailed or delivered to him. (4)\n\nBooks of form MV-50 must be kept in a\nsafe place where they will not be accessible to persons not directly connected\nwith the dealer's business. No dealer shall lend a book of certificates of sale\nor any certificate of sale. A dealer shall be in violation if unable to\nsatisfactorily account for every MV-50. (c) Use. (1)\n\nCertificates of sale. Form MV-50 shall be issued only if the vehicle is owned\nor controlled by the dealer or the dealer is making a courtesy delivery as\ndescribed in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. Form MV-50 must be used to\ntransfer ownership of all vehicles owned or controlled by the dealer, in\naddition to any other forms, such as a certificate of title, required by these\nregulations. (2)\n\nIt is the\nresponsibility of the retail dealer to classify each vehicle as retail or\nwholesale. If the vehicle is sold at retail, the dealer must further classify\nthe vehicle as \"New\", \"Used\", \"Demonstrator\" or \"Salvage\" by checking the\nappropriate box or boxes at the top of the form. (3)\nA retail dealer selling a vehicle as\n\"Wholesale\" or \"Salvage\" shall write \"VOID\" on the MV-TCR for that vehicle and\nleave the MV-TCR attached to the MV-50. (4)\nA wholesale dealer must use wholesale\nMV-50 (without MV-TCR attached) and classify each vehicle as wholesale by\nchecking the appropriate box at the top of the form. (5)\n\nThe dealer must use a certificate of sale\nin transferring the ownership of all vehicles, including dealer-to-dealer and\nout-of-state sales. (6)\nA form\nMV-50 marked \"wholesale\" will be valid only as proof of ownership. It will not\nbe acceptable for registration purposes. (d) No dealer shall transfer a certificate of\nsale (form MV-50) which is not completely filled out including signature to\nanother dealer or any person, except that unused certificates of sale must be\nreturned to the Department of Motor Vehicles, with the MV-TCR's\nattached. (e) Courtesy delivery. A\ncourtesy delivery occurs when a dealer is responsible for delivering a vehicle\nsold by another dealer, obtaining title and registration for the vehicle and\ncollecting any sales tax which may be due. A dealer may choose to treat a\ncourtesy delivery as a vehicle owned or controlled by that dealer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
