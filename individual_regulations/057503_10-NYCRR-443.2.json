  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 443.2 - Functional and responsibility concepts\n\nState Regulations\n[ 2010 ]\nIn developing this Listing of\n\nAccounts, it was necessary to choose between functional and responsibility\nconcepts of reporting. Both of these concepts result in the accumulation of the\nsame amount of total costs. However, because organizational structures vary\namong hospitals, responsibility reporting would not allow for comparability. On\nthe other hand, functions (Housekeeping, Dietary, Intensive Care, etc.) carried\nout by any hospital would be similar, thus a functional accounting system\nallows for comparability. For this reason, this Listing of Accounts is based\nupon functional reporting concepts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n443.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
