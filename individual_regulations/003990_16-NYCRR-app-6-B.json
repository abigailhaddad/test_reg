Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app 6-B\nState Regulations\nDECLARATION OF POLICY\nRE\nUTILITY EMPLOYEE PENSION COSTS\nConsistent with our opinion of March 9, 1950, we hold that\nemployee pensions are elements of current labor costs and as such constitute a\npresent benefit. The treatment of costs of employee pensions in the\ndetermination of rates has been given consideration and the following general\npolicy will govern in such proceedings. 1. All costs of a reasonable pension plan, not provided heretofore, will be allowed as operating expenses in determining\nrates. Where advance provision is being made for future pension payments, however, a portion of the charge may be considered deferrable to a later\nperiod, if in the judgment of the Commission an unreasonable proportion of the\npension cost is being charged currently. 2. In determining, for a utility subject to\n\nFederal income tax and making advance provision for pension payments, whether\nits pension plan is a reasonable one, the Commission will give consideration to\nwhether the plan is approved by or acceptable to the Commissioner of Internal\n\nRevenue for tax purposes. 3. Under\nordinary circumstances no portion of the pension charges will be disallowed on\nthe ground that it relates exclusively to a prior service period. However, where the adoption of a comprehensive program of advance provision is\nunreasonably deferred, the charges may be disallowed to the extent that the\nrecognized liability on the date of adoption is increased and the increase is\ndirectly attributable to the extended lapse of time. 4. Ordinarily a utility will not be permitted\nto spread over a period of less than ten years provision for that portion of\npension costs which are considered to arise from service prior to the date at\nwhich provision for future pension payments had been commenced or shall\nhereafter be commenced. The particular period is to be determined in each case\nwith due regard to the financial burden involved. 5. While paragraph 1 recognizes all employee\npension costs as operating expenses, this does not prohibit a utility from\nallocating to construction and retirement work orders and to clearing and other\naccounts an applicable portion of the cost of employee pensions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app\n6-B\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
