  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 154.8 - Net operating loss deduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Change of resident status from resident to nonresident. Where the Federal\nincome tax return of an individual or of a trust, for a taxable year in which\nsuch individual or trust changes resident status from that of a resident to a\nnonresident, includes a net operating loss deduction, the amount of net\noperating loss deduction for Federal income tax purposes will be considered a\nnet operating loss deduction on the New York State income tax return for the\nperiod of residence. Any excess of the amount of the net operating loss\ndeduction not applied on the New York State income tax return for the period of\nresidence may be applied on the New York State income tax return for the period\nof nonresidence, but only to the extent that such excess is based solely on\nitems of income, gain, loss and deduction derived from or connected with New\n\nYork State sources (see section\n132.7\nand Part 138 of this Title). (b) Change of resident status from nonresident to resident. In computing the New\n\nYork adjusted gross income of an individual to be reported on the New York\n\nState personal income tax return for the period of nonresidence or in computing\nthe New York taxable income of a trust for the period of nonresidence, any net\noperating loss deduction must, as required by section\n132.7\nand Part 138 of this Title, be based solely on items of income, gain, loss and\ndeduction derived from or connected with New York State sources. For purposes\nof this section, the source of the net operating loss must be determined by\nreference to the source of the items of income, gain, loss and deduction for\nthe year or years in which the net operating loss was sustained. A net\noperating loss deduction may be applied to the New York State income tax return\nfor the period of residence in the amount which would be allowed as a net\noperating loss deduction for Federal income tax purposes, computed, in\naccordance with Federal rules and practice applicable to net operating loss\ndeductions, as if a Federal income tax return had been filed for the period of\nresidence. (c) A net operating\nloss, sustained in the year the change of resident status occurs, may be a\ncarry-back or a carry-over to another taxable year under the following\nconditions: (1)\n\nIf the taxable year to which\nthe carry-back or carry-over is to be applied is a taxable year in which an\nindividual or a trust is a resident, such carry-back or carry-over may be\napplied on the New York State resident income tax return to the extent such\ncarry-back or carry-over is includible as a carry-back or carry-over in the\ncomputation of Federal adjusted gross income of an individual or Federal\ntaxable income of a trust for such taxable year, and only if the taxable year\nfor which the carry-back or carry-over is to be applied is a taxable year under\narticle 22 of the Tax Law. (2)\n\nIf\nthe taxable year to which the carry-back or carry-over is to be applied is a\ntaxable year in which an individual or a trust is a nonresident, such\ncarry-back or carry-over may be applied on the New York State nonresident\nincome tax return to the extent that such carry-back or carry-over is based\nsolely on items of income, gain, loss or deduction derived from or connected\nwith New York State sources, and only if the taxable year for which the\ncarry-back or carry-over is to be applied is a taxable year under article 22 of\nthe Tax Law. (d) For the\neffect of a net operating loss deduction in arriving at New York State minimum\ntaxable income, see Parts 122 and 141 of this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
