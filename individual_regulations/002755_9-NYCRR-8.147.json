Tit. 9 § 8.147 - Executive Order No. 147: A Special Prosecutor to Investigate and Prosecute Matters Relating to the Deaths of Civilians Caused by Law Enforcement Officers\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the Constitution of the State of New York obliges\nthe Governor to take care that the laws of New York are faithfully executed; and\nWHEREAS, I have solemnly sworn, pursuant to Article 13, Section 1 of the Constitution, to support the Constitution and faithfully\ndischarge the duties of the office of Governor; and\nWHEREAS, there have been recent incidents involving the\ndeaths of unarmed civilians that have challenged the public's confidence and\ntrust in our system of criminal justice; and\nWHEREAS, public concerns have been raised that such\nincidents cannot be prosecuted at the local level without conflict or bias, or\nthe public perception of conflict or bias; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to ensure that a full, reasoned, and independent investigation and prosecution of any such incident is conducted\nwithout conflict or bias, or the perception of conflict or bias; and\nWHEREAS, the foregoing compels me to conclude that my\nconstitutional obligations provide that in cases where an issue of a real or\nperceived conflict of interest exists, and to ensure full confidence in our\nsystem of criminal justice, a special prosecutor should be appointed with\nrespect to such incidents. Such appointment of a special prosecutor will\nsupersede in all ways the authority and jurisdiction of a county district\nattorney to manage, interpret, prosecute or inquire about such incidents; and\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M. CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, and particularly by subdivision 2 of section\n63\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, hereby require the Attorney General (hereinafter, the \"special\nprosecutor\") to investigate, and if warranted, prosecute certain matters\ninvolving the death of an unarmed civilian, whether in custody or not, caused\nby a law enforcement officer, as listed in subdivision 34 of section\n1.20\nof the Criminal Procedure Law.

The special prosecutor's jurisdiction will displace and supersede\nthe jurisdiction of the county district attorney where the incident occurred; and such county district attorney shall have only the powers and duties\ndesignated to him or her by the special prosecutor as specified in subdivision\n2 of section\n63\nof the\n\nExecutive Law; FURTHER, for any matter covered herein, the special\nprosecutor shall conduct a full, reasoned, and independent investigation\nincluding, but not limited to, (i) gathering and analyzing evidence, (ii)\nconducting witness interviews, and (iii) reviewing investigative reports, scientific reports, and audio and video recordings; FURTHER, for any matter covered herein, the special\nprosecutor shall, (i) attend in person, a term or terms of the County or\n\nSupreme Court to be held in and for the County of such appropriate jurisdiction\nconsistent with this Order, (ii) appear in person before any grand jury drawn\nfor any term(s) of said court, for the purpose of conducting any and all\nproceedings, examinations, and inquiries, and (iii) bring any and all criminal\nactions and proceedings which may be had or taken before said grand jury and\nother grand juries concerning or relating to any and all alleged unlawful acts\nas described by this Order; FURTHER, for any matter covered herein, the special\nprosecutor will provide to me, or my designee, a report on all cases where, (i)\nthe special prosecutor declines to present evidence to a grand jury regarding\nthe death of a civilian as described in this Order, whether in custody or not, allegedly caused by a law enforcement officer, or (ii) the grand jury declines\nto return an indictment on any charges.
