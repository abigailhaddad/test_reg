B. The term \"hearing officer\" shall mean a\nperson designated and empowered by an agency to conduct adjudicatory\nproceedings as defined in this Order, including but not limited to hearing\nofficers, hearing examiners and administrative law judges; provided, however, that such term shall not apply to the head of an agency or to members of a\nstate board or commission. C. The\nterm \"adjudicatory proceedings\" shall mean any activity before an agency in\nwhich a determination of legal rights, duties or privileges of named parties\nthereto is required by law to be made only on a record and after an opportunity\nfor a formal adversarial hearing; provided, however, that such term shall not\napply to (1) a rule making proceeding, (2) an employee disciplinary action or\nother personnel action pursuant to article five of the civil service law or (3)\nrepresentation proceedings conducted by the State Labor Relations Board and the\n\nPublic Employment Relations Board. II. General Principles\nA. Every agency that conducts adjudicatory\nproceedings shall insure that such proceedings are impartial, efficient, timely, expert and fair. B. 1. Unless otherwise authorized by law and\nexcept as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision, a hearing officer\nshall not communicate, directly or indirectly, in connection with any issue\nthat relates in any way to the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding pending\nbefore the hearing officer with any person except upon notice and opportunity\nfor all parties to participate. 2. A hearing officer may consult on questions of law with supervisors, agency\nattorneys or other hearing officers, provided that such supervisors, hearing\nofficers or attorneys have not been engaged in investigative or prosecuting\nfunctions in connection with the adjudicatory proceeding under consideration or\na factually related adjudicatory proceeding. Hearing officers may also consult\nwith supervisors, other hearing officers, support staff or court reporters on\nministerial matters such as scheduling or the location of a hearing. The head\nof each agency shall strictly enforce the prohibition set forth in this\nparagraph B. 3. Subdivision one of\nthis paragraph shall not apply (a) in determining applications for initial\nlicenses for public utilities or carriers or (b) to proceedings involving the\nvalidity or application of rates, facilities, or practices to public utilities\nor carriers. C. No\nagency shall consider whether a hearing officer's rulings, decisions or other\nactions favor or disfavor the agency or the State in establishing the hearing\nofficer's salary, promotion, benefits, working conditions, case assignments or\nopportunities for employment or promotion. The work of hearing officers shall\nonly be evaluated on the following general areas of performance: competence, objectivity, fairness, productivity, diligence and temperament. D. No agency shall establish quotas or\nsimilar expectations for any hearing officer that relate in any way to whether\nthe hearing officer's rulings, decisions or other actions favor or disfavor the\nagency or the State. E. In any\npending adjudicatory proceeding, the agency may not order or otherwise direct a\nhearing officer to make any finding of fact, to reach any conclusion of law, or\nto make or recommend any specific disposition of a charge, allegation, question\nor issue, except by remand, reversal, or other decision on the record of the\nproceeding; provided, however, that such provision shall not preclude a\nsupervisor from giving legal advice or guidance to a hearing officer where the\nsupervisor determines that such advice or guidance is appropriate to assure the\nquality standards of the agency or to assure consistent or legally sound\ndecisions. F. If the head of an\nagency, or a designee, issues a decision that includes findings of fact or\nconclusions of law that conflict with the findings, conclusions or recommended\ndecision of the hearing officer, the head of the agency, or the designee, shall\nset forth in writing the reasons why the head of the agency reached a\nconflicting decision. III. Administrative Adjudication Plans\nA. Every agency responsible for\nadministrative adjudication shall develop an administrative adjudication plan. No later than February 1, 1990, each agency shall make its proposed plan\navailable to the public for comment and shall publish a notice of the\navailability of such plan in the State Register at the first available date. No\nlater than March 30, 1990, each agency shall conduct at least one public\nhearing to solicit comments on the plan. Each agency shall give full\nconsideration to the comments received from the public and shall issue a final\nadministrative adjudication plan no later than April 30, 1990. Notice of the\navailability of such final plan shall be published in the State Register and\nshall address the comments received from the public. All such plans shall be\nfully implemented no later than July 1, 1990 except to the extent\nappropriations necessary to implement the plan are not available. An agency may\namend such plan as necessary following notice of a proposed amendment and an\nopportunity for public comment. B.

An attestation by the head of\nthe agency that the plan adheres to the principles of administrative\nadjudication set forth in section two of this Order. 2. a. An\norganization of administrative adjudication that ensures that hearing officers\ndo not report with regard to functions that relate to the merits of\nadjudicatory proceedings to any agency official other than the head of the\nagency, a supervisor of hearing officers or the general counsel. Wherever\npractical, hearing officers shall be assigned to an administrative unit made up\nexclusively of hearing officers, supervisors and support staff. The unit may be\npart of the agency counsel's office but may not be part of any agency bureau, office or division with programmatic functions unless such functions are not\nthe subject of adjudicatory proceedings within the agency nor may it include\nattorneys responsible for prosecutions or other adversarial presentation of\nagency position. Unless otherwise proscribed by law, hearing officers may be\nassigned duties in addition to serving as a hearing officer provided that (1)\nsuch duties do not conflict with the hearing officer's responsibilities as a\nhearing officer and (2) such duties do not involve functions related to\nprosecutions or adversarial presentations of agency positions. Hearing officers\nmay be assigned to conduct investigatory hearings provided that the standards\nof independence and objectivity specified in this Order are adhered\nto. b. An agency may establish an\norganization of administrative adjudication for less complex cases that does\nnot satisfy the requirements of paragraph a of this subdivision provided that\nany such organization and its justification is set forth in the agency's\nadministrative adjudication plan. c. In order to comply with the requirement\nthat a hearing officer not report with regard to functions that relate to the\nmerits of adjudicatory proceedings to any agency official other than the head\nof the agency, a supervisor of hearing officers or the general counsel as set\nforth in paragraph a of this subdivision, an agency may request the services of\na hearing officer from a different agency. No later than January 15, 1990, the\n\nDivision of the Budget, in consultation with the Office of Business Permits and\n\nRegulatory Assistance (\"OBPRA\"), shall develop a plan under which agencies may\nshare the services of hearing officers where necessary. The Office of Business\n\nPermits and Regulatory Assistance shall develop and maintain a register of\nhearing officers that may be available to conduct adjudicatory proceedings in\nagencies other than the agency that employs them. 3. Provisions for the hiring of hearing\nofficers that allow, to the extent practical and consistent with the Civil\n\nService Law, opportunities for non-agency personnel to compete for open hearing\nofficer positions. 4. Location of\nhearing officers that separates, to the extent practical, hearing officers, supervisors and support staff from other agency staff. 5. Duly promulgated procedural regulations\ngoverning adjudicatory hearings that include, without limitation, requirements\nfor clear and detailed notices of hearing and statements of charges; permission\nfor answers and responsive pleadings, where appropriate; provisions for\ndiscovery to the extent permitted by the agency; and a procedure for any party\nto request recusal of a hearing officer. 6. A description of continuing education and\ntraining programs for hearing officers. Training programs shall include an\nexplanation of the need for objectivity and fairness and the avoidance of a\npro-agency bias.

A\ndescription of efforts to consult and share resources with other\nagencies. 8. The use of outside\nhearing officers, to be paid on a per diem or contract basis, where such\noutside officers are necessary to implement the provisions of this\n\nOrder. 9. For agencies that\nadjudicate 50 or more adjudicatory proceedings per year, a management system\nintended to effect timely disposition of adjudicatory proceedings. 10. A description of the agency's existing\nsystem of administrative adjudication and a discussion of the changes in such\nsystem that the proposed plan would effect. 11. The summary of the agency's rules\ngoverning procedures on adjudicatory proceedings and appeals required pursuant\nto subdivision three of section 301 of the State Administrative Procedure\n\nAct. IV. Oversight\nA. OBPRA shall monitor the\ncompletion and filing of proposed and final administrative adjudication plans. To assist OBPRA in this effort, every agency shall send their proposed and\nfinal administrative adjudication plan to OBPRA. B. OBPRA shall review any complaints from an\nindividual or organization that an agency's system of administrative\nadjudication is not consistent with this Order. However, OBPRA shall have no\njurisdiction to review a complaint until a complainant has exhausted all of the\ncomplainant's administrative and judicial remedies with regard to the\nadministrative proceeding at issue. In reviewing any such complaint, OBPRA\nshall not review the merits of an individual case determination nor shall it\nreview issues that have been ruled upon by a court. OBPRA's review shall be\nlimited to whether the system of adjudication utilized by the agency is\nconsistent with the provisions of this Order. C. In the event that OBPRA's review\nidentifies areas of an agency's system of administrative adjudication that\nappear to be inconsistent with the provisions of this Order, OBPRA shall notify\nthe agency and the complainant. Such notification shall be advisory in nature\nand not binding on an agency. V. Reporting\n\nNo later than December 1, 1990, and every two years\nthereafter, every agency shall make public a report that sets forth the steps\ntaken by the agency to comply with this Order. Such report shall also include\nstatistics on Article 78 proceedings brought against the agency, including the\noutcome of such proceedings and the reasons for any reversal or modification of\nan agency determination. VI. Public Authorities and Other Agencies\n\nPublic authorities and corporations and agencies not\ncovered by this Order are encouraged to administer their systems of\nadministrative adjudication in a manner consistent with the principles of this\n\nOrder.
