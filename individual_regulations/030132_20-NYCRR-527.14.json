  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 527.14 - Racehorses\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1105(a), 1110, 1111(g), 1115(a)(6), 1118(2), (3), (7), (9) and (10)\n(a) Imposition. (1)\n\nGeneral. (i) A sales tax is imposed on the receipts\nfrom the retail sale of a racehorse in this State. (ii)\n\nUse tax may be imposed on the amount\npaid by a resident of New York State on the purchase of a racehorse which was\npurchased out of state and subsequently brought into New York State for racing\npurposes. (2)\n\nSpecial\nrules. The sales and use tax treatment of the receipts from the\nretail sale or use of a racehorse is unique in certain transactions. (i) Special rules concerning the imposition\nand liability for the sales tax in respect to a racehorse purchased at a\nclaiming race within New York State may be applicable (see paragraph [c][2] of\nthis section). (ii)\n\nExceptions to\nthe imposition of the use tax where a racehorse's use within the state meets\ncertain criteria may be applicable (see clause[d][1][iii][\na\n]\nof this section). (iii)\nA\nlimitation as to the amount of the base receipts upon which the use tax is\ncomputed may be applicable (see clause [d][1][iii][\nb\n] of this\nsection). (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nThe term\nracehorse\nwhen used in this section shall include\nthoroughbred, standardbred and quarter horse. (2)\n\nThe term\nresident\nof New\n\nYork State and/or local taxing jurisdiction for the purpose of this section\nmeans a resident as described in section\n526.15\nof\nthis Title. A person who carries on any activity preparatory to racing, maintains a stable, or races horses on tracks within New York State is\nconsidered to be conducting a business, trade or profession within the State\nwithin the meaning and intent of such definition. (i) Activities preparatory to racing are\nthose acts which enable a person to pursue a racing operation. These activities\ninclude but are not limited to: (a) the entry\nof horses in races; (b) the hiring\nof grooms, trainers, jockeys, or drivers; and\n(c) the registration with a jockey club at\nvarious New York State tracks. The mere possession of a license by any person (not\notherwise a resident) which is not accompanied by one or more other activities\nwill not result in resident status. (ii)\n\nThe possession of a license to race in\n\nNew York State by any person accompanied by any of the other activities\npreparatory to racing will result in such person having resident status for\npurposes of the sales and use taxes for the remainder of the calendar year\ncovered by the license to race in New York State. (3)\n\nThe term\nat the time of\npurchase\nwhen used in this section shall mean, in the case of a sale\nof a racehorse, the date title has transferred from the seller to the\npurchaser. (4)\n\nThe term\nclaiming race\nis a race in which every horse is entered at a\nprice and may be claimed for its entered price by an owner registered in good\nfaith for racing at that meeting. (5)\n\nThe term\nracing events\nincludes horse races upon which parimutuel betting is authorized by law and\nhorse races at which prize or purse money is awarded regardless of whether such\nevents are betting events. (c) Sales tax. (1)\n\nThe sales tax due is based on the\nreceipts from the retail sale of a racehorse computed at the combined New York\n\nState and local sales tax rate in effect in the jurisdiction where delivery of\nthe racehorse is made. (i) The purchase of an\ninterest in a horse is a taxable purchase. (ii)\n\nWhen delivery is made within New York\n\nState, the purchase of a racehorse by a resident or nonresident, other than\nwhen a horse is purchased exclusively for breeding purposes, is subject to the\nsales tax. (iii)\n\nThe trading of\nracehorses is a taxable transaction when delivery of either or both of the\nracehorses takes place in New York State. Sales tax is due based on the\nconsideration given in trade. Thus tax due in respect of a horse accepted in\ntrade and delivered in New York State is based upon the current market value of\nthe horse given in trade plus any other consideration which may have been\npaid. (iv)\n\nThe leasing of a\nracehorse is considered to be a taxable transaction when delivery of the\nracehorse occurs in New York State. The sales tax is due on the amounts paid by\nthe lessee to the lessor. (v) When\na horse breeder transfers ownership of a racehorse and later reacquires the\nsame racehorse, the reacquisition is considered a purchase. If the delivery of\nthe racehorse takes place within New York State, a sales tax is due on the\nprice paid upon reacquisition. (vi)\n\nThe exemption from the compensating use tax provided for horses purchased\noutside New York State and not entered into racing events on more than five\nracing days in New York State in any one calendar year (see subdivision [d] of\nthis section) is not applicable to purchases of racehorses subject to sales tax\nregardless of whether the seller neglected to collect such tax. (vii)\n\nIn general, the syndication of a\nracehorse is considered a sale of the horse and is subject to the sales tax, except when the horse is purchased exclusively for breeding purposes. (a) As syndication of a racehorse frequently\nprovides for various contingencies not common to other transactions, taxability\ncannot be ascertained unless all the facts and the syndication agreement are\nsubmitted for review. (b) When\nsubmitting such information, please mail to Central Office Audit Bureau, Casual\n\nSales Unit, Bldg. 9, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. (viii)\n\nWhen remitting payment of\nthe tax due on the purchase of a racehorse, submit a copy of the original\ninvoice showing the total price paid for the racehorse and the computations\nused in determining the amount of the tax due. (2)\n\nClaiming race. (i) A sale of a racehorse is deemed to have\noccurred when a horse is claimed in a claiming race. Title is passed once the\nrace begins and sales tax is due on the purchase price of any racehorse claimed\nin a claiming race conducted within New York State. (ii)\n(a) On\nor after July 1, 1985, the purchase of a racehorse made through a claiming race\nwithin New York State is subject to the sales tax only on that portion of the\ntotal purchase price which exceeds the highest of any prior purchase price paid\nfor the same horse in a claiming race conducted within New York State during\nthe same calendar year. (b) Where\nno previous purchase has been made through a claiming race conducted within New\n\nYork State in the same calendar year, the full purchase price is subject to the\nsales tax. (c) The provisions in\nclauses (\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this subparagraph are\napplicable only to claiming races conducted within New York State; they are not\napplicable to other purchases of racehorses within or without New York State or\nto purchases of racehorses in claiming races conducted outside New York State. Example 1: On August 2, 1985, a racehorse is purchased at Saratoga\n\nFlat Track by placing a claim of $15,000 before the start of the claiming race. This horse had not been sold during 1985 through a claiming race conducted in\n\nNew York State prior to the second of August. Sales tax is due on the total\npurchase price. Example 2: A claim of $21,000 was placed for the purchase of a\nracehorse at Belmont Racetrack on June 3, 1985, before the start of a claiming\nrace. The horse had been bought through a claiming race at Belmont Racetrack on\n\nApril 30, 1985 for the purchase price of $19,000. Sales tax is due on the full\npurchase price of each transaction, since the amendment to the Tax Law did not\ntake effect until July 1, 1985. If both transactions had taken place after July\n1, 1985, sales tax would have been due on $19,000 (the amount of the first\npurchase) and on $2,000 (the difference between $19,000 and the higher purchase\nprice of $21,000) in respect to the second purchase. Example 3: A claim of $14,000 was placed for the purchase of a\nracehorse at Aqueduct Racetrack on November 30, 1985, before the start of a\nclaiming race. The horse had been purchased through a claiming race at\n\nChurchill Downs in Kentucky on July 6, 1985. New York sales tax is due on the\nfull $14,000 purchase price at the New York claiming race without reduction\nsince the previous sale was not at a claiming race held in New York\n\nState. Example 4: A claim of $17,000 was placed on the purchase of a\nracehorse entered in a claiming race at Roosevelt Raceway on July 4, 1986. The\nsame horse had been purchased through a claiming race at the Syracuse Fair\n\nGrounds on September 11, 1985 for $15,000. Sales tax is due on the full $15,000\npurchase price paid in 1985 and on the full $17,000 purchase price paid in\n1986, since the two purchases were not within the same calendar year. Example 5: During the same calendar year a racehorse was sold in\nclaiming races at Roosevelt Raceway for $10,000 in July, at Saratoga Raceway\nfor $15,000 in August and at Monticello Raceway for $25,000 in September. Tax\nis due on the full $10,000 purchase price for the Roosevelt Raceway sale. On\nthe Saratoga Raceway sale, tax is due on $5,000, which is the excess of the\nsales price paid on the Saratoga Raceway sale over the Roosevelt Raceway sale. On the Monticello Raceway sale, tax is due on $10,000 which is the amount the\n\nMonticello Raceway sale exceeded the highest price paid in any prior claiming\nrace within New York State during the same calendar year. Example 6: During the same calendar year a racehorse was sold in\nclaiming races at Roosevelt Raceway for $27,000 in July, at Saratoga Raceway\nfor $20,000 in August and at Monticello Raceway for $18,200 in September. Tax\nis due on the full $27,000 purchase price for the Roosevelt Raceway sale. Since\nthe purchase prices of the subsequent sales in the same calendar year did not\nexceed the first purchase price, no additional tax is due on the subsequent\nsales. Example 7: During the same calendar year a racehorse was sold in\nclaiming races for $25,000 at Saratoga Raceway on the 10th of August, at the\n\nSyracuse Fair Grounds for $20,000 on the 31st of August and at Yonkers Raceway\nfor $30,000 in September. Sales tax is due on the full $25,000 purchase price\nfor the Saratoga Raceway sale. No sales tax is due on the purchase price of\n$20,000 paid at the Syracuse Fair Grounds as the purchase price paid on the\nsecond sale did not exceed the first purchase price. Sales tax is due on $5,000\nwhich is the amount the third purchase price ($30,000) exceeds the highest\nprevious purchase price ($25,000) subject to the tax at any claiming race held\nwithin New York State during the calendar year. (d) Compensating use tax. (1)\n(i) General. Except as provided in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, the compensating use tax due is computed\non the purchase price paid for a racehorse which was purchased out of state\n(including a racehorse purchased in New York State which was delivered out of\nstate to the purchaser by the seller) if at the time of purchase, the purchaser\nwas a resident of New York State (as resident is described in paragraph [2] of\nsubdivision [b] of this section) and if the racehorse is subsequently brought\ninto New York for racing events. (ii)\n\nThe term\nat the time of\npurchase\nis used in conjunction with the term\nresident\nin determining the tax status of a racehorse used\nwithin New York State at a subsequent date. (iii)\n\nSpecial rules. (a) No use tax is due in respect to a horse\npurchased outside New York State and brought into the State for the purpose of\nentering racing events or preparing therefor if the horse is not entered into\nracing events on more than five days in any one calendar year. (b) The compensating use tax applies to the\nfirst $100,000 of the value (purchase price or current market value not to\nexceed cost) of a racehorse acquired outside New York State. Use tax is not due\nto the extent that the value of the horse (purchase price or current market\nvalue not to exceed cost) exceeds $100,000. Thus when a New York State resident\npurchases a racehorse outside of New York State and subsequently brings it into\n\nNew York State for the purpose of entering the horse into racing events, a\ncompensating use tax is due when the horse is entered into racing events on\nmore than five days of racing in any one calendar year. The amount of the\npurchase price paid in excess of $100,000 is not subject to the use\ntax. (c) A credit for sales and use\ntaxes paid to another state or jurisdiction may be allowed against the amount\nof any use tax due (see subdivision [e] of this section). (iv)\n\nRacehorses purchased out of state by\npurchasers who were not residents of New York State at the time of purchase are\nnot subject to the compensating use tax regardless of how many racing events\nsuch racehorses enter in any calendar year. (2)\n\nThe compensating use tax becomes due on\nthe transaction described in paragraph (1)(i) of this subdivision when the\nracehorse is entered into racing events on more than five days in any one\ncalendar year. The amount subject to tax (which shall not exceed the first\n$100,000 of the value with respect to any single racehorse) is determined as\nfollows: (i) if the racehorse was used outside\n\nNew York State for six months or less from the date of purchase prior to its\nfirst use within New York State, the compensating use tax due is based on the\npurchase price; or\n(ii)\nif the\nracehorse was used outside of New York State for more than six months from the\ndate of purchase prior to its first use within New York State, the compensating\nuse tax due is based on the current market value, not to exceed cost, at the\ntime of first use within New York State. Example 8: A nonresident, Mr. Ajax, who previously was not licensed\nand did not race or train horses or otherwise engage in business within New\n\nYork State applies for and receives a license to race in New York State for the\ncurrent calendar year. The license covers the period of January 1st through\n\nDecember 31st but Mr. Ajax does not participate in any activities preparatory\nto racing until January 10th of the current year. Mr. Ajax is not considered to\nbe a resident of New York State for racing purposes until January 10th of the\ncurrent year. Mr. Ajax made out of state purchases of racehorses during the\ncurrent calendar year. The first purchase was made on the 2nd of January and\nthe second purchase was made on the 23rd of January. Subsequently the two\nhorses were brought into and raced in racing events in New York State on eight\ndays each. Since Mr. Ajax was not a resident of New York State at the time of\npurchase of the first racehorse on the 2nd of January, Mr. Ajax does not owe\nany use tax when the first horse is brought into and raced in New York State. As Mr. Ajax was a resident of New York State at the time of purchase of the\nsecond horse on the 23rd of January and the horse was entered into racing\nevents in New York State on more than five days in the calendar year, Mr. Ajax\nowes a compensating use tax on the first $100,000 of the value of the horse\n(the purchase price or current market value not to exceed cost) when the horse\nis entered into a racing event on the sixth day. Example 9: Mr. Collins, while engaged in racing activities in New York\n\nState, made an out of state purchase of a racehorse which was shipped into New\n\nYork State and entered into racing events within six months of the date of\npurchase. During a two-month period within the calendar year, the racehorse was\nentered into racing events on three days and then shipped back out of state for\nthe rest of the calendar year. As the racehorse was not entered into racing\nevents on more than five days in the calendar year, Mr. Collins does not owe a\ncompensating use tax on the value of the racehorse. In the subsequent calendar\nyear the racehorse was brought back into New York State and entered into racing\nevents on 10 days. Upon entering the racehorse in a racing event on the sixth\nday Mr. Collins owes a compensating use tax on the first $100,000 of the value\nof the racehorse. As the racehorse was used in New York State within six months\nof the date of purchase for racing events in the first calendar year, the\ncompensating use tax due is computed on the consideration paid for the purchase\nof the horse (the tax is not imposed upon the amount of such sum that exceeds\n$100,000). Example 10: Mr. Jones, while engaged in racing activities in Yonkers, New York (8 1/4 percent combined State, MCTD and local tax rate) purchases a\nracehorse in Maryland. The following week the horse is brought into New York\n\nState and entered into racing events at the Saratoga Raceway (7 percent\ncombined State and Saratoga County tax rate). Upon entering the horse in racing\nevents on more than five days in that same calendar year at the Saratoga\n\nRaceway, a compensating use tax becomes due only at the 4 percent State tax\nrate since Mr. Jones was a resident of New York State but not a resident of\n\nSaratoga because at the time of purchase Mr. Jones was engaged in business\nactivities within the State but was not engaged in such activities within\n\nSaratoga County. Example 11: In addition to racing in the events described in Example\n10, the racehorse is shipped from Saratoga and entered into one racing event at\n\nRoosevelt Raceway (8 percent combined State, MCTD and county tax rate). An\nadditional tax at the 1/4 percent tax rate for the Metropolitan Commuter\n\nTransportation District is not due as the horse was not entered in racing\nevents on more than five days at the Roosevelt Raceway. The additional tax at\nthe 3 3/4 tax rate for the County of Nassau is not due (regardless of the\nnumber of racing events entered) as Mr. Jones was not a resident of Nassau\n\nCounty at the time of purchase. Example 12: In addition to racing in the events described in Examples\n10 and 11, the racehorse is shipped from Roosevelt Raceway to be entered in two\nracing events at Yonkers Raceway (8 1/4 percent combined State, MCTD and county\ntax rate). Although Mr. Jones was a resident of New York State and Yonkers at\nthe time of purchase, at this time Mr. Jones does not owe an additional\ncompensating use tax since the horse was not entered in racing events on more\nthan five days in this locality. The additional tax at the 1/4 percent rate for\nthe Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District is due after the horse is\nentered into a racing event at Yonkers Raceway for the fifth day, since the\nhorse having entered one race at Roosevelt Raceway, will have at that time\nentered into racing events on more than five days within such district. Only\nafter the horse is entered into a racing event at Yonkers Raceway for the sixth\nday will Mr. Jones owe an additional compensating use tax of 4 percent for the\nlocal tax rate in effect in that jurisdiction. (3)\n\nThe lease of a racehorse is considered to\nbe a taxable transaction. Thus, where a racehorse leased outside New York State\nis subsequently entered into racing events in New York State on more than five\ndays in any one calendar year by a resident lessee, a compensating use tax\nbecomes due on the amount of any lease payments required to be paid by the\nlessee to the lessor in respect of any lease period or portion thereof during\nwhich the horse was thereafter present in New York State. (4)\n\nWhen a horse breeder transfers ownership\nof a racehorse and later reacquires the same horse, the reacquisition is\nconsidered a purchase. If reacquisition and delivery of the racehorse take\nplace outside of New York State and subsequently the horse is entered into\nracing events in New York State on more than five days in any one calendar\nyear, a compensating use tax is due on the first $100,000 of value of the\nracehorse if the breeder was a resident at the time of a\nreacquisition. (5)\n\nThe trading of\nracehorses is a sale transaction potentially subject to the sales and/or\ncompensating use tax for each party in the trade. When the trading of\nracehorses occurs outside of New York State, a party to the trade will be\nliable for the compensating use tax based on the current market value of the\nhorse given up plus any other consideration which may have been paid or given\n(the taxable amount of such sum not to exceed $100,000) if the party was a\nresident at the time of the trade and if the horse acquired is subsequently\nentered into racing events in New York State on more than five days in any one\ncalendar year. (e) Reciprocity. (1)\n\nWhen a person\npays sales and/or use taxes to another state or jurisdiction within such state\non the purchase or use of a racehorse and subsequently brings the horse into\n\nNew York State, the use of which becomes subject to the New York State and/or\nlocal compensating use taxes, the purchaser may claim a credit for the other\nstate and/or local tax paid. Such credit may not exceed the New York State\nand/or local compensating use taxes due. (2)\n\nThe credit for the other state and/or\nlocal tax paid is allowed only where: (i) such\ntax was legally due and paid to the other state or jurisdiction without and\nright to a refund or credit thereof; and\n(ii)\na similar credit is allowed by the other\nstate for the New York State and local sales and compensating use taxes paid\nunder similar circumstances. (3)\n\nThe credit for the tax is computed based\nupon the rate of tax paid to the other state and/or locality and the rate of\ntax to be paid to New York State and/or local jurisdictions within New York\n\nState, not on the dollar amount of tax paid. The claim for credit is allowed\nonly to the extent the rate used to determine the tax paid to the other state\nand/or locality does not exceed the New York State and local compensating use\ntax rate used to determine the tax due New York State and its local\njurisdictions. Example 13: A person engaged in racing activities in Saratoga purchases\na racehorse in another state and pays sales tax at the rate of five percent to\nthe other state on the purchase price of $200,000 for a total tax paid of\n$10,000. The other state's law has a reciprocal provision allowing a credit for\n\nNew York State and/or local taxes paid similar to the credit allowed under New\n\nYork State law. Subsequently, within six months, the person transports the\nhorse into New York State and enters the horse in racing events at Saratoga\nwhich is a taxing jurisdiction that has an effective New York State and local\nsales and use tax rate of seven percent. Upon the horse being entered in racing\nevents in Saratoga on more than five days in the same calendar year, a\ncompensating use tax becomes due at the tax rate of seven percent on $100,000\n(the maximum taxable amount in this transaction) resulting in use tax due in\nthe amount of $7,000. The person is entitled to claim a credit of $5,000\n($100,000 × 5 percent) against the $7,000 use tax due, thereby reducing the\namount of use tax owed to $2,000. The remaining $5,000 tax paid to the other\nstate as a result of the higher tax base is not allowed to be used as a credit\nagainst the use tax due within New York State. Example 14: Assume the same facts as Example 13 except $70,000 was paid\nfor the purchase of the racehorse. In such a case, the person can claim the\ntotal $3,500 tax paid to the other state ($70,000 × 5 percent) as a credit\nagainst the New York State and local compensating use taxes due of $4,900\n($70,000 × 7 percent), leaving New York State and local use taxes due of\n$1,400. Example 15: A person engaged in racing activities in New York State\npurchases a racehorse in another state and pays the sales tax at the five\npercent rate in effect in the other state on a purchase price of $70,000 for a\ntotal tax paid of $3,500. The five percent tax rate in that other state\nincludes a three percent state tax rate and a two percent local tax rate. The\nother state has a reciprocal provision which allows a credit for the New York\n\nState sales and use tax but does not allow credit for the sales and use tax\nimposed in the local taxing jurisdictions in New York State. The New York State\nand local use tax due is $4,900 ($70,000 × 7 percent) less a credit for the\nother state tax paid of $2,100 ($70,000 × 3 percent), resulting in a New York\n\nState and local use tax owed in the amount of $2,800. No credit is allowed for\nthe local tax paid to the other state since such state does not allow a similar\ncredit for New York's local sales and use taxes. Cross-reference: For definition of resident, see paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (f) Nontaxable transactions. (1)\n\nPurchases of racehorses within New York\n\nState by residents or nonresidents of New York State are not subject to the\nsales tax when such horses are delivered to the purchaser outside of New York\nby the seller prior to the time the purchaser is deemed to have taken\npossession of the horse. (2)\n\nReceipts from the purchase of a racehorse outside of New York State by a person\nwho was a nonresident of New York State at the time of such purchase are not\nsubject to the compensating use tax when such person subsequently brings the\nracehorse into New York State for racing purposes or any other use. Cross-reference: For definition of resident, see paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (3)\nA racehorse raced in New York State by\nits breeder (regardless of whether such person is a resident) is not subject to\nthe sales or compensating use tax, provided the breeder had not transferred\nownership of the horse and at a later date reacquired the same horse. (4)\n\nThe purchase of a racehorse by a resident\nof New York State is not subject to the sales or compensating use tax if\npurchased outside of New York State and never brought into New York\n\nState. (5)\n\nThe syndication of a\nracehorse where the horse is purchased exclusively for breeding purposes is\nexempt from the sales or compensating use tax. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
