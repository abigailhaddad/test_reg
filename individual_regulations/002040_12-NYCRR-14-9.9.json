  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.9 - Valve capacity\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The minimum safety valve or safety relief valve relieving capacity for other\nthan electric boilers, waste heat boilers, organic fluid vaporizer generators, and forced-flow steam generators with no fixed steam and waterline, when\nprovided in accordance with section\n14-9.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart shall be determined on the basis of the pounds of steam generated per\nhour per square foot of boiler heating surface and waterwall heating surface, as given in the following table: Minimum pounds\nof steam per hour per square foot of surface\n\nBoiler heating\nsurface\n\nHand-fired\n\nStoker-fired\n\nOil, gas, or\npulverized-fuel-fired\n\nHand-fired\n\nStoker-fired\n\nOil, gas, or\npulverized-fuel-fired\n\nFire-tube boilers\n5\n7\n8\n8\n10\n14\n\nWater-tube boilers\n6\n8\n10\n8\n12\n16\n\nNote: When a boiler\nis fired only by a gas having a heat value not in excess of 200 Btu per cubic\nfoot, the minimum safety valve relieving capacity may be based on the values\ngiven for hand-fired boilers above. (1)\n\nThe\nrequired steam relieving capacity in lb/hr of the safety relief valves on a\nhigh-temperature water boiler shall be determined by dividing the maximum\noutput in Btu/hr at the boiler nozzle obtained by the firing of any fuel for\nwhich the unit is designed, by 1000. (2)\n\nAny economizer which may be shut off from\nthe boiler, thereby permitting the economizer to become a fired pressure\nvessel, shall have one or more safety relief valves with a total discharge\ncapacity, calculated from the maximum expected heat absorption in Btu/hr, as\ndetermined by the manufacturer, divided by 1000. This absorption shall be\nstated in the stamping. (3)\n\nThe\nrequired relieving capacity in pounds per hour of the safety or safety relief\nvalves on a waste heat boiler shall be determined by the manufacturer. When\nauxiliary firing is to be used in combination with waste heat recovery, the\nmaximum output shall include the effect of such firing in the total required\ncapacity. When auxiliary firing is to be used in place of waste heat recovery, the required relieving capacity shall be based on auxiliary firing or waste\nheat recovery, whichever is higher. (4)\n\nThe minimum safety valve or safety relief\nvalve relieving capacity for electric boilers shall be 31/2 lb/hr/kw\ninput. (5)\n\nOrganic fluid vaporizer\ngenerators require special consideration as given in the ASME Code. (b) In many cases a greater\nrelieving capacity of safety valves will have to be provided than the minimum\nspecified by this Subpart and in every case the requirements of this section\nshall be met. (c) The heating\nsurface shall be computed as follows: Heating surface, as part of a circulating\nsystem in contact on one side with water or wet steam being heated and on the\nother side with gas or refractory being cooled, shall be measured on the side\nreceiving heat. Boiler heating surface and other equivalent surface outside the\nfurnace shall be measured circumferentially plus any extended surface. Waterwall heating surface and other equivalent surface within the furnace shall\nbe measured as the projected tube area (diameter * length) plus any extended\nsurface on the furnace side. In computing the heating surface for this purpose, only the tubes, fireboxes, shells, tubesheets, and the projected area headers\nneed be considered, except that for vertical firetube steam boilers, only that\nportion of the tube surface up to the middle gage cock is to be computed. The\nminimum number and size of safety valves required shall be determined on the\nbasis of the aggregate relieving capacity and the relieving capacity marked on\nthe valves by the manufacturer. Where the operating conditions are changed, or\nadditional heating surface such as water screens or waterwalls is connected to\nthe boiler circulation, the safety valve capacity shall be increased, if\nnecessary, to meet the new conditions. The additional valves required on\naccount of changed conditions may be installed at the boiler outlet or on the\nsteam line between the boiler and the main stop valve except when the boiler is\nequipped with a superheater or other piece of apparatus, in which case they may\nbe installed on the steam pipes between the boiler drum and the inlet to the\nsuperheater or other apparatus, provided that the steam main between the boiler\nand points where a safety valve or valves may be attached has a cross-sectional\narea at least three times the combined areas of the inlet connections to the\nsafety valves applied to it. (d) If\nthe valve capacity cannot be computed or if it is desirable to prove the\ncomputations, it may be checked in any one of the three following ways, and if\nfound insufficient, additional capacity shall be provided: (1)\n\nBy making an accumulation test, that is, by shutting off all other steam-discharge outlets from the boiler and forcing\nthe fires to the maximum. The safety valve equipment shall be sufficient to\nprevent an excess pressure beyond that specified in section\n14-9.9\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart. This method should not be used on a boiler with a superheater or\nreheater or on a high-temperature water boiler. (2)\n\nBy measuring the maximum amount of fuel\nthat can be burned and computing the corresponding evaporative capacity upon\nthe basis of the heating value of the fuel (see section\n14-9.9\n[a]\nof this\n\nSubpart). (3)\n\nBy determining the\nmaximum evaporative capacity by measuring the feedwater. The sum of the safety\nvalve capacities marked on the valves shall be equal to or greater than the\nmaximum evaporative capacity of the boiler. This method shall not be used on\nhigh-temperature water boilers. (e) The valve capacity for each boiler shall\nbe such that the valve or valves will discharge all the pressure that can be\ngenerated by the boiler without allowing the pressure to rise more than six\npercent above the highest pressure at which any valve is set and in no case to\nmore than six percent above the maximum allowable working pressure. The maximum\ncapacity of a boiler shall be determined by the manufacturer and shall be based\non the capacity of the fuel-burning equipment, on the air supply, draft, etc. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
