  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 16.5 - Restrictions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Personalized plates. 1. No person has a right\nto a particular personalized plate. Personalized plates are issued by DMV in\nthe sole discretion of the commissioner. 2. Personalized plates bearing a plate number\nthat represents a word, phrase, expression, or that has a meaning, connotation\nor format that the commissioner deems objectionable shall not be issued. Such\nplates shall include, but need not be limited to, those that the commissioner\ndetermines: (i) Are obscene, profane, vulgar, repulsive, depraved, or lewd; (ii)\n\nDescribe or refer to a sexual or intimate body part, area or function; (iii)\n\nDescribe or refer to\neliminatory or other bodily functions; (iv)\n\nAre derogatory, contemptuous, degrading, disrespectful or inflammatory; (v) Express, describe, advertise, advocate, promote, encourage, glorify, or condone\nviolence, crime or unlawful conduct; (vi)\n\nDescribe, connote, or refer to illegal\ndrug(s), controlled substance(s) or related paraphernalia; (vii)\n\nMay constitute copyright infringement, or infringement of a trademark, trade name, service mark, or patent; (viii)\n\nRefer to, suggest, or may appear to\nrefer to or to suggest any governmental or law enforcement purpose, function or\nentity; (ix)\n\nDo not have at least\none letter, consist of six numbers followed by one letter, or may be misleading\nor confusing in identifying a plate number (e.g., the substitution of the\nnumeral zero for the letter \"O\") or\n(x) Are reserved for issuance to specific\nclasses of vehicles other than passenger vehicles (e.g., plates assigned to\ncounty clerks, members of certain professions, historic motor vehicles, etc.). 3. Personalized plates\nthat the commissioner may deem to be objectionable shall include plates bearing\na combination of letters or numerals that in any language, or by means of a\nslang term, abbreviation, phonetic spelling or mirror image, in the judgment of\nthe commissioner, forms a word, phrase, or expression, or has a meaning or\nconnotation listed in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. 4. The commissioner may determine at any time\nthat a personalized plate is objectionable, regardless of whether the plate is\nrequested, approved but not yet issued, or issued. If, after the commissioner\nreceives a request for a personalized plate, the commissioner deems the\nrequested plate to be objectionable, the commissioner shall deny the\napplicant's request. In such cases, the applicant shall be deemed to have\nconsented to withdraw the application for the personalized plate. If, after the\nissuance of a personalized plate, the commissioner deems the issued plate to be\nobjectionable, the commissioner shall invalidate the plate. The registrant will\nbe required to remove the invalidated plate from the registered vehicle and\nwill be issued a standard registration plate. When the commissioner either\nwithdraws approval for a requested personalized plate or invalidates an issued\npersonalized plate, the registrant may select a nonobjectionable personalized\nplate or a non-personalized plate at no additional cost. (b) Reserved Series. (1)\n\nNo person, organization or other entity\nhas a right to a requested reserved series. Reserved series are issued by DMV\nin the sole discretion of the commissioner. (2)\n\nReserved series bearing a message, image\nor other mark that has a meaning, connotation or format that the commissioner\ndeems objectionable shall not be issued. Such series shall include, but not be\nlimited to, those that the commissioner determines are described within\nsubparagraphs (i) through (viii) of paragraph (2) of subdivision two of this\nsection. (3)\n\nThe commissioner shall\nissue an acceptable reserved series upon the applicant's delivery to the\n\nDepartment of: (a) a bond in a form\nacceptable to the Department, executed by a surety company authorized by the\n\nNew York State Department of Financial Services to transact business in the\nstate, in the amount of $6,000; or, (b) at least 200 non-refundable, pre-paid\norders for the proposed plates in the reserved series; Such delivery shall\ncover the Department's development costs for the design and production of the\napproved reserve series. If 200 or more plate orders are received within the\ntwo years following the date on which plates in the reserved series are first\navailable for sale, then the commissioner shall not seek to recover against the\nbond. If fewer than 200 plate orders are received within such time, the\ncommissioner shall be entitled to recover against the bond in an amount\nproportionate to such shortfall. Any such action against a bond shall be made\nby crediting the applicant with the service charge prescribed by sections\n404\nor\n411-a\nof Vehicle and Traffic Law for each plate order timely received within the\napplicant's reserved series. This paragraph shall not apply to any plates in a\nproposed series reserved for employees or members of a governmental agency or\nbody where such series cannot be issued to more than 200 individuals because of\nthe criteria established for eligibility for a plate in such series (e.g., plates issued to members of the New York State Court of Appeals). (4)\n\nThe commissioner may determine\nat any time that a plate in a reserved series, or a series itself, is\nobjectionable, regardless of whether the plate is requested, approved but not\nyet issued, or issued. If, after the commissioner receives a request for such a\nplate or plates, the commissioner deems the requested plate or plates to be\nobjectionable, the commissioner shall invalidate such plate or plates. If such\nplate or plates have already been issued, the registrant will be required to\nremove the invalidated plate from the registered vehicle and will be issued a\nstandard registration plate at no additional cost. (c) In making any determination under this\nsection, the commissioner shall rely upon the reasonably objective meaning of a\nproposed plate combination or reserved series and shall not consider or inquire\nof the applicant's subjective intent.
