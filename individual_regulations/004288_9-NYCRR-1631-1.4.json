  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1631-1.4 - Fire prevention campaigns\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tenant programs. Fire Prevention Week, which is proclaimed each year during the\nmonth of October, and the Christmas season are two periods when authorities\nshould take special efforts to make all tenants aware of their obligations to\nprevent fires. Programs should be developed to inform tenants of precautions to\ntake. During Fire Prevention Week, such programs can be made more effective by\ncoordinating them with those of the local fire department. As a minimum for\nsuch programs, notices should be sent to all tenants prior to Fire Prevention\n\nWeek and prior to the Christmas season stressing the following points: (1)\n\nEvery member of the family should know\nthe escape route(s) to be followed in case of fire. (2)\n\nNever leave children alone without adult\nsupervision. (3)\n\nKeep matches out\nof reach of children. (4)\n\nBe\ncareful with cigarettes. NEVER SMOKE IN BED. Don't smoke when looking through\nclosets or other storage areas. Place cigarettes on ash trays so that they can\nnot fall off tray if they are forgotten. (5)\n\nReplace worn or frayed cords on electric\nlamps or other portable devices. (6)\n\nDo not run fixtures or other extension\ncords under carpeting. Constant foot traffic may fray insulation and cause\nfire. (7)\n\nElectric heating\nequipment such as irons, toasters, etc. should be rested on insulated bases and\nclear of any flammable material above, such as wood shelf, curtains, decorations. (8)\n\nTelevision sets\nshould never be placed on radiators or in confined cubicles which restrict\ncirculation of air. Never leave set unattended when turned on. (9)\n\nDo not use naptha, gasoline or other\nflammable fluids for cleaning. (10)\n\nDo not park in fire lanes or other restricted areas. Note:The following items should be stressed in the\n\nChristmas season notice, together with a reference to items (2), (3) and (4)\nabove for year round observance: (11)\n\nSet Christmas tree in water to keep it\nfrom drying out. (12)\n\nUse only\nelectric light sets and electric candles. Make certain cords and sockets are in\ngood condition and that sets have Underwriters' Label of Approval. (13)\n\nUse only flameproof material for snow\nunder tree or for decorations. (14)\n\nDo not operate electric trains or other electrical toys under tree. (15)\n\nKeep light bulbs away from tree needles\nas heat from bulb may ignite them. (16)\n\nDo not leave tree lights burning when no\nadult is present in apartment. (17)\n\nCurtains and other inflammable materials must be kept at least six inches from\nelectric candles placed in windows. (18)\n\nPlace tree in apartment so as not to\nblock exit in event tree catches on fire. Note:Notices for both Fire Prevention Week and\n\nChristmas season should stress need for knowing how and where to place an\nalarm. Such notices should stress that in event of Fire or Suspicion of\n\nFire: (19)\n\nGet everybody, especially children, out. (20)\n\nGet\nyourself out and close door of apartment after you to prevent spread of fire, gases and smoke. (21)\n\nGive alarm!\nTelephone fire department, or pull fire alarm box if available, or use any\nother means of giving the alarm. (b) Management action. During the Christmas\nholiday, an excessive amount of discarded paper and cardboard boxes, in\naddition to the usual accumulation, occurs without the usual trash collections. Every effort should be made to dispose of this fire hazard by prompt\nincineration or temporary storage in a safe place. Incinerator rooms and\ngarbage stations should be thoroughly cleared of all refuse prior to the\nholiday. A safe area should be set aside for the disposal of Christmas trees\nand tenants notified. (c) Cooperation with local fire department. (1)\n\nLocal authorities should work closely with their local fire departments on fire\nprevention matters. Before initial occupancy, a plan of the project showing\nstreet numbers, building references and other information useful to the fire\ndepartment should be given to the area firehouse. The services of the fire\ndepartment's inspection unit should be utilized at periodic\nintervals. (2)\n\nSnow removal plans, especially for heavy snowfalls, should assign the highest priority to clearing\nof fire hydrants and fire lanes. Cooperation of tenants whose apartments are\nnear fire hydrants should be sought for digging out such hydrants if heavy\nsnowfall occurs during a weekend. Means of quickly locating fire hydrants\ncovered by heavy snowfall should be devised if considered necessary. Markers\napproximately four feet tall can be erected alongside hydrants in such a way as\nnot to interfere with opening of hydrant. Unobtrusive signs or other means of\nindication showing direct line distance to hydrants, gas shut off valves, etc. can be placed at eye-level height on walls of buildings which are close to such\nhydrants or valves. The officers of the area firehouse can be invited\nperiodically, perhaps during Fire Prevention Week, to visit the project and\nreacquaint themselves with the locations of such hydrants and valves. Also, the\nmaintenance staff should be familiar with the location of such valves and\nhydrants. A framed, glass covered map should be placed in the maintenance shop\nshowing locations of various valves and similar information. (3)\n\nFire extinguishers should be placed at\nstrategic locations. The type of extinguisher will be determined by the nature\nof the exposure. Fire extinguishers should be checked or tested at periodic\nintervals as recommended by manufacturer. Such tests which require the\ndischarge of extinguishers offer opportunities to demonstrate to tenant and\nemployee groups, the proper use of extinguishers. Where possible, demonstrations should include actual handling of extinguishers by individuals\nin the groups so that they may become familiar with their operation. Local fire\ndepartments are usually able and willing to assist in such\ndemonstrations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
