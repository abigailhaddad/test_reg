  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 938.2 - Definitions. For purposes of this Part\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Affiliate Relationship shall mean: (1)\n\nTwo or more persons whom the Client Filer\nhas actual knowledge live in the same household. (2)\n\nTwo or more corporations, partnerships, organizations, or other entities that the Client Filer has actual knowledge or\nreason to know have any of the following relationships: parent/subsidiary; subsidiaries with the same corporate parent; national or regional organization\nand their local chapter(s); local chapters of the same national or regional\norganization. (3)\nA sole\nproprietorship and its sole proprietor if the Client Filer knows or has reason\nto know of the relationship. (4)\n\nWhether a Client Filer has \"reason to know\" of the relationships listed in\nparagraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision is based on an examination of the\ntotality of the facts and circumstances. If a reasonable person, looking at the\nall the facts and circumstances, would conclude that a Client Filer should know\nof the existence of one or more these relationships, then the \"reason to know\"\nstandard has been satisfied. (b) Client Filer shall mean: (1)\nA Beneficial Client, as defined in\nsection 3 of Part 943 of this Title, other than a Public Corporation; or\n(2)\n\nAny lobbyist registered\npursuant to Legislative Law § 1-e whose lobbying activity is performed on\nits own behalf and not pursuant to retention by a client. (Such a lobbyist is\nconsidered its own client for reporting purposes.)\n(c) Client Semi-Annual Report shall mean the\nsemi-annual reports filed with the Commission pursuant to Legislative Law\n§ 1-j. (d) Coalition shall\nhave the meaning described in section 9 of Part 943 of this Title. (e) Contribution shall mean any payment to, or for the benefit of, the Client Filer and which is intended to fund, in whole\nor in part, the Client Filer's activities or operations. Contribution shall\ninclude equity investments in limited liability companies, general\npartnerships, and corporations; provided, however, Contribution shall not\ninclude publicly traded stocks or shares. Contribution shall not mean: (i) a payment in exchange for goods or\nservices rendered or delivered directly to the individual or entity making the\npayment; and\n(ii)\na payment that: (a) is earmarked and conditioned by the payor\nsuch that it may only be used for a specific purpose other than lobbying\nactivity in New York; and\n(b) is\nmaintained in a segregated bank account solely for the specific purpose and\nunavailable for general operating expenses. For example, an organization that\nmaintains a separate segregated bank account for a lobbying initiative in\n\nCalifornia need not report a payment earmarked by the payor for this\ninitiative, provided however, that funds from this account may not be used for\noperating expenses or any other reason other than the California initiative. (1)\n\nRecords of such payments must be retained\nfor a period of three years and may be requested by the Commission to verify\nqualification for this exclusion. (2)\n\nTo qualify for the exclusion in\nsubparagraph (ii) above, it is not sufficient for a payor to restrict a payment\nfrom being used for lobbying in New York; the payor must earmark the payment\nfor the specific purpose stated in\n(ii)(a). (f) Expenditure Threshold consists of the\nfollowing two requirements: (1)\n\nThe Client\n\nFiler has spent in excess of $15,000 in Reportable Compensation and/or Expenses\nfor lobbying in New York State during the Expenditure Threshold Period; and\n(2)\n\nThe Client Filer's\n\nReportable Compensation and Expenses constitute at least 3% of the Client\n\nFiler's Total Expenditures during the Expenditure Threshold Period. A Client Filer who is a member of a Coalition must include\nall amounts it has contributed to the Coalition when determining whether such\n\nClient Filer has exceeded the Expenditure Threshold. (g) Expenditure Threshold Period\nis determined according to the following: (1)\n\nTwelve-Month Calculation: the 12-month period preceding and including the last\nday of the applicable client semi-annual reporting period. (2)\n\nCalendar-Year Calculation: January 1st to\nthe last day of the applicable client semiannual reporting period. Any Client Filer that does not meet the Expenditure Threshold\nusing the Twelve-Month Calculation must then determine whether it has met the\n\nExpenditure Threshold using the Calendar-Year Calculation, and if it has, then\nthe Client Filer is deemed to have met the statutory Expenditure Threshold. To\nillustrate for the 2016 Client Semi-Annual Reports: Client Semi-Annual Filing Date\n\nTwelve-Month Calculation Dates\n\nCalendar Year Calculation Dates\n\nJanuary 15, 2016 (covering\n\nJuly 1, 2015 - December 31, 2015)\n\nJanuary 1, 2015 - December 31, 2015\n\nJanuary 1, 2015 - December 31, 2015\n\nJuly 15, 2016 (covering January 1, 2016 - June 30, 2016)\n\nJuly 1, 2015 - June 30, 2016\n\nJanuary 1, 2016 - June 30, 2016\n(h) Reportable Amount of Contribution(s)\nshall mean, for each Contribution not specifically designated for lobbying in\n\nNew York, the product of: (1)\nthe dollar\namount of the Contribution; and\n(2)\n\nReportable Compensation and Expenses divided by Total Expenditures.

(2)\n\nExpenses: (i) For any Client Filer who lobbies on its\nown behalf, the term \"expenses\" shall have the same meaning as in Legislative\n\nLaw § 1-c(g), i.e., any expenditures incurred by or reimbursed to the\nemployed or designated lobbyist for lobbying but shall not include\ncontributions reportable pursuant to article fourteen of the election\nlaw. (ii)\n\nFor all other Client\n\nFilers, the term \"expenses\" shall mean any expenditure reimbursed to the\nlobbyist for lobbying, but shall not include contributions reportable pursuant\nto article fourteen of the Election Law.

(l) Source\nof Funding Disclosure shall mean the section within the Client Semi-Annual\n\nReport completed by Client Filers who serve only as a Beneficial Client and, thus, are only responsible for the source of funding disclosure section of the\n\nClient Semi-Annual Report, as prescribed by subsection\n943.9\n(h) of this\n\nTitle. (m) Total Expenditures shall\nmean the sum of any and all payments of cash or cash equivalents made in the\nordinary course of business, or a charge against available funds in settlement\nof an obligation made in the ordinary course of business.
