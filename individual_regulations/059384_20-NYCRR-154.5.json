Tit. 20 § 154.5 - New York taxable income, New York personal service taxable income and New York State minimum taxable income of an individual or of a trust for resident and nonresident periods-general rules\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 654(b), (g) and 603-A\n(a) Individual. (1)\n\nThe New York taxable income for the\nportion of the taxable year during which an individual was a resident must be\ndetermined, except for the special accruals required by section\n154.10\nof this\n\nPart, under Article 2 of this Subchapter, as if such individual's taxable year\nfor Federal income tax purposes were limited to the period of resident status. The New York taxable income for the remaining portion of the taxable year\nduring which such individual was a nonresident must be determined, under\n\nArticle 3 of this Subchapter, as if such individual's taxable year for Federal\nincome tax purposes were limited to the period of nonresident status, subject\nto the provisions regarding special accruals set forth in sections\n154.10\nand\n154.11\nof this Part. (2)\n(i) In determining the New York taxable\nincome of an individual for such individual's respective periods of residence\nand nonresidence, annual limitations with respect to specific items of income, gain, loss and deduction such as dividend exclusions, capital losses, medical\nexpenses, contributions, casualty and theft losses, etc., applicable for\n\nFederal income tax purposes, are to be applied separately to the applicable\n\nFederal items attributable to the separate periods covered by the New York\n\nState resident and nonresident personal income tax returns required under this\n\nPart. Example: A husband and wife filed a joint Federal income tax\nreturn for the calendar year 1985 showing Federal adjusted gross income of\n$20,000, all from New York State sources. They were residents of New York State\nfrom January 1, 1985 through June 30, 1985, and became nonresidents on July 1, 1985. They elected to file joint New York State resident and nonresident\npersonal income tax returns for their respective periods of residence and\nnonresidence, properly reporting $10,000 on each New York State personal income\ntax return. They itemized their deductions for Federal income tax purposes and\nthey also elected to itemize their deductions for New York State personal\nincome tax purposes. The taxpayers incurred and paid medical expenses of $1,950\nduring the taxable year and computed an allowable Federal medical deduction of\n$950 determined in the following manner: Prescription medicines and drugs\n$ 400\n\nOther medical expenses (including doctors, hospitals, medical insurance premiums, etc.). 1,550\n\nTotal\n$1,950\n\nLess 5% of Federal adjusted gross income (5% of\n$20,000)\n1,000\n\nFederal medical expense deduction\n$ 950\n\nAssuming that the medical expenses shown in the\nfollowing computation represent the amounts of those medical expenses incurred\nduring the respective periods of residence and nonresidence, there would be no\nallowable medical deduction to claim on the New York State resident personal\nincome tax return and the allowable medical deduction to claim on the New York\n\nState nonresident personal income tax return would be $1,025: Resident\nreturn\n\nNonresident\nreturn\n\nMedical expenses incurred: Prescription medicines\nand drugs\n$ 75\n$ 325\n\nOther medical expenses (including doctors, hospitals, medical insurance premiums, etc). 350\n1,200\n\nTotal\n$ 425\n$1,525\n\nLess 5% of Federal adjusted gross income\n500\n500\n\nNew York State medical deduction allowed\n-0\n$1,025\n(ii)\n\nFurther, in determining the New York\ntaxable income of an individual for such individual's respective periods of\nresidence and nonresidence, the annual limitation with respect to the pension\nand annuity income modification allowed by section\n612 (c)(3-a)\nof the Tax Law\n(see section\n112.3\n[c][2]\nof this Title) is to be applied separately to the separate periods covered by\nthe New York State resident and nonresident personal income tax returns\nrequired under this Part. No proration of the annual limitation based on the\nperiod of time covered by each New York State personal income tax return is\nrequired to be made. (3)\n\nThe New York personal service taxable income for the portion of the taxable\nyear during which an individual was a resident must be determined in accordance\nwith the provisions of section 603-A of the Tax Law applicable to a resident\nindividual, as if such individual's taxable year for Federal income tax\npurposes were limited to the period of resident status. The amount of each item\nentering into the computation of New York personal service taxable income of\nsuch taxpayer for the period of residence must also be determined in accordance\nwith the provisions of this Part which apply to such items for the period of\nresidence. The New York personal service taxable income for the remaining\nportion of the taxable year during which the individual was a nonresident must\nbe determined in accordance with the provisions of section 603-A of the Tax Law\napplicable to a nonresident individual, as if such individual's taxable year\nfor Federal income tax purposes were limited to the period of nonresident\nstatus. The amount of each item entering into the computation of New York\npersonal service taxable income for the period of nonresidence must also be\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions of this Part which apply to such\nitems for the period of nonresidence. (4)\n\nThe New York State minimum taxable income\nfor the portion of the year during which an individual was a resident is\ndetermined, except for the special accruals required by section\n154.10\nof this\n\nPart, under Part 122 of this Title, as if such individual's taxable year for\n\nFederal income tax purposes were limited to the period of resident status.

(5)\n\nIn determining\nthe New York State minimum taxable income of an individual for such\nindividual's respective periods of residence and nonresidence, the specific\ndeduction allowed for each such period is the same as allowed by Parts 122 and\n141 of this Title. No proration of the specific deduction based on the period\nof time covered by each New York State personal income tax return is required\nto be made. Furthermore, in determining the New York State personal income tax\napplicable to the resident and nonresident periods in arriving at New York\n\nState minimum taxable income for each such period (see sections\n122.1\n[b][2]\nand\n141.1\n[b][2]\nof this Title), the New York State personal income tax on the combined New York\ntaxable income or New York personal service taxable income for each period, minus the credits referred to in section\n122.1\n(b)(2)\nand section\n141.1\n(b)(2), is to be apportioned on forms IT-220 filed for the separate periods in the\nratio that the separately computed New York State personal income tax for the\nparticular period, minus the credits referred to in section\n122.1\n(b)(2)\nand section\n141.1\n(b)(2)\napplicable to that particular period, is to the total of such separately\ncomputed New York State personal income taxes on the separate New York State\npersonal income tax returns. The following example illustrates the application\nof the provisions of this paragraph (assume the taxable year is the calendar\nyear 1979 and the taxpayer did not have any New York personal service taxable\nincome). New York taxable\nincome\n\nNew York State personal income\ntax\n\nResident personal income tax return\n$50,000\n$5,560\n\nNonresident personal income tax return\n10,000\n450\n\nTotal of separate New York State personal income\ntaxes\n$6,010\n\nCombined New York taxable income\n$60,000\n\nNew York State personal income tax on combined\n\nNew York taxable income\n$6,960\n\nApportionment of New York State\npersonal income tax for New York State minimum\nincome tax purposes on forms IT-220 for the\nresident\nand nonresident periods: Resident period: $5,560\n/\n$6,010\n× $6,960 = $6,438.87\n\nNonresident period: $\n450\n/\n$6,010\n× $6,960 =\n$521.13\n(b) Trust.
