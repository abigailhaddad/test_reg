  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-3.2 - State Housing Debt Fund\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe State Housing Debt Fund is used by the Comptroller\nas a debt service fund to receive remittance for debt service on bond issues\nfrom local agencies and to make payments of interest and amortization to\nbondholders. Under the terms of the various contracts for State aid, local\nagencies are required to make payments of interest and amortization on their\nindebtedness to the State in such amounts and at such times as will enable the\n\nComptroller to meet the debt service on the State's housing bonds. The\ncontracts further provide that remittances for debt service must be in the\nhands of the Comptroller at least 15 days in advance of the date that payment\nis due by the State to the bondholders. Interest on the bonds is, ordinarily, payable semiannually and amortization is payable annually, the amortization\npayment date coinciding with an interest payment date. The division will\nendeavor to give the local agency timely notice, but the primary responsibility\nfor living up to the terms of the contract and meeting the debt service on time\nis the local agency's. Remittances for debt service on bonds will be made by\nthe local agency to the division, for transmittal to the Comptroller, and not\nto the Comptroller direct. Checks for debt service on bond issues should be\nmade payable to \"Comptroller--State of New York\". The Comptroller may also pay\ninto the State Housing Debt Fund the premiums, if any, received on the sale of\nhousing bonds and the interest received on State Housing Fund\ninvestments. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1644-3.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
