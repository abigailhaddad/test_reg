  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 146-2.20 - Tips charged on credit cards\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen tips are charged on credit cards, an employer is not\nrequired to pay the employee's pro-rated share of the service charge taken by\nthe credit card company for the processing of the tip. The employer must return\nto the employee the full amount of the tip charged on the credit card, minus\nthe pro-rated portion of the tip taken by the credit card company. Example\n\nThe bill totals $100 exactly. The customer leaves, on\ntheir credit card, the $100 payment of the bill, as well as a $20 tip. Both the\ntip and the bill must be processed through a credit card company which charges\na 5 percent fee on all transactions. The total charge levied by the credit card\ncompany on the $120 charge is $6. Of that $6, $5 is for the bill (5 percent of\n$100) and $1 is for the tip (5 percent of $20). The employer must provide the\nemployee $19, which represents the $20 tip minus $1 pro-rated employee's\nportion of the surcharge). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
