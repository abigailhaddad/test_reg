The unit of certification shall be a field, but a portion\nof the field may be approved for certification, provided the remainder is\ndesignated specifically, harvested separately and the seed is eliminated from\ncertification. (2)\n\nIsolation\nrequirement. A specific commercial hybrid to be inspected for\ncertification must be so located that the ear parent is not less than 40 rods\nfrom other corn, provided; however, that the distance may be modified, depending on the acreage of the specific cross by the planting of border rows\nof pollen parent and except also as shown in subdivision (b), (1) and (2)\nbelow. The following table applies to all sides of the specific cross exposed\nto contamination from other corn, whether located directly opposite or\ndiagonally, and indicates the minimum number of border rows required for fields\nof various sizes when located at different distances from the contaminating\ncorn: When the number of\nacres in the crossing field is: 9 or less\n10-14\n15-19\n20-24\n25-29\n30-34\n35-39\n40 or over\n\nThen at least this number of border\nrows is required\nand the distance of\nthe ear parent from other corn is at least\n\nRods\n\nRods\n\nRods\n\nRods\n\nRods\n\nRods\n\nRods\n\nRods\n40\n39\n38\n37\n36\n35\n34\n33\n1\n37.5\n36.5\n35.5\n34.5\n33.5\n32.5\n31.5\n30.5\n2\n35\n34\n33\n32\n31\n30\n29\n28\n3\n32.5\n31.5\n30.5\n29.5\n28.5\n27.5\n26.5\n25.5\n4\n30\n29\n28\n27\n26\n25\n24\n23\n5\n27.5\n26.5\n25.5\n24.5\n23.5\n22.5\n21.5\n20.5\n6\n25\n24\n23\n22\n21\n20\n19\n18\n7\n22.5\n21.5\n20.5\n19.5\n18.5\n17.5\n16.5\n15.5\n8\n20\n19\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\n9\n17.5\n16.5\n15.5\n14.5\n13.5\n12.5\n11.5\n10.5\n10\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n11\n12.5\n11.5\n10.5\n9.5\n8.5\n7.5\n6.5\n5.5\n12\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n13\n(b) Use of border rows to modify\nisolation requirements shall not apply: (1)\n\nFor corn where the contaminating field is\nsweet corn or of types other than that being grown for certification. (2)\n\nWhen differential maturity dates prevail\nand providing there are no receptive silks in the ear parent at the time pollen\nis being shed in the contaminating corn. (3)\n\nWhere natural barriers such as (i) woods\nintervene which are three rods or more in width and have sufficiently dense\nfoliage to prevent cross pollination and (ii) where a thick hedge row 20 feet\nor more in height intervenes plus 10 rows of pollen parent. (c) Detasseling. The following requirements apply only when five per cent or\nmore of the parent plants have apparently receptive silks. (1)\nA commercial hybrid will be disqualified\nfor certification if more than one per cent of the ear parent stalks have shed\npollen on any one inspection or if the total for three inspections on different\ndates exceeds two per cent. (2)\n\nSucker tassels, portions of tassels, or tassels on main plants will be counted\nas shedding pollen when two inches or more of the central stem, the side\nbranches or a combination of the two have the anthers extended from the\nglumes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n103.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
