The date of application filing for a resident of\na public institution who applies jointly for Supplemental Security Income and\nfood stamps as part of the Federal Social Security Administration's Pre-release\n\nProgram for the Institutionalized is the date the applicant is released from\nthe institution. (d) A social\nservices district must provide each household, at the time of application, with\na written statement explaining what action the household must take to cooperate\nwith the district in obtaining verification of appropriate information and\notherwise completing the application process. (e) Application procedures must be designed\nto identify each household eligible for expedited food stamp service at the\ntime the household requests assistance. Expedited service must be available to\nthe following households: (1)\nhouseholds with\nless than $150 in monthly gross income, provided their liquid resources do not\nexceed $100; (2)\nmigrant or\nseasonal farmworker households which are destitute households, as defined in\nsection\n387.1\n(k) of this\n\nPart, provided their liquid resources do not exceed $100; (3)\neligible households in which all members\nare homeless individuals as defined in section\n387.1\n(v) of this\n\nPart; and\n(4)\neligible households\nwhose combined monthly gross income and liquid resources are less than the\nhousehold's monthly rent or mortgage and utilities.

(h) (1)\n\nSocial services districts may request the applicant to complete a personal\nidentification number (PIN) selection form prior to determining the applicant's\neligibility for food stamps. However, the completion of the PIN selection form\nis not required in order for the social services district to determine the\napplicant's eligibility for food stamps. Social services districts must not\nwithhold or delay the determination of an applicant's eligibility because the\nPIN selection form has not been completed. (2)\n\nAfter a PIN code has been registered, the\nsocial services district must dispose of the PIN selection form in accordance\nwith department procedures. The social services district must not record the\nPIN code in the case record. Social services districts must not maintain a\nseparate file of PIN codes unless directed to do so by the\ndepartment. (i) As a\nresult of differences in public assistance and food stamp application\nprocessing procedures and timeliness standards, the local department may have\nto determine food stamp eligibility for expedited service prior to determining\neligibility for public assistance. (j) (1)\nA\nnonhousehold member may be designated as an authorized representative for\napplication processing purposes and/or to carry out household responsibilities\nduring the certification period, such as reporting changes in the household's\nincome or other household circumstances, only under the following conditions: (i) the authorized representative has been\ndesignated in writing by the head of household or spouse or another responsible\nmember of the household; and\n(ii)\nthe authorized representative is an adult who is sufficiently aware of relevant\nhousehold circumstances. (2)\n\nResidents of drug or alcohol treatment\ncenters must apply and be certified through the use of authorized\nrepresentatives. (3)\n\nThe\ndesignation of an authorized representative does not relieve the household of\nthe obligation to cooperate with all aspects of initial and continuing\neligibility for food stamp benefits and to provide timely and accurate\ninformation to the social services district. The household is liable for any\noverissuance of food stamp benefits that results from erroneous information\ngiven by the authorized representative. (k) Restrictions on designations of\nauthorized representatives. Social services districts must restrict the use of\nauthorized representatives for purposes of applying for and using food stamp\nbenefits as follows: (1)\n\nSocial services\ndistrict employees who are involved in the certification or issuance processes\nand retailers who are authorized to accept food stamp benefits may not act as\nauthorized representatives without the specific written approval of the local\nsocial services commissioner or his or her designee and only if that official\ndetermines that no one else is available to serve as an authorized\nrepresentative. (2)\n\nAn individual\ndisqualified for an intentional program violation cannot act as an authorized\nrepresentative during the disqualification period, unless the social services\ndistrict has determined that no one else is available to serve as an authorized\nrepresentative. The social services district must separately determine whether\nthe individual is needed to apply on behalf of the household or to use benefits\non behalf of the household. (3)\n\nIf\nthe social services district determines that an authorized representative has\nknowingly provided false information about household circumstances or has made\nimproper use of food stamp benefits, it may disqualify that person from being\nan authorized representative for up to one year. The social services district\nmust send written notification to the affected household(s) and the authorized\nrepresentative 30 days prior to the date of the disqualification. The\nnotification must specify the reason for the proposed action and the\nhousehold's right to a fair hearing. Drug and alcohol treatment centers and\nthose group homes which act as authorized representatives for their residents\nare not subject to disqualification under this paragraph. However, anyone, including drug and alcohol treatment centers and heads of group living\narrangements, that acts as an authorized representative and intentionally\nmisrepresents household circumstances is subject to disqualification for an\nintentional program violation or prosecution under applicable Federal and State\nstatutes and regulations for their actions. (4)\n\nHomeless meal providers may not act as\nauthorized representatives for homeless food stamp recipients. (5)\n\nIn order to prevent abuse of the program, a social services district may set a limit on the number of households an\nauthorized representative may represent at any given time and the total number\nof households an authorized representative may represent within a specific time\nperiod for purposes of applying for food stamp benefits and for reporting\nchanges in household circumstances during the certification period. The limit\non the number of households that an authorized representative may represent\nmust be applied equally to all authorized representatives in a district, but\ndoes not apply to drug and alcohol treatment centers, group homes and those who\nrepresent households only for purposes for using food stamp benefits. Prior to\nlimiting the number of households an authorized representative may represent, a\nsocial services district must request and obtain written approval from this\noffice. The request must state the number of households an authorized\nrepresentative may represent at any given time and the total number of\nhouseholds an authorized representative may represent within a specific time\nperiod.
