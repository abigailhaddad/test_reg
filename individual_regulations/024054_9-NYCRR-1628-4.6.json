  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1628-4.6 - Guarantees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Records of the\nexpiration dates of guarantees of a year or more will be maintained by project\noffice personnel. The project manager is responsible for making certain that\nsuch records are properly kept and ascertaining any possible guarantee\nobligations before authorizing repairs on guaranteed items. (b) Special note should be made of items\nwhich have a guarantee period and a warranty period of different\nduration. (c) Any notices or\ninformation as to the start of the guarantee period required by the\nmanufacturer should be forwarded to him as promptly as possible in accordance\nwith the terms of the guarantee. (d) Guarantees of short periods i.e., three\nto six months, may be recorded if desired. However, as such a short interval of\ntime is involved, easy reference can be made to the purchase order or similar\ndocument so that a special guarantee record is not required. In any event, the\nproject manager still has the responsibility of ascertaining whether the\nguarantee period has expired before authorizing repairs to guaranteed\nitems. (e) Records or information\non guarantees should be arranged so as to alert the project manager 30 days\nprior to the expiration date of any guarantee so that repairs or adjustments, if needed, can be made before the expiration of the guarantee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1628-4.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
