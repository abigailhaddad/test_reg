(3)\n\nExcept as provided by paragraph (4) of\nthis subdivision, an out-of-state conviction for any offense comparable to one\nlisted in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision shall also be considered a\nbar to eligibility. Any conviction for attempt to commit an offense listed in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, other than a conviction for assault in the\nsecond degree, shall render an inmate ineligible. Any conviction for attempt to\ncommit or conspiracy to commit an offense listed in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision shall render an inmate ineligible.

(4)\n\nConviction for homicide or assault shall\nnot be considered a bar to eligibility if: (i) the victim of such homicide or assault\nwas a member of the inmate's immediate family, i.e., the\nspouse, former spouse, parent, child, sibling, or any other person who\nregularly resides or who has resided in the household of the inmate, or had a\nchild in common with the inmate; and\n(ii)\nthe inmate was subjected to substantial\nphysical, sexual, or psychological abuse by the victim of such homicide or\nassault; and\n(iii)\nsuch abuse was a\nsubstantial factor in causing the inmate to commit the homicide or\nassault. (5)\n\nUnless\nalready provided, the inmate must agree to provide a DNA sample for forensic\nanalysis. (6)\n\nNo inmate shall be\nconsidered eligible for participation in the temporary release program if the\ninmate: (i) was eligible to participate in\nthe shock incarceration program and chose not to participate in that program; or\n(ii)\nentered the shock\nincarceration program but failed to successfully complete the program for any\nreason other than an intervening circumstance beyond the control of the\ninmate. (7)\n\nOutstanding\nwarrants/detainers, commitments, open charges or immigration status. (i) The offender rehabilitation coordinator\nshall ensure that the inmate has none of the following warrants/detainers which\nwould bar the inmate from participation in a temporary release program: (a) Family Court warrant (except alimony, child support or paternity); (b) out-of-state or Federal criminal detainer; (c) felony arrest warrant for a crime which\nis not barred by the statute of limitations, as provided by CPL section\n30.10; (d) misdemeanor arrest\nwarrant for a crime committed on or after the imposition of the inmate's\ncurrent sentence of imprisonment which is not barred by the statute of\nlimitations as provided by CPL section 30.10; (e) bench warrant; (f) violation of probation warrant, in or\nout-of-state, or out-of-state parole warrant; (g) immigration warrant; (h) military warrant; (i) securing order; or\n(j) if there is an indication of an active\nwarrant and the warrant has not been filed at the facility, the offender\nrehabilitation coordinator must initiate correspondence to the issuing agency\nto determine the status of the warrant. If no response is received to official\ndepartmental communication within 30 days of the request, it will be construed\nthat the warrant in question is no longer active and is not a bar to the\ninmate's participation in temporary release programs. (ii)\n\nThe offender rehabilitation coordinator\nshall make sure that the inmate has none of the following commitments which\nwould bar him/her from participation in temporary release: (a) concurrent and/or consecutive commitment\nto a local N.Y.S. jurisdiction for a definite sentence that will have to be\nserved in local custody upon the inmate's release from this department's\ncustody (unless the sentencing court has indicated in writing that there is no\nobjection to the inmate's participation in temporary release programs); or\n(b) concurrent and/or\nconsecutive out-of-state or Federal commitments, unless the other jurisdiction\nhas paroled or released the inmate in writing, or the sentencing authority has\nsubmitted, in writing, that there is no objection to the inmate's participation\nin temporary release programs; or\n(c) a failure to respond to official\ncommunication within 30 days will be construed as an indication that no\nobjection exists by the sentencing authority of the inmate's participation in a\ntemporary release program. The letter to the sentencing authority must advise\nthem of this 30-day deadline. (iii)\n\nAll outstanding charges must be\nresolved, regardless if there are active warrants or not and regardless of the\ntime frame. The following procedure will be operative: (a) Upon identification of an outstanding\nfelony charge that is not barred by the statute of limitations, as provided by\nCPL section 30.10, the offender rehabilitation coordinator shall initiate\ncorrespondence with the appropriate court in order to ascertain whether the\ncharge is still outstanding. (b) Upon identification of an outstanding misdemeanor charge for a crime committed\non or after the imposition of the inmate's present sentence of imprisonment\nthat is not barred by the statute of limitations as provided by CPL section\n30.10, the offender rehabilitation coordinator shall initiate correspondence\nwith the appropriate court in order to ascertain whether the charge is still\noutstanding. (c) A failure to\nrespond to official communication within 30 days shall be construed as proof\nthat the charge is no longer outstanding. After the 30-day period has elapsed, the inmate's application is to be processed using the information readily\navailable. Open charges for which no disposition is received are not to be\ncounted against the inmate in determining his/her point score. (d) Immigration status. (1)\n\nPrior to the processing of a temporary\nrelease program application, the Department of Corrections and Community\n\nSupervision must request clarification of an alien inmate applicant's\nimmigration status. The purpose of this inquiry is to determine the inmate's\nimmigration status and to clarify whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(ICE) is going to order deportation proceedings upon the inmate's release from\n\nState custody. (2)\nA letter must be\nforwarded to ICE regarding the possibility of deportation proceedings against\nthe inmate. A failure by ICE to respond to an inquiry within 30 days will be\nconstrued as an indication by ICE that they do not intend to initiate\ndeportation proceedings. The letter must advise ICE of the 30-day\ndeadline. (3)\n\nAn inmate shall be\nineligible for temporary release consideration if a response from ICE: (i) indicates deportation proceedings are\nunderway; (ii)\nindicates a show\ncause order for deportation; and\n(iii)\nthere is an actual ICE warrant on\nfile. (8)\n\nRecent serious disciplinary infraction. The offender rehabilitation coordinator shall make sure that the inmate has\nnot, in the eight weeks prior to application, been confined in special housing, keeplocked, or subject to room/dorm restrictions for longer than 30 days, or\nhad any recommended loss of good time. The eight-week period will be counted\nbeginning with the first day after his/her release from disciplinary\nconfinement or at the time of restoration of good time. Applications will not\nbe accepted from inmates while they are in special housing, keeplock or subject\nto room/dorm restrictions. (9)\n\nAbsconding from a temporary release program. The offender rehabilitation\ncoordinator shall make sure that the inmate has not been found guilty of\nabsconding from a temporary release program since September 1, 1977. Inmates\nfound guilty in a disciplinary proceeding of returning more than 10 hours late\nbeyond the time they were due shall be deemed absconders and, therefore, ineligible for temporary release. (10)\n(i) Time in system. Inmates under sentence for offenses as described in Correction\n\nLaw, section 851.2(a), (b) and (c), shall not be permitted to participate in\ntemporary release programs if they have not served at least six months in\ncustody. Jail time shall be credited toward that six-month requirement (except\nleave of absence). (ii)\n\nInmates not\nunder sentence for offenses as described in Correction Law, section 851.2(a), (b) and (c), may apply for and be permitted to participate in temporary release\nprograms upon reception provided that a parole eligibility date is known, and\nthat they are in all other ways eligible and qualified pursuant to the\n\nCorrection Law and the rules and regulations of the temporary release\nprogram. (iii)\n\nReturn parole\nviolators (RPV) must serve at least six months state time after their most\nrecent return before they can apply for temporary release. (iv)\n\nInterruptions in the serving of a\nsentence due to the inmate being out to court will not be counted toward the\nsix-month custody requirement. (11)\n\nApplication timing. Anyone whose last\napplication for temporary release has been disapproved must wait at least eight\nweeks from date of original disapproval before reapplication for the same type\nof temporary release, unless otherwise directed to wait a longer period prior\nto reapplication except for leave of absence. (12)\n\nYouthful offender status. If the inmate\nis a youthful offender, the point system will not be used in deciding on\nhis/her case. Youthful offenders will be treated as if they scored in the\nregular consideration range. The inmate will appear before the temporary\nrelease committee and the temporary release committee will make a\nrecommendation. (d) Notice to inmate. (1)\n\nThe\noffender rehabilitation coordinator shall notify the inmate via the\nnotification to inmate form of the results of the preliminary screening. The\ninmate should receive specific notice of statutory ineligibility, outstanding\nwarrants, a serious disciplinary penalty, failure to follow furlough timing\nguidelines, improper furlough or leave of absence purpose. If eligible, the\ninmate will be notified of his/her scheduled preliminary meeting with the\noffender rehabilitation coordinator/offender rehabilitation coordinator aide\nand temporary release committee appearance. (2)\n\nIf the inmate disputes any information\nused to determine his/her ineligibility, the inmate may request a meeting with\nhis/her assigned offender rehabilitation coordinator. (3)\n\nThe offender rehabilitation coordinator\nwill assist the inmate in clarifying any discrepancies with the official\nrecord. (e) Scoring the application. The offender rehabilitation coordinator shall score the\napplication using the temporary release point system on the application work\nsheet making one copy for his/her department files and one for the inmate. The\noffender rehabilitation coordinator will then do the preliminary screening for\nthose cases described in subdivision (n) of this section. There are 11 items in\nthe point score system. Six are based on criminal history and five are based on\nbehavior while under departmental custody. The items in the point system and\nthe manner in which they should be scored are as follows: (1)\n\nCriminal history. (i) Prior incarceration(s) following\nadjudication, if within the last 10 years prior to his/her current\nincarceration the inmate has not been in jail or prison as a result of a\nconviction, he/she scores +1 point. If the only incarceration in the last 10\nyears resulted from a misdemeanor or YO adjudication, he/she scores 0 points. If he/she was incarcerated within the last 10 years for a felony adjudication, he/she scores -1 point. Sentences to time served are counted as incarceration\nafter adjudication. (The 10-year period is counted back from the date of the\ncurrent incarceration, excluding any period of incarceration in that time, in\neffect, extending the 10-year period by an equal amount of time.)\n(ii)\n\nPrior or subsequent felony convictions. (a) This item penalizes an inmate for felony\nconvictions satisfied prior to his/her current incarceration and penalizes\ninmates for felony convictions resulting from criminal acts committed during\nthe current period of incarceration. (b) If the instant offense(s) is the inmate's\nonly felony conviction within the last 10 years, he/she scores 2 points. If\nhe/she was convicted of a felony once before in the last 10 years, he/she\nscores 0 points. If in addition to the current conviction(s) and one additional\nprior conviction, he/she had other arrests resulting in a felony conviction\n(including an arrest and conviction subsequent to his/her instant reception and\nduring the present incarceration), he/she scores -2 points. (c) If the inmate receives a felony\nconviction for a criminal act committed during his/her current period of\nincarceration and he/she has no prior felony convictions, he/she shall score no\npoints. Two or more subsequent felony convictions will score -2\npoints. (d) Where violation of\nprobation or parole results in a new commitment(s), the felony on which the\ninmate was convicted resulting in that probation or parole, will be counted, for point score purposes, as a prior felony conviction(s). (The 10-year period\nis counted back from the date of the current incarceration, excluding any\nperiod of incarceration in that time, in effect, extending the 10-year period\nby an equal amount of time.)\n(iii)\n\nPrior or subsequent misdemeanor\nconvictions. (a) This item penalizes an inmate\nfor misdemeanor convictions satisfied prior to his/her current incarceration\nand penalizes the inmate for misdemeanor convictions resulting from criminal\nacts committed during the current period of incarceration. (b) If the inmate has not been convicted of a\nmisdemeanor within the last 10 years, he/she scores +1 point. He/she scores no\npoints if he/she has been convicted of three or fewer misdemeanors in the last\n10 years (including arrests and convictions subsequent to his/her instant\nreception and during the present incarceration). If he/she has been convicted\nof four or more misdemeanors within the past 10 years, (including arrests and\nconvictions subsequent to his/her instant reception and during the present\nincarceration), he/she scores -1 point. (c) If the inmate receives a misdemeanor\nconviction for a criminal act committed during his/her current period of\nincarceration and he/she has no prior misdemeanor convictions, he/she shall\nscore no points. Misdemeanor convictions resulting from acts committed during\nthe present incarceration are counted the same as prior convictions. (The\n10-year period is counted back from the date of the current incarceration, excluding any period of incarceration in that time, in effect, extending the\n10-year period by an equal amount of time.)\n(iv)\n\nOutstanding warrants at time of or\nsubsequent date of commitment. (+2 points if none, 0 points if 1 or more.) If\nan inmate had any outstanding criminal warrants at the time of his/her\nincarceration or had any lodged after he/she was incarcerated, he/she gets no\npoints. He/she gets 2 points if he/she had no outstanding criminal warrants. Alimony, child support or paternity warrants and warrants which the inmate can\nshow were cleared solely for lack of evidence or solely due to mistaken\nidentity shall not be counted. Those New York State parole violators returned\nto custody are scored as having no New York State parole warrants\npending. (v) Previous arrest and\nconviction or revocation while on parole or probation in last 10 years (or\nsubsequent to commitment date of current incarceration) if resulting from\nabscondance, rearrest or technical violation (+2 points if none, 0 points if\none or more). (The 10-year period is counted back from the date of the current\nincarceration, excluding any period of incarceration in that time, in effect, extending the 10-year period by an equal amount of time.) If within the last 10\nyears, the inmate never had parole or probation revoked because of arrest, absconding or technical violation, he/she get 2 points. Otherwise, he/she gets\nno points. It is presumed in the absence of a formal revocation proceeding that\nparole or probation has been revoked following rearrest and conviction, or\nabsconding. (vi)\n\nNature of prior, current and subsequent convictions of crimes against the person within the last\n10 years or subsequent to date of commitment of current incarceration (-6\npoints as noted below; -4 points as noted below; -2 points as noted below; 0\npoints if crime is not listed below or is an attempt of a crime not listed\nbelow. The 10-year period is counted back from the date of current\nincarceration, excluding any period of incarceration in that time, in effect, extending the 10-year period by an equal amount of time. (a) In this item, the more serious the crime\nagainst the person, the more points the inmate loses. Attempted crimes will be\nincluded in the same categories as completed crimes.

An inmate may earn this point by accumulating eight months of\nparticipation in a program or work assignment for the period of 25-36 months\nprior to application. An inmate can earn 1 point by getting eight months credit\nfor participation in programs or work assignment in the period 25-36 months\nprior to his/her application. He/she cannot earn this point unless he/she has\nbeen incarcerated for more than 24 months. (iii)\n\nDiscipline I (maximum 4 points) (+1\npoint if 0 disciplinary proceeding decisions in the last three months imposing\na loss of any privileges for 14 days or more, or any term of special housing or\nkeeplock; +1 point if one or fewer disciplinary proceeding decisions imposing\nsuch penalties in the last six months; +1 point if two or fewer disciplinary\nproceeding decisions imposing such penalties in the last nine months; +1 point\nif three or fewer disciplinary proceeding decisions imposing such penalties in\nthe last 12 months. Good time lost will be equated to keeplock for\npoint-scoring purpose). In this subparagraph an inmate can earn up to 4 points. He/she can earn a point for having a good disciplinary record over the last\nthree months, another point for having a good record over the last six months, another point for having a good record over the last 9 months, and a fourth\npoint for having a good record over the last year. Therefore, it is possible to\nscore 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points on this item. An inmate gets 1 point for having\nno counted disciplinary proceedings in the last three months, another point for\nhaving one or fewer counted proceedings over the last six months, another point\nfor having two or fewer counted proceedings over the last nine months, and\nanother point for having three or fewer counted proceedings over the last 12\nmonths. Only disciplinary proceedings resulting in penalties of room/dorm\nrestrictions, keeplock or special housing, or 14 days or more loss of\nprivileges are counted for the purposes of this item. (iv)\n\nDiscipline II (maximum 1 point). (+1\npoint if three or fewer disciplinary proceedings decisions imposing any term of\nspecial housing or decisions imposing any term of special housing or keeplock, or a loss of any privilege for 14 days or more in the period 12-24 months prior\nto application, provided that the inmate has been incarcerated at least 24\nconsecutive months in a New York State Department of Corrections and Community\n\nSupervision facility at the time of application; 0 points if four or more). An\ninmate can earn 1 point on this item if he/she has been incarcerated for at\nleast 24 months and if during the period 12-24 months prior to application\nhe/she had three or fewer disciplinary proceedings resulting in any penalty of\nspecial housing or keeplock, room/dorm restrictions or in a loss of privileges\nfor 14 days or more. (v) Temporary\nrelease record. (a) (-6 points if convicted of\na crime while on temporary release within the last year; -3 points if removed\nfrom work release or educational leave for disciplinary reasons other than\nrearrest within the last year; -3 points if convicted while on temporary\nrelease within the period 13-24 months prior to application; -2 points if\nwithin the last six months returned late or under the influence of drugs or\nalcohol or violated any temporary release program rules other than by rearrest\nor by disciplinary removals specified above; +2 points if most recent\nunescorted participation on temporary release was successful and occurred\nduring the past year; or +4 points if the two most recent unescorted\nparticipations on temporary release were successful and occurred during the\npast year; 0 points if none of the above). (b) This subparagraph gives an inmate points\nif he/she has been out successfully on temporary release. It takes away points\nif he/she was out on temporary release and violated the conditions of his/her\nrelease. He/she gets no points if he/she has never been out on unescorted\ntemporary release. This item applies only to temporary release participation\nduring the current period of incarceration. A returned parole violator' s term\nof incarceration is deemed to begin on the date of his/her latest return as a\nparole violator. (c) If his/her\nmost recent unescorted participation in temporary release was a success and\ntook place in the last year during his/her current incarceration, he/she gets 2\npoints. If the two most recent participations on temporary release were a\nsuccess and took place in the last year during his/her current incarceration, he/she gets 4 points. He/she gets no points if it took place more than one year\nago or was an escorted or a supervised group activity, or if he/she has had\nhis/her parole revoked since his/her last successful participation in temporary\nrelease. (d) Under the new\ntemporary release law, effective September 1, 1977, anyone who, after\ndisciplinary proceedings, has been found to be an absconder shall be ineligible\nfor participation in temporary release. (e) He/she will lose 3 points if during the\nlast year he/she has been removed from a work or educational release program\nfor reasons other than rearrest. (f) He/she will lose 2 points if within the\nlast six months he/she has violated any temporary release program rules other\nthan by rearrest or by disciplinary removals specified above. (g) If any of these violations took place\nover six months ago, he/she loses no points. In figuring out the point score\nfor this item an inmate may lose points on some things and gain some on others. For instance, if he/she was removed from work release for reasons other than\nrearrest or absconding 10 months ago, he/she would lose 3 points. But if the\nlast furlough six months ago was a success, he/she would gain 2 points. His/her\noverall point score for subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph is -1 (-3 + [+2]) =\n-1. (3)\n\nTotal\nscore. (i) After each individual has been\nscored, the number of points is totaled. A standard adjustment, +26 points, is\nadded to that total to assure the final score is not negative. (ii)\n\nThere are five scoring ranges: low-denied, low-open date (O.D.), low probation eligible, nonstatutory high, and refer to temporary release committee. Low-denied scores cannot be accepted\ninto temporary release programs. Other scores will be referred to the temporary\nrelease committee for recommendation. (f) Schedule inmate meeting. If the preliminary review reveals that the inmate is\neligible for temporary release, the offender rehabilitation coordinator will\nnotify the inmate of the scheduled temporary release committee\nappearance. (1)\n\nAt the first temporary\nrelease committee meeting, the inmate's appearance is mandatory. (2)\n\nFor subsequent applications for the same\ntype temporary release program, the offender rehabilitation coordinator must\nadvise the inmate that he/she may waive the right to appear before the\ntemporary release committee in writing. (3)\n\nFor incapacitated inmates, the appearance\nbefore the temporary release committee may be waived. (g) Offender rehabilitation\ncoordinator/offender rehabilitation coordinator aide meets with inmate. It is mandatory for the offender rehabilitation\ncoordinator/offender rehabilitation coordinator aide to meet with the inmate to\ndiscuss his/her application eligibility or ineligibility. Inmates who score in\nthe low range must be informed. After scoring the application and preliminary\nscreening for review categories, the ORC shall meet with the inmate to explain\nhow the application was scored and the range into which he/she falls. Possible\ninclusion in a central monitoring case category, statutory review or special\nreview category shall be noted, where necessary. Any disputes about information\nused to score the application must be documented by the offender rehabilitation\ncoordinator. (h) Verification. (1)\n\nIf there is no\nindication in the files that information is inaccurate, the offender\nrehabilitation coordinator shall require the inmate to provide some proof that\nthe information in the file is inaccurate. The offender rehabilitation\ncoordinator will assist the inmate to clarify any discrepancies in the official\nrecord. The inmate will be referred to Freedom of Information Act procedures\nregarding access to inmate files. At the close of the interview, the offender\nrehabilitation coordinator shall give the inmate a copy of the application work\nsheet/point score. (2)\n\nTo confirm\nan inmate's eligibility pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the\noffender rehabilitation coordinator shall: (i) review all available inmate records to\ndetermine if official documentation exists to verify that the inmate was\nsubjected to substantial physical, sexual, or psychological abuse, committed by\nthe victim, and that such abuse was a substantial factor in causing the inmate\nto commit the crime. This documentation may include, but is not limited to, witness statements, social service records, hospital records, and law\nenforcement records, and a showing based in part on documentation prepared at\nor near the time of the commission of the offense or the prosecution thereof\ntending to support the inmate's claim; and\n(ii)\nsend letters to the prosecuting district\nattorney and the sentencing court requesting opinions on the inmate's claim of\neligibility for temporary release pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section\nand advising that responses will be taken into consideration if received within\n45 days. (i) Determination of official score. After the interview, the inmate has two work days to\nchallenge information used in the point score. At the end of that time, if the\ninmate has not challenged the scoring, or as soon as all disputes have been\nreviewed, the offender rehabilitation coordinator shall refer the scored\napplication to the temporary release committee chairperson. (j) Temporary release committee\nchairperson reviews. The temporary release committee chairperson must review all\napplications for eligibility including central monitoring cases (CMC), special\nreviews and statutory status. The chairperson will then review the score which\nbecomes official upon his/her approval. He/she will also check the file to\ndetermine possible low-point status or possible inclusion in CMC, statutory\nreview or special review categories. (1)\nA low-point inmate who would not normally\nbe considered for temporary release because he/she scores in the low range, may\nbe considered for release by the temporary release committee if one of the\nfollowing conditions applies: (i) he/she has\nbeen given an O.D. (community preparation open date) status by the parole board\nand central office approval has been obtained; (ii)\nhe/she is a graduate of the shock\nincarceration program; (iii)\nhe/she\nis a graduate of the CASAT annex program; (iv)\nhe/she is a first felony offender who\nlegally would have been eligible to receive a sentence of probation instead of\nthe sentence of imprisonment that was actually imposed: probation\neligible. (2)\n\nYouthful\noffenders. Point score cannot be used in determining the case if the inmate is\na youthful offender. (3)\n\nThe\nchairperson will then schedule an interview for all inmates scoring in the\nregular consideration range, low probation eligible range or low-O.D. range. Notice of hearing forms will be prepared and sent out by the\nchairperson. (4)\n\nOnly in the case\nof furlough application, where an inmate has a high point score of 40 or more\nand the inmate is not serving a sentence for crimes described in section\n851(2); are not designated as a CMC; are not low O.D. cases; are not low\nprobation eligible cases and are not cases which fall into the special review\nor statutory categories, the temporary release committee does not make a\nrecommendation. The application will automatically be forwarded by the\ntemporary release committee to the superintendent for approval or denial\nrecommendation. (k) Notification of official score. Inmates shall be notified of their official point score, the range into which it falls, and any scheduled appearance before the\ntemporary release committee via the notification to inmate form. (l) Inmate appearance before\nthe temporary release committee. (1)\n\nThe temporary release committee will schedule a personal interview with all\ninitial applications. This appearance may be waived for incapacitated\ninmates. (2)\n\nThe temporary release\ncommittee must inform the inmate of inclusion of statutory review, CMC or\nspecial review categories and must inform the inmate of his/her point\nscore. (3)\n\nAfter meeting the\ninmate, the temporary release committee will make a recommendation regarding\nthe inmate's suitability as a candidate for temporary release\nprograms. (4)\n\nThe committee's\nrecommendation must be made at a meeting of the full committee and\napproved. (5)\nA recommendation must\nbe approved by a majority vote of all three committee members. In making its\nrecommendation, the committee should center its attention on the inmate's score\non the 11 items in the point-scoring system and on their interview with the\ninmate as well as the other methods of evaluating inmates, including\nrecommendations by staff. Committee members may also take note of those aspects\nof the applicant's record not formally taken into account by the point system, such as the quality of the inmate's performance in programs or on work\nassignment, performance in other correction systems where concurrent sentence\nhas been served and where information is available, or the nature of prior\ndisciplinary infractions. The committee shall also take into account any\nfactors, besides the items in the point system, which, in their best judgment, they find significant. In general, the applicant's ability to profit from\nparticipation in temporary release should be weighed against whatever risk to\nthe community or to the integrity of the program that would be posed by his/her\nparticipation in a temporary release program. (6)\n\nReview of the inmate folder. When\nexamining the folder, the committee should review the crime and determine the\ncircumstances involved in the instant offense. If it is a crime of violence\nagainst a person, the degree of aggressiveness involved and whether it resulted\nin serious physical injury to any party, or involved the use of or threat of\nuse of a weapon should be established. The presentence and sentencing documents\nshould be considered in determining the circumstances of the crime. (7)\n\nStandard for referral. Inmates should not\nbe recommended for temporary release programs if their presence in the\ncommunity or in a temporary release program would pose an unwarranted threat to\ntheir own or public safety, if public reaction is such that the inmate's\nsuccessful participation in the program would be made difficult, if public\nacceptance of the temporary release program would be jeopardized, or if there\nis substantial evidence to indicate the inmate cannot successfully complete\nhis/her requested temporary release program. (8)\n\nNew case information. If at any stage in\nthe recommendation process, new or additional information in the case becomes\navailable, the temporary release committee shall review that information to\ndetermine if it could affect the recommendation made by the temporary release\ncommittee. The temporary release committee chairperson shall determine if the\ntemporary release committee should review that new information, meet with the\ninmate and render an official updated decision. That information will be\nconveyed to central office. (m) All recommendations by the temporary\nrelease committee will be forwarded to the superintendent accompanied by any\nsupporting documentation. The superintendent shall review the application and\nsupporting documentation prior to submitting his/her recommendation to the\noffice of temporary release programs. (n) Referral to central office. All applications must be referred to central office for\nreview and decision. (1)\n\nStatutory\nreview categories. Instant offenses involving the possession, use or threatened\nuse of a weapon; a case resulting in prolonged physical injury, disability or\ndeath of the victim; a sexual offense by forcible compulsion. Final approval\nfor statutory review cases rests with the commissioner or designee. Serious\nphysical injury means physical injury which creates a substantial risk of\ndeath, injury which causes death, or injury which causes serious and protracted\nimpairment of health or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any\nbody organ. (2)\n\nCentral monitoring\ncases (CMC). A CMC case must also be approved by the commissioner or his/her\ndesignee. (3)\n\nLow-open date (O.D.)\nand low probation eligible (P.E.) cases must be approved by the commissioner or\nhis/her designee. (4)\n\nSpecial\nreview categories. While the commissioner need not approve special review\ncases, the director of temporary release or designee will make the final\ndetermination. (i) any prior or instant\narson-related convictions; (ii)\nprior or instant sex-related felonies; (iii)\nany convictions for conspiracy, criminal facilitation or criminal solicitation, involving cases which would\nnormally be considered \"statutory\" in nature; (iv)\ncases with three or more felony\nconvictions, including any YO adjudications or felony offenses; (v) prior parole violations and/or prior\ntemporary release program violations or removals; (vi)\na mental health history includes one or\nmore of the following factors: (a) prior\nhospitalization for mental illness, including treatment in a military\nhospital; (b) a prior suicide\nattempt; (c) prior referral to a\nhospital or institutional unit for psychiatric diagnosis and\nevaluation; (d) any\ncontraindications noted by mental hygiene staff; (e) a history of out-patient\nservices; (vii)\nany\nkidnapping convictions; and\n(viii)\nif the victim(s) or bystander(s) as a result of the instant offense (I.O.)\nincurred physical injury and the I.O. is not already statutory\nreview. (5)\n\nApplications\nwhose eligibility was established pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Copies of official documentation used to verify the abuse, and letters sent the\ndistrict attorney and the sentencing court and responses, if any, shall be\ntransmitted to central office temporary release at the same time as the\napplication. Any responses received after 45 days shall be immediately\ntransmitted to central office temporary release. (6)\n\nUnder no circumstances shall any\ntemporary release application for inmates within the aforementioned categories\nbe deemed approved without central office approval. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
