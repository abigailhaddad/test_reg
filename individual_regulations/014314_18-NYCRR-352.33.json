Tit. 18 § 352.33 - Deeming of sponsor's income and resources\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as provided in subdivisions (b)\nand (c) of this section, all the income and resources of a sponsor of an alien\nwho has signed an affidavit of support pursuant to section 213a of the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act, and all the income and resources of such\nsponsor's spouse is deemed available to such alien for purposes of determining\nthe eligibility of such alien for family assistance and federally funded safety\nnet assistance. A sponsor's income and resources will no longer be deemed\navailable to the alien when the alien: (1)\nachieves United States citizenship through the naturalization process; or\n(2)\nhas worked 40 qualifying\nquarters of coverage as defined under title II of the Social Security Act or\ncan be credited with such qualifying quarters as provided under Federal law\nand, in the case of any such qualifying quarter creditable for any period\nbeginning after December 31, 1996, did not receive any Federal means-tested\npublic benefit during any such period. (b) If the social services district\ndetermines that a sponsored alien would, in the absence of assistance provided\nby the agency, be unable to obtain food and shelter, taking into account the\nalien's own income plus any cash, food or housing or other assistance provided\nby other individuals, including the actual amount of income and resources\nprovided by the sponsor or sponsor's spouse, the agency must: (1)\nbudget only the amount of income and\nresources which the sponsor or the sponsor's spouse actually contributes to the\nalien for a period beginning on the date of such determination and ending 12\nmonths after such date; and\n(2)\nnotify the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance of the department of\neach such determination including the names of the sponsor and the sponsored\nalien involved in the manner prescribed by the department.

This\nsubdivision does not apply unless the battery or cruelty bears a substantial\nconnection to the need for benefits or if the person responsible for such\nbattery or cruelty resides in the same household as the individual who was\nsubject to the battery or cruelty. (d) If and to the extent that family\nassistance, safety net assistance, additional state payments in the\nsupplemental security income program, emergency assistance to aged, blind or\ndisabled adults or emergency assistance to needy families with children is paid\nto or on behalf of an alien for whom an affidavit of support pursuant to\nsection 213a of the Immigration and Nationality Act has been signed, the social\nservices district must request reimbursement by the alien's sponsor in the\namount of such assistance, and, if the alien's sponsor does not within 45 days\nof such request indicate a willingness to commence payments, such social\nservices district may commence an action against the sponsor pursuant to the\naffidavit. Indications of a willingness to pay may include only: payment in\nfull, commencement of substantial periodic payments, entry into a payment\nagreement or a written assurance of payments on a reasonable basis. Oral\nassurance of payment shall not be sufficient.
