  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 4.1 - Leeway investments\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked whether mutual savings institutions\nmay use the \"leeway\" investment authorization (Banking Law, § 235[29]) for the\npurpose of making investments which are specifically authorized under one of\nthe other 28 subdivisions of section 235. The department took the position that\nsince the opening sentence of subdivision 29 explicitly states that the\n\"leeway\" provision is applicable to \"[i]nvestments which do not qualify under\nany\nof the preceding subdivisions,\" such use of the\nauthorization would be improper. Thus, the department concluded that a savings\ninstitution may not, for example, carry on its books, as a \"leeway\" investment, bonds and mortgages or notes and mortgages on improved and unencumbered real\nproperty which would satisfy the requirements of section\n235\n(6)\nof the Banking Law, or preferred, guaranteed or common stock of a corporation which would meet the requirements\nof section 235(26). The department was also asked whether \"leeway\" may be used\nfor investments which do not \"qualify\" under preceding subdivisions of section\n235\nof the Banking\n\nLaw because the limitation on the aggregate amount of the investment, recited\nin the subdivision under which the investment would otherwise be authorized, has already been met. The department stated that such use of the \"leeway\"\nauthorization, too, would be improper, because paragraph (d) of subdivision 29\nprovides that \"[t]his subdivision shall not be deemed to alter any provision of\nthis chapter deemed to alter any provision of this chapter limiting the\naggregate amount which may be invested in any class of loan or investment.\"\nAccordingly, the department stated that a savings institution may not, for\nexample, exceed the subdivision (9)(a)(1) limitation on its bank premises\naccount by carrying bank premises real estate on its books as a \"leeway\"\ninvestment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n4.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
