  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 429.10 - Appendix A\nState Regulations\n\nThe provisions of American Society of Testing and Materials\n(\"ASTM\") standard E2187-02b \"Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition\n\nStrength of Cigarettes,\" referenced in section\n429.3\n(a) of this\n\nTitle, are modified for the purposes of this rule as follows: (1)\n\nSection 6.2.2. is changed to read: Respiratory equipment shall be made available for personnel\nupon request or if the environmental conditions in the laboratory\nwarrant. (2)\n\nSections 7.3 to\n7.5. are changed to allow the following dimensions and allowances for the test\napparatus: inches\nmm\n\nDimension\n\nTolerance\n\nDimension\n\nTolerance\n\nTest Chamber\n\nHeight\n13.4\n1\n340\n25\n\nWidth\n11.5\n0.25\n292\n6\n\nDepth\n15.5\n0.25\n394\n6\n\nThickness\n0.25\nnominal\n6\nnominal\n\nChimney Height\n6.5\n0.5\n165\n13\n\nChimney I.D. 6.0\n0.25\n152\n6\n\nFilter Paper Holder\nO.D. 6.5\n0.04\n165\n1\nI.D. 5.0\n0.04\n127\n1\n\nHeight\n1.97\n0.04\n50\n1\n\nRecess Depth\n0.4\n0.01\n10\n2.5\n\nRecess I.D. 6.0\n0.04\n152\n1\n\nMetal Rim\nO.D. 5.9\n0.08\n150\n2\nI.D. 5.1\n0.08\n130\n2\n\nThickness\n0.25\n0.04\n6.4\n1\n\nPin Diameter\n0.04\nnominal\n1\nnominal\n\nPin Separation\n0.32\n0.02\n8.1\n0.05\n\nPin Length\n0.65\n0.15\n17\n4\n\nNote: The outer diameter of the metal rim is not to exceed the\ninner diameter of the recess in the filter paper holder. (3)\n\nSection 7.6 is changed to read that the\nholder shall not contact the cigarette within a nominal 30 mm (1.2 in) of its\nlit end. (4)\n\nSection 7.7. is\nchanged to delete the word \"pencil\" in describing the mark on the\ncigarette. (5)\n\nSection 8.1.2. is\nchanged to read: The non-turbulent smoke column height is to be a nominal 150\nmm (6 in) above the lit end of the cigarette. (6)\n\nSection 9.1. is changed to read: Cigarette test specimens and filter paper substrates are\nsensitive to contamination. Test cigarettes shall be handled only by the last\nnominal 25 mm (1 in) of the end of the cigarette that is not to be lit. The\nsheets of filter paper shall not be handled in the vicinity where the cigarette\nwill contact the paper during a test. In all cases, the materials shall be\nhandled with dry hands only. Note: The use of clean, dry, non-powdered surgical gloves can\nmitigate incidental contamination of the test materials while maintaining\noperator dexterity. (7)\n\nThe\nlast sentence in 9.2.1 is changed to read: If the specimens are to be stored by the testing laboratory\nfor more than one week, they shall be placed in a freezer at approximately 0 C\n(32 F) to -20 C (-4 F) reserved for the sole protection of cigarette specimens\nto minimize the risk of contamination. (8)\n\nSection 9.2.2 is changed to read: Prior to testing, cigarette test specimens shall be marked, using a #2 or softer graphite pencil or other marking, 5 mm ±1 mm and 15\nmm ±1 mm (0.2 in and 0.6 in, each ±0.04 in) from the end of the\ncigarette that will be lit. These marks are used to establish the start (11.4)\nand completion (11.5.4) of a uniform pre-burn period, respectively. Neither the\nprocess of marking the cigarette nor the mark itself shall significantly affect\nthe cigarette burn rate. (9)\n\nIn Section 9.3 and its subparagraphs, the mean mass, rather than the median\nmass shall be used in all cases. In addition, the following Section 9.3.3. is\nadded to Section 9.3: 9.3.3. Pending assurance of the availability of filter paper\nthat meets the specifications in Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2, the following\nprovisions apply: Paper with a mean conditioned mass of 25.1 g to 26.6 g (for\n15 sheets) and a mean dry mass of 23.7 g to 25.2 g shall be used for the\ntesting of cigarettes. The standard deviation of at least five samples (dry or\nconditioned) shall not exceed 0.4 g. (10)\n\nSection 10.1. is changed to read: Cigarettes shall be conditioned at a relative humidity of\n55± 5 percent and a temperature of 23 ± 30°C (73 ±\n5°F) for at least 24 h prior to testing. The cigarettes shall be placed in\na clean, open container, with the number of cigarettes being sufficiently small\nas to enable free air access to the specimens, for example, a maximum of 20\ncigarettes in a 250 mL polyethylene or glass beaker. (11)\n\nThe following note is added to section\n11.4.1: Note: This provision need not be followed by an individual test\noperator if that operator has demonstrated that lifting the restriction does\nnot introduce error that significantly changes either the measured ignition\nstrength or the uncertainty of that measurement. This determination is the\nresponsibility of the testing laboratory. (12)\n\nSection 11.5 is changed to read: Holding the cigarette vertically, coal end up, transport the\ncigarette to the test chamber. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n429.10\n\nIt has been found that holding a 600 mL beaker over the\ncigarette coal is helpful in mitigating the likelihood of a foreign object or\nroom air current impacting the cigarette during transport and thus leading to\nthe need to terminate the determination. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
