(b) For the purposes of this Part, the\nfollowing definitions also apply: (1)\n\nAffected engine means each engine identified by a consent decree engine\nmanufacturer in its low NO\nx\nrebuild plan. A low\nNO\nx\nrebuild engine, as that terminology is used in the\nconsent decrees, is an affected engine. (2)\n\nAlternative fuel means natural gas, propane, ethanol, methanol, gasoline (when used in hybrid electric vehicles\nonly), hydrogen, electricity, fuel cells, or advanced technologies that do not\nrely solely on diesel fuel or a diesel/non-diesel fuel mixture. (3)\n\nApproved bi-fuel vehicle means any heavy\nduty vehicle that has been retrofitted with an EPA or CARB approved\nafter-market conversion kit that will allow the engine to operate on a\ncombination of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel and compressed natural\ngas.
