  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 225-3.5 - Exceptions and variances-volatility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon application, the commissioner may grant an exception from the requirements\nof section\n225-3.3\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart to a supplier of a gasoline which contains simple alcohols upon a\nshowing that gasoline and gasoline blending components are not reasonably\navailable that, when blended, would enable the resulting fuel to meet the\nrequirements of section\n225-3.3\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart, and that granting the exception will not significantly exacerbate\nambient ozone levels. Such an exception may be issued for all or a part of the\n\nState for up to one year, and may be renewed upon application. The commissioner\nshall place conditions on exceptions granted pursuant to this subdivision\nincluding a maximum RVP allowed and the quantity of gasoline permitted to be\nsupplied under the exception. (b) Effective September 16, 1989, upon application, the commissioner, after\nconsultation with the President of the New York State Energy Research and\n\nDevelopment Authority, may grant a temporary variance from the requirements of\nsection\n225-3.3\nof this Subpart if the\napplicant for such an exception can demonstrate to the commissioner that\nquantities of gasoline sufficient to meet the demand in New York State cannot\nbe manufactured in time to meet all the requirements of section\n225-3.3\nof this Subpart. (1)\n\nThe President of the New York State\n\nEnergy Research and Development Authority, must certify that there exists an\ninsufficient supply of fuel which conforms to the standards in section\n225-3.3\nof this Subpart before a\ntemporary variance may be granted under this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe commissioner shall impose an interim\nvolatility standard and/or restrictions on the quantity of gasoline permitted\nto be supplied as conditions of a variance granted pursuant to this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nThe commissioner\nshall require that an economic adjustment fee must be deposited with the\ncommissioner before a temporary variance will be granted. The economic\nadjustment fee shall equal the economic benefit that may accrue because of the\nlower cost of gasoline that does not comply with section\n225-3.3\nof this Subpart, in\ncomparison with gasoline that does.
