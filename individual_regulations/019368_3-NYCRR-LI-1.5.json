  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 1.5 - Lending limit treatment of portions of letters of credit subject to participation agreements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department's opinion was requested as to whether a bank, which was to issue a letter of credit, could for purposes of computing lending\nlimits under section\n103\n(1)\nof the Banking Law, exclude those\nportions of its obligation under such letter of credit for which it held\nirrevocable participation agreements from other banking institutions. The\nletters of credit which were the subject of the inquiry were used to back up\ncommercial paper issued by corporate borrowers. The department noted that the primary purpose of the lending\nlimits requirement is to prevent undue exposure to the credit risk of any one\nborrower, and that such exposure is effectively reduced by irrevocable\nparticipation agreements. Accordingly, the department concluded that the lending limits\nneed only apply to that part of a letter of credit commitment retained by the\n\"lead\" bank or trust company provided (i) the participation agreements with\nother banks are irrevocable and entered into at the same time as, or prior to, the issuance of the letter of credit, and (ii) all participating banks are also\nirrevocably committed to continue their participation in any \"roll-over\" of the\nletter of credit that the lead bank is obligated to undertake. DATED: October 2, 1972\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 1.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
