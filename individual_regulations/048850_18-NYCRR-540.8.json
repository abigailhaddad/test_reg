  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 540.8 - Verification, payment and recording of medical bills\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The public\nwelfare official, on receipt of bills rendered by vendors of medical\nassistance, shall cause such bills to be classified on the basis of State or\nlocal charge status of each recipient and the charges relative thereto and a\nverification of such bills within the scope and limitations of authorizations\nissued by the public welfare official for the services billed, and with the\nschedule of fees and rates promulgated by the public welfare official for\nvendor services. Where the fees and rates promulgated by the public welfare\nofficial exceed ceiling limits set by State regulations, the amount by which\nthe charges billed exceed the State limits shall be identified and segregated\nfor purposes of preparing proper claims for State aid. (1)\n\nVerification of bills against\nauthorization and against the schedule of fees and rates includes: verification\nof mathematical accuracy of billing; conformity with all billing requirements\n(properly signed, etc.); verification of technical or professional\nqualifications where such may affect the fee to be allowed; verification of\nmileage rates and total charges; etc. (Verification of such scope may\nnecessitate provisions of internal agency examination of billings by clerical\npersonnel, in part, and by professional personnel, in part.)\n(b) The method of payment used by\nthe public welfare official to settle approved and verified bills for medical\nservices shall be in accordance with the provisions governing the particular\nplan of payment for medical services in effect in the district pursuant to\n\nState regulations with respect thereto. (c) In issuing payments for medical services\nrendered, the public welfare official may find it advisable to identify the\npayment instrument with the particular services for which payment is being\nmade. (1)\n\nWhere bills from an individual\nvendor for an individual case are settled by a one payment transaction, the\npayment instrument may show an identification of the services being paid for in\nlieu of separate notification. (2)\n\nWhere bills of a vendor for medical services covering a group of cases are\nsettled by a one-payment transaction, it will be desirable to furnish a\nstatement of the services and cases covered by the payment transaction in order\nto reconcile the items being paid with the items billed for. (d) Upon notification by the\ndepartment that a nursing home company subject to the provisions of article\n28-A of the Public Health Law, has failed to make a required payment in\naccordance with its mortgage with the New York State Housing Finance Agency or\nthe New York State Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency, the public welfare\nofficial shall take such administrative steps as may be required by the\ndepartment to insure that payment of all claims for services rendered by the\nnursing home company under the medical assistance program is made payable to\nthe nursing home company's operating escrow reserve account for the month\nspecified by the department. During such period, this payment procedure shall\nhave the same effect as the unrestricted payment of an equal amount to the\nnursing home company. (e) After\npayment of medical bills, a record shall be made: (1)\nof the amounts paid to or in behalf of\neach individual case on the individual record of assistance granted cards\nmaintained for each case; and\n(2)\nof the total transactions in the general accounts maintained by the\nagency. (f) Periodically, the sum total of amounts recorded on individual record of\nassistance granted cards should be reconciled with the control entries in the\ngeneral accounts. In addition, the public welfare official may require\nadditional records to be kept for administrative purposes. (g) No payment shall be made for care, services, or supplies for any period of time for which a notification of\nnoncoverability is received from the Commissioner of Health or his designee, or\nfor any period of time for which a notice that services were unnecessary or\ninappropriate is received from a utilization review committee or a professional\nstandards review organization.
