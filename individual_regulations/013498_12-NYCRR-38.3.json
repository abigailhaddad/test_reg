For example, the\nfollowing quantities in combination would not exceed the limitation and are\nwithin the formula: 175 (grams contained U-235)\n+\n50 (grams U-233)\n+\n50 (grams Pu)\n= 1\n350\n200\n200\n175 (grams contained U-235)/350 + 50 (grams U-233)/200 +50\n(grams Pu)/200 = 1\n(102)\n\nState\nmeans the State of New York, unless the context of this\n\nPart (rule) clearly indicates that a different meaning is intended. (103)\n\nStochastic effect\nmeans a health effect that occurs randomly and for which the probability of the\neffect occurring, rather than its severity, is assumed to be a function of dose\nwithout threshold.

(104)\n\nStray radiation\nmeans\nthe sum of leakage and scattered radiation. (105)\n\nSurvey\nmeans an\nevaluation of the radiological conditions and potential hazards incident to the\nproduction, use, transfer, release, disposal, or presence of sources of\nradiation. When appropriate, such evaluation includes, but is not limited to, tests, physical examinations, and measurements of levels of radiation or\nconcentrations of radioactive material present. (106)\n\nThese regulations\nmean\nall parts of Industrial Code Rule 38 (12 NYCRR Part\n38\n).

(109)\nUSNRC\nmeans United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. (110)\n\nUnrefined and unprocessed\nore\nmeans ore in its natural form prior to any processing, such as\ngrinding, roasting, beneficiating, or refining. (111)\n\nUse as used in radioactive\nmaterials licenses\nmeans to employ or apply radioactive materials for\nthe licensed purpose. It shall include instruction of, and responsibility for, technical and support staff members. It does not include training others in the\ntechniques of use of radioactive materials for the purpose of qualifying for\nlicensure. (112)\n\nUseful\nbeam\nmeans the radiation which passes through the source or\ntube-housing port and the aperture of the collimating device when the exposure\nswitch or timer is activated. (113)\n\nVery high radiation area\nmeans an area, accessible to\nindividuals, in which radiation levels could result in an individual receiving\nan absorbed dose in excess of 5 Gy (500 rad) in one hour at 1 meter from a\nsource of radiation or from any surface that the radiation\npenetrates. 2\n(114)\n\nWaste handling\nlicensees\nmeans persons licensed to receive and store radioactive\nwastes prior to disposal and/or persons licensed to dispose of radioactive\nwastes. (115)\n\nWeek\nmeans seven consecutive days starting on Sunday. (116)\n\nWeighting factor\nW\nT\nfor an organ or tissue (T)\nmeans the\nproportion of the risk of stochastic effects resulting from irradiation of that\norgan or tissue to the total risk of stochastic effects when the whole body is\nirradiated uniformly. For calculating the effective dose equivalent, the values\nof W\nT\nare: ORGAN DOSE WEIGHTING FACTORS\nOrgan or tissue\nW\nT\nGonads\n0.25\n\nBreast\n0.15\n\nRed bone marrow\n0.12\n\nLung\n0.12\n\nThyroid\n0.03\n\nBone surfaces\n0.03\n\nRemainder\n0.30\na\n\nWhole body\n1.00\nb\na 0.30 results from 0.06 for each of five \"remainder\"\norgans, excluding the skin and the lens of the eye, that receive the highest\ndoses. b For purposes of weighting the external whole body dose, for adding it to the internal dose, a single weighting factor, W\nT\n=1.0, has been specified. The use of other weighting\nfactors for external exposure will be approved on a case-by-case basis until\nsuch time as specific guidance is issued.

(118)\n\nWorker\nmeans an\nindividual engaged in work under a license or registration issued by the\ncommissioner and controlled by a licensee or registrant, but does not include\nthe licensee or registrant. (119)\n\nWorking level (WL)\nmeans any combination of short-lived radon\ndaughters in 1 liter of air that will result in the ultimate emission of 1.3\n× 10\n5\n\nMeV of potential alpha particle energy. The short-lived daughters of radon-222 are: polonium-218, lead-214, bismuth-214, and polonium-214. The short-lived daughters of radon-220 are: polonium-216, lead-212, bismuth-212, and polonium-212. (120)\n\nWorking level month\n(WLM)\nmeans an exposure to 1 working level for 170 hours (2,000\nworking hours per year divided by 12 months per year is approximately equal to\n170 hours per month). (121)\n\nYear\nmeans the period of time beginning in January used to\ndetermine compliance with the provisions of these regulations. The licensee or\nregistrant may change the starting date of the year used to determine\ncompliance by the licensee or registrant provided that the change is made at\nthe beginning of the year and that no day is omitted or duplicated in\nconsecutive years. Footnotes\na Absorbed dose in rad equal to 1 rem or the absorbed dose\nin gray equal to 1 Sv. b Monoenergetic neutrons incident normally on a 30-cm\ndiameter cylinder tissue-equivalent phantom. 1 The documents referenced in this Part are available for\nreview and copying at the New York State Department of Labor, State Office\n\nCampus, Building 12, Room 509, Albany, NY or the New York State Department of\n\nState, 162 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY. 2 At very high doses received at high dose rates, units of\nabsorbed dose, gray and rad, are appropriate, rather than units of dose\nequivalent, sievert and rem. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n38.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
