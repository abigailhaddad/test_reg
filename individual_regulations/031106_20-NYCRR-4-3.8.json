  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-3.8 - Rules for intermediary transactions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In the case of intermediary transactions, in applying the primary use location method or the where received method of the\nhierarchy, the location where the receipt is apportioned is based on the\nlocation of the consumers, rather than the business customer. If the\ncorporation uses reasonable approximation based on the sourced receipts method\nto source its receipts from an intermediary transaction, it may apply that\nmethod taking only transactions with that particular business customer into\nconsideration. (b) In determining\nthe primary use location or where the digital product or service is received\nfor an intermediary transaction, the corporation is required to make inquiries\nto the business customer, but not to the consumers, regardless of the number of\nbusiness customers the corporation has or the percentage of receipts the\ncorporation receives from any one business customer, in order to determine the\namount of receipts to apportion to New York State based on the location of the\nconsumers. Such inquiries may be fulfilled by the business customer providing\ninformation from its books and records to the corporation that demonstrates the\nrelevant information. (c) If, after\nexercising due diligence, the corporation has inadequate information to\ndetermine the location of the consumers, the corporation should determine the\nprimary use location or the location where the digital product or service is\nreceived based on the business customer. If, after exercising due diligence, the corporation has inadequate information to determine either the location of\neither the consumers or the business customer, the corporation then must use\nthe preceding taxable year method (see section\n4-3.9\nof this Subpart). (d) This section does not apply in instances\nwhere the business address presumption applies. In instances where the business\naddress presumption applies, the receipts shall be sourced to the billing\naddress of the business customer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n4-3.8\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
