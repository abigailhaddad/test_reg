  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 144.0 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n\nChapter 158 of the Laws of 1970 provides that employees in\nany title or individual position or positions who are entitled to time off with\npay for days observed as a holiday by New York State as an employer and who are\nrequired to work on such holidays may be granted additional compensation for\nsuch work pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Director of the Budget. The attendance rules for employees in New York State departments and\ninstitutions and the rules and regulations for overtime compensation, when\napplicable, should be considered in conjunction with these regulations. It is\nthe policy of the State that such work will be held to a minimum consistent\nwith the need to maintain essential services to the public. In no event will an\nemployee be entitled to holiday compensation pursuant to this Part unless such\nwork has been properly authorized. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n144.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
