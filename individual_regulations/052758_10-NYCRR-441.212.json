  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 441.212 - Net square feet\n\nState Regulations\n\nGross square feet of a building less common areas. To\ndetermine net square feet, the number of square feet in each cost center of the\nhospital may be determined either by a physical measurement of the hospital or\nby a measurement from blueprints. Floor area measurements should be taken from\nthe center of walls to the center of adjoining corridors if a hallway services\nmore than one cost center. Exclude stairwells, elevators, and other shafts, commonly used (lobbies, etc.) and idle areas. Idle areas are those areas that\nare closed off or unused for a period of time. Hallways, waiting rooms, storage\nareas, etc., serving only one cost center should be included in that cost\ncenter. The effect of using only usable space in the allocable floor area is to\nallocate the nonproductive space (commonly used and idle area) among the cost\ncenters in the ratio of space used. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n441.212\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
