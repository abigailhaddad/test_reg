  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.109 - Nominal wall thickness (t) for steel pipe\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If the nominal wall thickness for steel\npipe is not known, it is determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of\npipe at quarter points on one end. (b) However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and thickness and there are more than 10 lengths, only 10 percent of the\nindividual lengths, but not less than 10 lengths, need be measured. The\nthickness of the lengths that are not measured must be verified by applying a\ngauge set to the minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal wall\nthickness to be used in the design formula in section\n255.105\nof this Part is the next\nwall thickness found in a commercial specification that is below the average of\nall the measurements taken. However, the nominal wall thickness used may not be\nmore than 1.14 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe less than 20 inches\n(508 millimeters) in outside diameter, nor more than 1.11 times the smallest\nmeasurement taken on pipe 20 inches (508 millimeters) or more in outside\ndiameter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.109\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
