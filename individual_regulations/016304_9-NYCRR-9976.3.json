  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 9976.3 - Commission action\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon receipt of a request for an exemption from filing a financial disclosure\nstatement, the commission shall review the material filed to determine whether\nthe duties of the title or job classification include any disqualifying duties. If no further information is required, the commission shall render its decision\non the request. (b) If the\ncommission determines that additional information is necessary before making a\ndetermination, it may request the assistance of any employee or official of the\nmunicipality, and that employee or official shall furnish that assistance in a\ntimely manner. (c) (1)\n\nUpon a determination that the title or\njob classification does not involve the performance of disqualifying duties, the commission shall, if it determines it is in the public interest, grant the\nexemption on an individual, title, or job classification basis, as\nrequested. (2)\n\nUpon a determination\nthat the title or job classification does involve the performance of\ndisqualifying duties, the commission shall deny the request for an\nexemption. (3)\n\nWhere the commission\ndetermines that it is in the public interest to request that an individual file\nan annual statement, even though the duties may not exclude an exemption, the\ncommission may require the employee who serves in the title or job\nclassification to file a short-form financial disclosure statement, which shall\ncontain only that information which the commission determines is appropriate\nand necessary for that title or job classification. (d) The commission shall give written\nnotification of its determination to the requesting employee or employee\norganization or local agency, as appropriate. Any determination, other than a\ndetermination to grant the request, shall contain written findings of fact in\nsupport of the determination. (e) A\nrequest for an exemption does not extend the deadline for filing the annual\nstatement. The party requesting the exemption may, under compelling\ncircumstances, apply to the commission for an extension to submit an annual\nstatement until the exemption requested is acted upon by the commission. Only\nin special circumstances, as determined by the commission, will an extension\nfor submission of an annual statement be granted because of a pending exemption\nrequest. (f) Once an exemption is\ngranted, all employees covered by the exemption shall not be required to submit\nannual statements for subsequent years unless: (1)\nthe employee is appointed or promoted to\na new title or job classification for which filing is required; (2)\nthe duties of the title or job\nclassification change to include disqualifying duties; or\n(3)\nthe commission, upon review of its\ndetermination to grant the exemption, determines that the exemption is no\nlonger allowable under the law or this regulation or is no longer in the public\ninterest. However, no such determination shall be made without giving the\noriginal parties to the request an opportunity to submit written objections. In\naddition, any such determination shall be in writing and supported by written\nfindings of fact. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
