(28)\n\nSecondary stress means stress created in the pipe wall by loads other than\ninternal fluid pressure. For example, backfill loads, traffic loads, beam\naction in a span, loads at supports and at connections to the pipe. (29)\n\nService line means the piping, including\nassociated metering and pressure reducing appurtenances, that transports gas\nbelow grade from a main or transmission line to the outlet of the customer\nmeter or at the connection to a customer's piping, whichever is further\ndownstream where a meter is located within the building; if a meter is located\noutside the building, the service line will be deemed to terminate at the\noutside of the building foundation wall.
