Competent supervision includes awareness of and\nresponsibility for the ongoing activity of each child. It requires that all\nchildren be within a caregiver's range of vision except as provided in\nsubdivision (b) of this section and that the caregiver be near enough to\nrespond when redirection or intervention strategies are needed. Competent\nsupervision must take into account the child's age, emotional, physical and\ncognitive development. (b) Children\nmay be outside a caregiver's range of vision only as follows: (1)\n\nWith the prior written permission of the\nparent, children who are napping or sleeping may do so in a room where an awake\napproved caregiver is not present, the doors to all rooms must be open; the\napproved caregiver must remain on the same floor as the children; and a\nfunctioning electronic monitor must be used in any room where children are\nsleeping or napping and an awake approved caregiver is not present. (2)\n\nWhen a functioning electronic monitor is\nin use, napping and sleeping children must be physically checked every 15\nminutes to assess the overall safety and well-being of the children and to make\nsure infants' faces are uncovered. The checks must be done in close physical\nproximity to the child. (3)\n\nFor\nevening and night care, the caregiver may sleep while the children are sleeping\nonly if functional electronic monitors are in use in each room where children\nare sleeping. The licensee must obtain the written permission to do so from a\nparent of each child receiving evening or night care in the group family day\ncare home. In the event written permission is not obtained from all parents, the caregiver must remain awake at all times and physically check sleeping\nchildren every 15 minutes to assess the overall safety and well-being of the\nchildren and to make sure infants' faces are uncovered. The checks must be done\nin close physical proximity to the child. (4)\n\nChildren who are able to toilet\nindependently, including fastening and unfastening clothing, wiping themselves, flushing the toilet, and washing their hands, may use a bathroom on another\nfloor for a short period of time without direct adult supervision. (5)\n\nWith the written permission of the\nparents, a program may allow school-aged children to participate in activities\noutside of the direct supervision of a caregiver. Such activities must occur on\nthe premises of the group family day care home. A caregiver must visually check\nsuch children every 15 minutes. (c) Any electronic monitor or surveillance\nequipment used to take images, monitor or record children in day care may not\nbe used as a substitute for competent direct supervision of children. (d) Only approved caregivers may be left\nunsupervised with day care children. (e) The provider must be the primary\ncaregiver of children in a group family day care home. (f) The assistant(s) must also be caring for\nchildren whenever the numbers and ages of children in care dictate that an\nassistant be present. (g) The\nprovider may be absent for short or long term absences under the following\nconditions: (1)\n\nWhen the provider is absent\nfor three or fewer consecutive days, the office does not need to be notified in\nadvance; however the program must keep a written record of the caregiver\npresent in place of the absent provider. (2)\n\nWhen the provider is absent for more than\nthree consecutive days or has reason to be absent on a recurring basis, the\noffice must be notified in advance and the program must keep a written record\nof the caregiver present in place of the absent provider. (h) With written office approval, an approved\nassistant will be permitted to work in place of the provider for long-term\nabsences for up to a total of 30 cumulative days per year. (i) In other than emergency situations such\nas illness or accident, parents must be notified in writing two weeks prior to\nany long-term absence of the provider. This notice must include specific start\nand end dates of the absence and who will be taking the provider's place in the\nday care program. (j) Supervision ratios. (1)\n\nOne\ncaregiver may care for a maximum of six children younger than school age, or\neight children when at least two of the eight children are school\naged. (2)\n\nTwo caregivers must be\npresent when more than six children, none of whom are school age, are in\ncare. (3)\n\nWhen care is provided for\nchildren under the age of two years, there must be at least one caregiver\npresent for every two children under the age of two years in\nattendance. (4)\n\nFor the purposes of\noff-site activities or transportation, if the group of children is divided, the\nratio requirements must be maintained. (k) A provider must be approved by the office\nor its representatives prior to assuming the role in any group family day care\nprogram. (l) [\nReserved\n]\n(m) The\nuse of any type of device for social or entertainment purposes, listening to\nmusic on headphones, playing screen games, using the internet, or making\npersonal calls by caregivers while supervising children is prohibited.
