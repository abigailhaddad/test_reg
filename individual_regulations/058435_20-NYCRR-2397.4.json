  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2397.4 - Payment methods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Taxpayers electing ACH debit. (1)\n\nTaxpayers\nwho are participating in the program who elect the ACH debit payment option\nmust, on or before 6:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the last business day before the\napplicable due date, report their tax payment for the applicable period by\ntelephone or through the program's website to the electronic payment reporting\nsystem. (This is the case because there is a one-day lag between the date on\nwhich payment is authorized and the date on which the transfer is executed; i.e., funds are deducted from the taxpayer's bank account and transferred to\nthe department's depository bank.) The electronic payment reporting system can\nbe accessed using the toll-free number or through the program's website. Information on both methods will be provided to taxpayers as part of the\nnotification and enrollment process. (2)\n(i) Prior to making its first payment of tax by ACH debit, a taxpayer must have\nfurnished the department with the banking information necessary to generate ACH\ndebits against its designated account. If a taxpayer's banking information\nchanges after the first payment, the taxpayer must immediately inform the\ndepartment of the changes to ensure timely payments. The method of changing\ninformation will be described in the program materials. (ii)\n\nUpon reaching the electronic payment\nreporting system, the taxpayer will be asked for the unique password and access\ncode provided to such taxpayer as part of the notification and enrollment\nprocess. The password, access code, identity of the taxpayer and choice of\npayment option will be verified, and after approval, the taxpayer will be\ngranted access to the electronic payment reporting system. Upon accessing such\nsystem, the taxpayer will be asked to report the following information: (a) payment amount; (b) taxable period; and\n(c) such other information as the department\ndeems necessary for filing and payment reporting purposes. If the taxpayer reports the above-enumerated information is\nreported by telephone, the information will be verified over the telephone. If\nthe information is reported using the program's website, it will be verified by\nthe taxpayer online. Once the taxpayer agrees that all information reported is\ncorrect, the taxpayer will be given a confirmation number for the\ntransaction. (iii)\n\nSuccessful completion of the reporting\nof the required information to the electronic payment reporting system\nfunctions as an authorization for the payment of tax to be transferred to the\ndepartment's depository bank. (3)\n\nIf a taxpayer utilizing the ACH debit\npayment option is not remitting a payment of tax for an applicable period, the\ntaxpayer must, on or before 6:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the last business day\nbefore the applicable due date, access the electronic payment reporting system\nto report a zero remittance for such period. (b) Taxpayers electing ACH credit or fedwire. (1)\n\nTaxpayers who are participating in the\nprogram who elect the ACH credit or fedwire payment option must initiate each\npayment of tax by contacting their own financial institution and requesting\nsuch institution to transfer both the appropriate payment of tax and the\nnecessary addenda record information to the department's depository bank via an\nACH credit or a fedwire transfer, as applicable. An ACH credit taxpayer must\ninitiate each payment transaction with its financial institution on or before\nthe last business day before the applicable due date at such time as designated\nby its bank to assure that the department's depository bank receives the\npayment and accompanying addenda record information on or before the applicable\ndue date. A fedwire taxpayer must initiate each payment transaction on or\nbefore the applicable due date at such time as designated by its bank to assure\nthat the department's depository bank receives the payment and accompanying\naddenda record information on or before the applicable due date. (2)\n\nTaxpayers utilizing the ACH credit or\nfedwire payment option need not access the electronic payment reporting system\nto initiate a payment of tax for a taxable period. However, if such a taxpayer\nis not remitting a payment of tax for an applicable period, the taxpayer must, on or before 6:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the last business day before the\napplicable due date, access the electronic payment reporting system to report a\nzero remittance for such period. (c) General EFT payment rule. Any payment of\ntax made by utilizing the ACH debit, ACH credit or fedwire payment option is\ndeemed to be made on the date payment is received by the department's\ndepository bank. (d) Taxpayers\nelecting to pay by certified check. (1)\n\nTaxpayers who are participating in the program and who do not elect the ACH\ndebit, ACH credit or fedwire method of payment, shall be required to make\npayments of tax by certified check in accordance with the provisions of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nIn order to comply with the requirements\nof the program and to timely make a payment of tax, a taxpayer electing the\ncertified check payment option must either mail the certified check for the\namount of the payment of tax and a completed transmittal form prescribed by the\ndepartment on or before the second business day prior to the applicable due\ndate or assure that the department's depository bank receives the certified\ncheck and the completed transmittal form on or before the applicable due\ndate. (3)\n\nIf a taxpayer electing\nthe certified check payment option is not remitting a payment of tax for an\napplicable period, the taxpayer must either timely mail the completed\ntransmittal form prescribed by the department entering thereon a zero total\npayment of tax or assure that the department's depository bank receives such\ncompleted transmittal form showing the zero total payment of tax on or before\nthe applicable due date. (e) Acknowledgement of payment. To provide an\nacknowledgement of payment, the department will post a record of deposits to\nthe taxpayer's online account which can be accessed through the program's\nwebsite. Taxpayers may also request that the department mail an advice of\ndeposit or payment. Information will be provided by the program to\nparticipating taxpayers at the time of enrollment about how taxpayers may\nchoose to have an advice of deposit or payment mailed to them. (f) Correcting mistakes in payments of tax. If a taxpayer does not make a correct payment of tax for a particular period, such taxpayer shall, on the nearest business day to the date on which the error\nis discovered, make proper adjustment for such period. Information will be\nprovided by the program about how to make this adjustment. If the taxpayer's\nerror involves an underpayment of tax, interest shall be charged and penalties\nmay apply. (g) Changing payment\noption. Taxpayers may elect to change their payment option at any time. The\ndepartment will make the methods of electing to change payment option available\nto taxpayers in the printed program description or on the program's\nwebsite. (h) Payment contingency\noptions for use in emergency situations. If a taxpayer is unable to utilize its\nchosen payment option for a particular period due to circumstances beyond its\ncontrol, such taxpayer may utilize any of the other payment options, excluding\nACH debit, as an alternative payment mechanism for such period. The procedures\nspecified in subdivision (b) or (d) of this section, as applicable, shall\ngovern in such cases. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
