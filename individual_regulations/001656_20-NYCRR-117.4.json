  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 117.4 - Character of items\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 617(b)\n(a) In order that the modifications may be\nproperly applied to partnership items of income, gain, loss or deduction, whenever applicable, each of such partnership items must have the same\ncharacter for a partner under the New York State personal income tax law as for\n\nFederal income tax purposes. Where an item is not characterized for Federal\nincome tax purposes, the item must have the same character for a partner as if\nrealized directly from the source from which realized by the partnership or\nincurred in the same manner as incurred by the partnership. If a partnership\nitem is not required to be taken into account for Federal income tax purposes\n(such as interest on bonds of the State of California), the character of the\nitem for a partner for New York State personal income tax purposes is the same\nas if such partner had realized or incurred the item directly. (b) Where a partner is a member in a\npartnership, and such partnership (hereinafter referred to as the \"upper tier\npartnership\") is a partner in another partnership (hereinafter referred to as\nthe \" lower tier partnership\"), the character of such member' s distributive\nshare of each partnership item of the upper tier partnership which is\nattributable to the lower tier partnership retains the character determined at\nthe level of the lower tier partnership using the provisions of subdivision (a)\nof this section. Such character is not changed by reason of the fact that such\nitem flows through the upper tier partnership to such member. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n117.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
