Tit. 10 § 80.18 - Security standards; public warehouse and common or contract carriers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Licensees who store controlled substances in a public warehouse are responsible for utilizing a warehouse that will provide adequate security against theft or diversion. The licensee and not the warehouse is responsible for the security of the controlled substances. The department shall determine if the overall security is adequate. The licensee shall notify the department in writing within 30 days of any change in the warehouse inspected and approved by the department. (b) The licensees are also responsible for utilizing a common or contract carrier that will provide adequate security of the controlled substances while they are in transit. If the licensee has substantial quantities of controlled substances lost or stolen in transit when utilizing the facilities of a particular common or contract carrier, steps shall be taken to obtain another carrier or means of transportation for shipping controlled substances. Precautions such as securely wrapping and sealing packages containing controlled substances or utilizing unmarked or coded boxes or shipping containers are required for guarding against losses in storage or in transit.
