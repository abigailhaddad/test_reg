  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 1100-2.15 - Exhibit 14: Wetlands\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 14 shall contain: (a) A map or series of maps showing\njurisdictional boundaries of all federal, state and locally regulated wetlands\nand adjacent areas present on the facility site and within one hundred (100)\nfeet of areas to be disturbed by construction, including the interconnections, as determined by the Office pursuant to section 1100-1.3(e) of this Part, and\nprovide federal jurisdictional determination, if available. For adjacent\nproperties without accessibility, initial surveys may be based on\nremote-sensing data, interpretation of existing wetlands and soils mapping, observation from adjacent accessible properties, and current and historical\naerial imagery. (b) Any reports\ndetailing the results of the delineation survey(s). (c) A qualitative and descriptive wetland\nfunctional assessment, including seasonal variations, for all delineated\nwetlands that would be impacted for groundwater recharge/discharge, flood flow\nalteration, fish and shellfish habitat, sediment/toxicant retention, nutrient\nremoval, sediment/shoreline stabilization, wildlife habitat, recreation, uniqueness/heritage, visual quality/aesthetics, and protected species\nhabitat. (d) An analysis of all\noff-site wetlands within one hundred (100) feet beyond the limit of disturbance\nthat may be hydrologically or ecologically influenced by development of the\nfacility and the wetlands identified on the map required by subdivision (a) of\nthis section, observed in the field where accessible to determine their general\ncharacteristics and relationship, if any, to delineated wetlands. (e) If the Office has determined pursuant to\nsection 1100-1.3(e) of this Part that there are jurisdictional wetlands at the\nsite, a demonstration of avoidance of impacts to such wetlands and their one\nhundred (100)-foot adjacent areas by siting all components more than one\nhundred (100) feet from any delineated NYS wetlands. (f) If the applicant cannot avoid impacts to\nall wetlands and adjacent areas, an explanation of all efforts the applicant\nmade to minimize the impacts to wetlands and adjacent areas identified during\nwetland surveys. The impact minimization summary shall address the following\ncriteria for each proposed impact area: (1)\n\nWhy the facility design and siting cannot avoid NYS wetlands and adjacent\nareas, as applicable; (2)\n\nHow the\nfacility design has minimized proposed impacts to NYS wetlands and adjacent\nareas, as applicable; (3)\n\nHow the\nfacility design and siting minimize impacts to NYS wetlands, or portions of the\nwetlands, and the function and values currently provided by these wetlands; and\n(4)\n\nHow the facility design and\nsiting will maximize and/or improve the function and values provided by the\nremaining adjacent areas surrounding the NYS wetlands. (g) For facilities for which compensatory\nmitigation is required in Table 1, unless determined otherwise by the Office in\nconsultation with the NYSDEC, the applicant shall submit a Wetland Restoration\nand Mitigation Plan pursuant to section 1100-10.2(f)(2) of this Part, in\naccordance with the following: (1)\n\nPurchase of\nexisting wetland mitigation bank credits for unavoidable wetland impacts\nwherever there is an existing wetland mitigation bank with a service area that\nincludes the location of the facility. The purchase of mitigation banking\ncredits shall occur within the same HUC 8 Watershed within which the facility\nis located; or\n(2)\n\nImplement\napplicant-responsible wetland and/or adjacent area mitigation at the ratios as\nset forth in Table 1 below as follows, unless determined otherwise by the\n\nOffice in consultation with the NYSDEC: (i) Category: Prescribed mitigation ratio & type\n(a) X: Not an allowable feature or\nactivity. (b) A: Allowed; no\nmitigation or enhancement required. (c) A(M1): Allowed, mitigation required (3:1\nmitigation ratio by area of impact - creation only, broken down by cover\ntype)\n(d) A(M2): Allowed, mitigation required (2:1 mitigation ratio by area of impact - creation, restoration, and enhancement)\n(e) A(M3): Allowed, mitigation required (1:1 mitigation ratio by area of impact -\ncreation, restoration and enhancement)\n(f) A(E): Allowed, enhancements and/or\nmitigation required (e.g., planting of adjacent area, mitigating hydrological\nchanges)\n(ii)\n\nWithin the\nsame HUC 8 sub-basin; and\n(iii)\n\nWithin a location that is subject to NYSDEC jurisdiction under ECL article 24, which includes the following: (a) Contiguous\nwith an existing NYS-regulated wetland; or\n(b) Within fifty (50) meters (one hundred\nsixty-four (164) feet) of an existing NYS-regulated wetland; (iv)\n\nWhere creation, enhancement, and restoration mean the following: (a) Creation, in cases of activities requiring fill, means making a new wetland or\nexpanding an existing wetland in lands that were not previously occupied by a\nwetland. Creation, in cases of activities not requiring fill, can include\nplanting trees and/or shrubs in an existing wetland currently devoid of trees\nand shrubs. (b) Restoration means\nreclaiming a degraded wetland or adjacent area to bring back one or more\nfunctions that have been partially or completely lost. (c) Enhancement means altering an existing\nfunctional wetland or adjacent area to increase selected functions and benefits\nthat offsets losses of these functions or benefits in another wetland or\nadjacent area or parts of the same wetland or adjacent area. (3)\n\nImplement a\ncombination of the mitigation required pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of\nthis subdivision to meet the mitigation requirement.
