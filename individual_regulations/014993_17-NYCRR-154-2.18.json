  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 §§ 154-2.18 - Excess or banked weight capacity (F4, F5 and F6 only)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The banked capacity for a registered\nowner must have been established with the department prior to January 1, 1988. The banked weight capacity for a vehicle(s) is the weight for which the vehicle\nwas permitted at the time banked weight capacity was established. The banked\nweight capacity will be maintained in an account for each registered owner. The\nbanked capacity shall be established by a single vehicle or the power unit of a\ncombination of vehicles and not by the trailers. (b) Excess weight capacity arises from one or\nmore of the four following situations: (1)\na\nreplacement vehicle having a gross vehicle weight less than the banked weight\ncapacity of the replaced vehicle; or\n(2)\nby the statutory reduction in maximum\nweights or phasing out of a permit type under the F4, or F5 permit over the\nphase-down period; or\n(3)\nthe\ndifference in weight between two or more permit types when the higher weight\npermit(s) is surrendered. If this is done the grandfather weight will be\nreduced to the new permit level; or\n(4)\nthe voluntary surrender of a permit to be\ncredited to a company's excess banked weight. Once this permit weight is\nsurrendered, this vehicle can no longer obtain a permit under this same\naccount. (c) The excess\nweight capacity can only be used to justify the acquisition of additional\nvehicle(s) as replacement vehicles. (d) The gross weight capacity of the\nreplacement vehicle or combination of vehicles shall not exceed the gross\nweight capacity of the replaced vehicle or combination of vehicles. Therefore, unused banked weight capacity (excess weight capacity) cannot justify a\nreplacement vehicle which has a gross weight capacity greater than the replaced\nvehicle. (e) If a permit is revoked\npursuant to this Part, the excess or banked weight capacity of the permitted\nvehicle shall be adjusted to reflect the weight loadings which should be\ncarried by the permitted vehicle.
