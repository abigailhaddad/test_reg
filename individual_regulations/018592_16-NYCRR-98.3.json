Tit. 16 § 98.3 - Charges for providing additional facilities and for acquiring rights-of-way\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If, in order to\nprovide nonresidential service or residential service to a non-residing\napplicant, a utility must install or provide for the installation of\ndistribution lines, service lines and appurtenant facilities, in addition to\nthose required to be provided without contribution under section\n98.2\nof this Part, the utility\nshall impose a lump-sum charge on the applicant for such facilities that exceed\nthe portion which the utility is required to provide without contribution to\nthe applicant. For a nonresiding applicant in a residential subdivision\nrequiring underground service, this lump-sum charge shall be determined by\nsubtracting the total free footage allowance from the total footage of\ndistribution line, service line and appurtenant facilities (other than those\naccounted for in accounts 368 and 370) to be installed and multiplying the\nremaining distribution and service footage by the applicable experienced\naverage cost per foot of the installing utility as reported pursuant to section\n98.6\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Part and set forth in the utility's tariff. For an applicant for\nnonresidential service or for a nonresiding applicant not in a residential\nsubdivision requiring underground service, the lump-sum charge relating to\ndistribution lines, service lines and appurtenant facilities (other than those\naccounted for in accounts 368 and 370) shall be determined as set forth in the\nutility's tariff. (b) If, in order\nto provide service to a residing applicant, a utility must install or provide\nfor the installation of a distribution line, a service line and appurtenant\nfacilities (other than those accounted for in accounts 368 and 370) in addition\nto those required to be provided without contribution under section\n98.2\nof this Part, the utility\nshall impose a lump-sum charge or a charge subject to the provisions in\nsubdivision (e) of this section, at the option of the applicant. For a residing\napplicant, the lump-sum charge relating to a distribution line, a service line\nand appurtenant facilities (other than those accounted for in accounts 368 and\n370) shall be determined as set forth in the utility's tariff. (c) If an applicant for nonresidential\nservice or a nonresiding applicant chooses, pursuant to section\n98.2\n(b)(1)(ii)\nof\nthis Part, to pay a utility for acquiring the necessary R/W, the utility shall\nimpose a lump-sum charge on the applicant to cover the reasonable actual costs\nof acquiring such R/W. (d) If a\nresiding applicant chooses pursuant to section\n98.2\n(b)(1)(ii)\nof\nthis Part to pay a utility for acquiring the necessary R/W, the utility shall\nimpose on the applicant either a lump-sum charge or a charge subject to the\nprovisions of subdivision (e) of this section, at the applicant's option, to\ncover the reasonable actual costs of acquiring such R/W. (e) If a residing applicant has chosen not to\npay a lump-sum amount, a utility shall impose a surcharge relating to the\nmaterial and installation costs of distribution lines, service lines, and\nappurtenant facilities (other than those accounted for in Accounts 368 and 370)\nand to R/W acquisition costs, subject to the following provisions: (1)\nthe surcharge shall be applicable for 10\nyears, shall be computed as specified in individual utility tariffs approved by\nthe commission and shall be paid annually or rateably for each billing\nperiod; (2)\nif more than one\ncustomer is to be served from new overhead distribution lines and the length of\nthe lines requested exceeds such customers' aggregate entitlement (that is, the\nnumber of customers multiplied by 500 feet or 300 feet -- for single-phase and\nthree-phase service, respectively) the excess length shall be prorated among\nthe customers for purposes of calculating the surcharge in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision; (3)\nafter the\ncommencement of service from a new overhead distribution line whenever the\naggregate entitlement of the customers then served from the line (that is, the\nnumber of customers multiplied by 500 feet or 300 feet -- for single-phase and\nthree-phase service, respectively) equals or exceeds the length of the\ndistribution line initially constructed, the surcharge shall terminate as to\nall customers served from the distribution line; (4)\nwhenever the total revenue in each of any\ntwo consecutive calendar years from all customers served from a new overhead\ndistribution line exceeds 1.5 times the reasonable actual capital cost of the\ntotal distribution line, all surcharges shall cease; (5)\nno surcharges shall be imposed if the\ntotal estimated revenue in each of any two consecutive calendar years from all\ncustomers served from a new distribution line exceeds 1.5 times the reasonable\nactual capital costs of the total distribution line; and\n(6)\ncustomers who are currently paying a\nsurcharge may, at their option convert to a 10-year surcharge, with years and\namounts already paid credited, or be relieved of their surcharge, if their\npayments meet or exceed the installation costs of their facilities. (f) If an applicant on whom a\nutility has imposed a surcharge, in accordance with subdivision (e) of this\nsection, changes his or her ownership of the residence after the imposition of\nsuch surcharge, the utility may collect the remainder of the surcharge from any\nnew successor owner provided the utility provides in its surcharge agreement in\nbold face type: APPLICANT HEREBY AGREES TO INFORM ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF\nTHIS PROPERTY THAT A UTILITY SURCHARGE IS IN EFFECT. (g) If facilities are extended to provide\nservice to a residing applicant who pays a lump-sum charge pursuant to\nsubdivision (b) of this section, and other applicants subsequently take service\nfrom such facilities within 10 years, the first residing applicant shall\nreceive a refund in accordance with each utility's tariff. (h) If a nonresiding applicant has paid a\nlump-sum charge pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section and if, after the\nunderground distribution system construction is completed, additional dwelling\nunits are constructed and take service from such system within the residential\nsubdivision boundaries as defined on the map submitted pursuant to section\n98.2\n(d) of this\n\nPart, the utility shall recalculate the charge paid pursuant to subdivision (a)\nof this section as if the additional dwelling unit(s) had been constructed at\nthe time of the utility's original construction within the residential\nsubdivision and make an appropriate refund of such charge without interest. Any\nportion of the charge remaining unrefunded five years after the date on which\nthe utility is first ready to render service from the distribution system shall\nbe retained by the utility and credited to the appropriate plant\naccounts. (i) Where a residing\napplicant has chosen to pay a surcharge pursuant to subdivision (b) of this\nsection, such applicant shall at any time, have the option of paying the\noutstanding balance in a lump sum.
