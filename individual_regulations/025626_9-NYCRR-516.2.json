  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 516.2 - Jurisdiction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Jurisdiction in\ngeneral. (1)\n\nNature of courts-martial\njurisdiction. (i) The jurisdiction of\ncourts-martial is entirely penal or disciplinary. (ii)\n\nThis code applies in all places within\nthe State. It also applies to all persons subject to the code while serving\noutside the State and applies while such persons are going to and returning\nfrom such service outside the State in like manner and to the same extent as\nwhile those persons are serving within the State (see ML, 130.5[a]). (iii)\n\nThe jurisdiction of a court-martial\nwith respect to offenses under the code is not affected by the place where the\ncourt-martial sits (see ML, 130.5 [b]). (2)\n\nRequisites of court-martial jurisdiction. A court-martial always has jurisdiction to determine whether it has\njurisdiction. Otherwise for a court-martial to have jurisdiction: (i) the court-martial must be convened by an\nofficial empowered to convene it (see ML, 130.22, in the case of a general\ncourt-martial; ML 130.23, in the case of a special court-martial, and ML, 130.24 and Part 515 of this Title, in the case of a summary court-martial); and\n(ii)\nthe court-martial must be\ncomposed in accordance with these rules with respect to number and\nqualifications of its personnel (see ML, 130.16). As used here, personnel\nincludes only the military judge, the members, and the summary court-martial\nofficer; and\n(iii)\neach charge\nbefore the court-martial must be referred to it by competent authority (see ML, 130.34); and\n(iv)\nthe accused must\nbe a person subject to court-martial jurisdiction (see ML, 130.2); and\n(v) the offense must be subject\nto court-martial jurisdiction (see ML, 130.34 and ML, 130.73 to 115). (3)\n\nContempt. A court-martial may\npunish for contempt any person who uses any menacing word, sign, or gesture in\nits presence, or who disturbs its proceedings by any riot or disorder. The\npunishment may not exceed confinement for 30 days or a fine of $100, or both. (see ML, 130.48). (4)\n\nExclusive and\nnonexclusive jurisdiction. (i) Courts-martial\nhave exclusive jurisdiction of purely military offenses. (ii)\n\nAn act or omission which violates both\nthe code and local criminal law, foreign or domestic, may be tried by a\ncourt-martial, or by a proper civilian tribunal. (iii)\n\nWhere an act or omission is subject to\ntrial by court-martial and by one or more civil tribunals, the determination of\nwhich tribunal within the State, or the United States will exercise\njurisdiction is a matter for the State, the United States, or the municipality\nconcerned, and is not a right of the suspect or accused. (5)\n\nReciprocal jurisdiction. (i) Each armed force has court-martial\njurisdiction over all persons subject to the code (ML, 130.17 and\n130.2). (ii)\nA member of one armed\nforce may be tried by a court-martial convened by a member of another armed\nforce when the accused cannot be delivered to the armed force of which the\naccused is a member without manifest injury to the organized militia. An\naccused should not ordinarily be tried by a court-martial convened by a member\nof a different component of the organized militia except when the above\ncircumstances exist. However, failure to comply with this policy does not\naffect an otherwise valid referral. (iii)\n\nNothing in this subdivision prohibits\ndetailing to a court-martial military judge who is a member of a component of\nthe organized militia different from that of the accused or the convening\nauthority, or both. (iv)\n\nIn all\ncases, review after that by the officer with authority to convene a general\ncourt-martial for the command which held the trial, where that review is\nrequired by the code, must be carried out by the component of the organized\nmilitia of which the accused is a member. (6)\n\nTypes of courts-martial. (i) General courts-martial. Subject to\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision, general courts-martial may try any person\nsubject to the code for any offense made punishable by the code. Upon a finding\nof guilty of an offense made punishable by the code, general courts-martial may\nadjudge any punishment authorized under ML, 130.18. (ii)\n\nSpecial courts-martial. Subject to\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision, special courts-martial may try any person\nsubject to the code except commissioned officers (see  title 32, United States Code, section\n328\n)  title 32, United States Code, section\n328\n) for any offense\nmade punishable by the code. Upon a finding of guilty, special courts-martial\nmay adjudge any punishable authorized under ML, 130.19. A bad conduct discharge\ncannot be adjudged unless a complete record of the proceedings and testimony\nbefore the court has been made. (iii)\n\nSummary courts-martial (see N.Y.R.C.M. 1301[c] and [d] [1]). (7)\n\nConcurrent jurisdiction of other military\ntribunals. The provisions of the code and this Chapter conferring jurisdiction\nupon courts-martial do not deprive military commissions, provost courts, or\nother military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders\nor offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military\ncommissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals (see ML, 130.12). (b) Persons\nsubject to the jurisdiction of courts-martial. (1)\n\nIn general. Courts-martial may try any\nperson when authorized to do so under the code (see ML, 130.2). (2)\n\nAttachment of jurisdiction over the\nperson. (i) In general. Court-martial\njurisdiction attaches over a person when action with a view to trial of that\nperson is taken. Once court-martial jurisdiction attaches, such jurisdiction\nshall continue for all purposes of trial, sentence and punishment, notwithstanding the expiration of that person's term of service or other period\nin which that person was subject to the code or trial by\ncourt-martial. (ii)\n\nProcedure. Actions by which court-martial jurisdiction attaches include: apprehension; imposition of restraint, such as restriction, arrest, or confinement and\nreferral of charges. (c) Jurisdiction over the offense. To the\nextent permitted by the United States or New York State Constitutions, courts-martial may try any offense under the code. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
