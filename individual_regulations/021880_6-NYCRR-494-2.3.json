  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 494-2.3 - Leak Detection and Monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Starting on the effective date of this Part, any owner or operator of\nrefrigeration or air conditioning equipment in the subsectors listed in section\n494-1.4 of this Part that exceeds the compliance threshold indicated in the\nfollowing table and is operated year-round, must conduct the following leak\nmanagement protocols in accordance with the frequency specified. Equipment Size\n\nRegulated Equipment Compliance\n\nThreshold\n\nLeak Detection Protocol\n\nLarge - Refrigeration Equipment\n\nRefrigerant charge capacity of 1,500 pounds or\ngreater\n\nMonthly leak inspection, to be replaced with an\nautomatic leak detection system on or before June 1, 2025 or within 30 days of\ninstallation of new equipment. Large - Air Conditioning\n\nEquipment\n\nRefrigerant charge capacity of 1,500 pounds or\ngreater\n\nMonthly leak inspection or install an automatic\nleak detection system. Medium\n\nRefrigerant charge capacity of 200 to 1,499\npounds\n\nQuarterly leak inspection or install an\nautomatic leak detection system. Small\n\nRefrigerant charge capacity of 50 to 199\npounds\n\nAnnual leak inspection or install an automatic\nleak detection system. (b) Leak inspections must be conducted by the\nowner or operator of the regulated equipment outlined in subdivision (a) of\nthis section using a calibrated leak detection device or bubble test at the\nfollowing intervals and under these conditions: (1)\nat the frequency outlined in subdivision\n(a) of this section; (2)\nwhen\nadding additional regulated substance amounts equal to or greater than five (5)\npounds or one (1) percent of the refrigerant charge capacity of the regulated\nequipment; and\n(3)\nwhen oily\nresidue is observed on any refrigerant circuit indicating a refrigerant\nleak. (c) Leak detection\ndevices must be calibrated to accurately detect and measure the ambient\nconcentration of regulated substances at a minimum concentration level of 10\nparts per million of vapor of the specific regulated substance(s) used in the\nregulated equipment. Additionally, all visible and accessible components of a\nrefrigerant-containing appliance must be inspected, with the following\nexceptions: (i) where components are\ninsulated, under ice that forms on the outside of equipment, underground, behind walls, or are otherwise inaccessible; (ii)\nwhere personnel must be elevated more\nthan two meters above a support surface; or\n(iii)\nwhere components are unsafe to inspect, as determined by site personnel. (d) Monthly, quarterly, and annual leak\ninspections are not required for regulated equipment or portions of regulated\nequipment continuously monitored by an automatic leak detection system that\nmeets the following requirements. Automatic leak detection systems required by\nsubdivision (a) of this section must be installed by owners or operators to\nmeet the following requirements. (1)\n\nFor\nautomatic leak detection systems that detect the presence of a regulated\nsubstance in the air, the system must be annually audited and calibrated using\nthe manufacturer-recommended procedures so that it accurately detects a\nconcentration level of 10 parts per million of vapor of the specific regulated\nsubstance(s) used in the regulated equipment and alerts the operator when a\nconcentration of 100 parts per million of vapor of the regulated substance(s)\nis reached. The sensors or intakes shall be placed so that they will\ncontinuously monitor the refrigerant concentrations in air in proximity to the\ncompressor, evaporator, condenser, and other areas with a high potential for a\nrefrigerant leak. (2)\n\nFor an\nautomatic leak detection system that interprets measurements to indicate a\nleak, the automatic leak detection system must be annually audited and\ncalibrated using manufacturer recommended procedures so that it will alert the\nowner or operator when measurements indicate a loss of 50 pounds of refrigerant\nor 10 percent of the equipment's full refrigerant charge capacity, whichever is\nless. (3)\n\nIf an automatic leak\ndetection system detects a leak, the owner or operator must perform a leak\ninspection on the system within 24 hours of the leak detection. The leak\ninspection must be conducted using a calibrated leak detection device or a\nbubble test to confirm a refrigerant leak and determine the location. (4)\n\nWhen an automatic leak detection system\nis only being used to monitor portions of a regulated equipment system, the\nremainder of the equipment continues to be subject to any applicable leak\ninspection requirements. (5)\n\nWhere\nan automatic leak detection system is required per subdivision (a) of this\nsection, the entirety of the regulated equipment system must be monitored by an\nautomatic leak detection system. (e) For regulated equipment listed in\nsubdivision (a) of this section that is not operated year-round, the owner or\noperator must conduct a leak inspection within 30 days after starting each\noperation, and once every three months thereafter until the regulated equipment\nis shut down. The leak inspection must be conducted using a calibrated leak\ndetection device or bubble test. (f) The requirements of this section do not\napply during the time that regulated equipment is undergoing mothballing. The\nrequirements of this section apply on the day the regulated equipment resumes\noperation after mothballing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
