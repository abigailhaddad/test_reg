  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-5.4 - Partial payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Payments on account of contracts included in the scope of this Subpart shall be\nmade in accordance with the terms of the contract. Such terms may prescribe the\nform in which the contractor's claim for payment is to be submitted, the\nretention by the local agency, until the final payment is made of fixed\npercentages of the claim, etc. No partial payments may be made after the time\nfixed in the contract for the full and final completion of the work, as\nextended by change orders has expired unless the contract has been amended and\nthe prior approval of the commissioner to the making of the partial payment has\nbeen obtained in accordance with such amendment. The State's construction\nadviser is not authorized to give approvals under such circumstances. (b) Generally speaking, claims for partial\npayments on account of the contracts included in the scope of this Subpart will\nbe submitted in either of the following forms: (1)\n\nPeriodical estimate for partial payments. This is a printed form supplied by the division (form\nDH-356) and is shown as Exhibits 13 and 14 of Appendix S-11. Claims for partial\npayments under most construction contracts included in the 1460, Structures, Equipment and Improvements, group of development cost accounts will be\nsubmitted on this form. All periodical estimates for partial payments require\nthe prior written approval of the State's construction adviser. Preparation of\nthe periodical estimate for partial payment, and of the supporting documents\nrequired in connection therewith, is described in section\n1646-5.6. (2)\n\nContractor's invoices. When a contractor's claim for a partial payment is not\nrequired to be submitted in the form of a Periodical Estimate for Partial\n\nPayment (form DH-356), it will ordinarily take the form of the contractor's\ninvoice. The processing of an invoice and the documents required to support the\naccounts payable voucher drawn therefor are described in section\n1642-2.4\n(subd. [c], par. [2], subpar. [iii]). All partial payments on contracts included in the scope of this\n\nSubpart, based on invoices, require the prior written approval of the division\nor the State's construction adviser, depending on the type of contract. Such\napproval may be in the form of a letter or an endorsement of the invoice and\nshall be attached to the accounts payable voucher. (c) Assuming that the approved claim for\npartial payment of a plumbing contractor, holding a contract in the adjusted\namount of $100,000, is for $30,000, which includes a net allowance of $5,000\nfor materials stored on the site, (see §\n1646-5.6, subd. [f]) and that 10\nper cent is to be retained on the gross value of the work performed, the\nfollowing entry would be made from the accounts payable voucher. Entry (2): Debit: Account 1460.2, Plumbing\n$30,000.00\n\nCredit: Account 1111, Development Fund\n$27,500.00\n\nCredit: Account 2112, Contract Retentions\n$ 2,500.00\n\nDebit: Account 2400, Contract Awards\n$30,000.00\n\nCredit: Account 1150, Incompleted Contracts\n$30,000.00\n(d) In the entry recording the payment of the\ncontractor's claim in the contractor's ledger (see Exhibit 19, Appendix S-8), the\ntotal value of the work performed\nis the sum of the amount\nadvanced for materials stored, the net amount paid on account of the contract\nitself (after deduction for contract retention) and of the amount of the\ncontract retention. The support for the above entry in the contractor's ledger\nshall be the approved periodical estimate for partial payment. No accrual is to\nbe made for work performed under contract in the current quarter, and remaining\nunpaid as of the end of the quarter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-5.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
