  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.113 - Executive Order No. 113: Directing the State Committee on Geographic Names to establish a procedure to identify and eliminate problem names from all State maps. [*]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, racial, ethnic, religious and other epithets are\noffensive, and obnoxious and an insult to the individual dignity and humanity\nof those to whom they are applied; WHEREAS, such derogatory names are especially offensive\nwhen applied to geographic places or used in any way that might connote\ngovernmental approval or acquiescence; WHEREAS, section\n174\nof the\n\nEducation Law authorizes the Board of Regents to establish within the Education\n\nDepartment, a unit which is charged to \"determine and establish the correct\nhistorical and etymological form of the place names in this State and recommend\nthe adoption of such correct forms for public use\", and the Board of Regents\nhas established the State Committee on Geographic Names which is willing to\nwork with localities and other State agencies to rename places which are\ndetermined to have derogatory names; WHEREAS, there are State agencies, authorities and other\nentities which are responsible for preparing maps of the State or portions\nthereof; WHEREAS, it is therefore appropriate for the State entities\nresponsible for mapping to cooperate with the State Committee on Geographic\n\nNames in order to rid State maps of all derogatory place names. NOW, THEREFORE, I, MARIO M. CUOMO, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby direct that no map prepared by or for any\ndivision of the Executive Department or any other department of the State shall\ncontain any derogatory racial, ethnic or religious name or other epithet and no\nuse shall be made of any such derogatory name, except to bring about renaming, pending immediate action to replace the derogatory name in the manner\nhereinafter provided. Further, I direct each division within the Executive\n\nDepartment and all other departments of the State which become aware of any\nderogatory place name to immediately refer such information to the State\n\nCommittee on Geographic Names and to cease using such derogatory name pending\nthe adoption of a replacement name. Further, I direct each division within the Executive\n\nDepartment and all other departments of the State which have mapping\nresponsibilities to meet promptly with the State Committee on Geographic Names\nto establish a procedure to identify and eliminate problem names from all State\nmaps. As part of such procedure, each department or division shall, in any\nrevision or review of existing maps and the development of new maps, identify\nany derogatory place names on maps prepared by or for such division or\ndepartment; immediately refer any derogatory name to the State Committee on\n\nGeographic Names; and remove any derogatory name prepared by or for such\ndivision or department prior to the map being issued, or reissued, by such\ndivision or department in any form. Further, I direct each division within the Executive\n\nDepartment and all other departments of the State to assist the State Committee\non Geographic Names in its function to insure the prompt adoption of\nreplacement names in consultation with the interested local community.
