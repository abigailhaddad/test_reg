(b) For\npurposes of the annual HEAP State Plan, a household is defined as any\nindividual or group of individuals who are living together as one economic unit\nfor whom residential energy is customarily purchased in common or who make\nundesignated payments for energy in the form of rent and such individual or\ngroup of individuals occupy a housing unit. Any individual residing in a\nhousing unit who is related by blood, marriage or adoption to any other\nhousehold member shall be presumed a household member in determining HEAP\neligibility unless he/she supplies reasonable evidence to rebut this\npresumption. Relationship by blood, marriage or adoption is deemed to include\nthe following: (1)\nfather, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister; or\n(2)\nstepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, and stepsister. In determining household size, adults in foster care, foster care children and nonrelated roomers and/or boarders must be excluded\nfrom the household count. (c) Regular HEAP benefit. For purposes of the\nannual HEAP State Plan, eligibility for the regular HEAP benefit must be\ndetermined annually and must be based on the household's circumstances (income, household size, energy type, etc.) for the entire calendar month in which the\nhousehold has filed its application. In order to be eligible for a regular HEAP\nbenefit, a household must pay for heat directly or make undesignated energy\npayments for heat in the form of rent and not reside in an ineligible living\nsituation as provided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. If heat is not\nincluded in the applicant's rent, a vendor relationship must be established for\nthe applicant household. The vendor relationship must be documented by a\ncurrent fuel/utility bill or contact with the fuel/utility company. While the\napplicant is not required to be the customer of record for regular HEAP, direct\nresponsibility for payment of the bill must be established if the applicant or\nmember of the applicant household is not the customer of record. The term\ncustomer of record means a person or persons who have an account, in their\nname, with a home energy vendor. The term home energy vendor means an\nindividual or entity engaged in the business of selling electricity, natural\ngas, oil, propane, kerosene, coal, wood, or any other fuel used for residential\nheating.

To be considered heat-related, a residential energy bill must be for\nthe household's primary heating fuel or for electricity essential to operate\nthe household's primary heating equipment. A HEAP emergency benefit may be\ngranted to an individual who is not a tenant and/or customer of record where\nsuch individual is a spouse of a tenant and/or customer of record who is living\nin the household of such tenant and/or customer of record or who is the\nsurviving spouse of a deceased spouse who was the tenant and/or customer of\nrecord. In addition, emergency benefits may be provided under this subdivision\nwhen a household: (i) is financially eligible\nfor the regular HEAP benefit except that a tenant of record and/or customer of\nrecord who is ineligible for regular HEAP benefits because he or she is not a\n\nUnited States citizen, a national or a qualified alien may receive emergency\nHEAP benefits on behalf of members of the household who are United States\ncitizens, nationals or qualified aliens; and\n(ii)\nis currently without heating fuel; or\n(iii)\nhas a heating fuel supply\nthat will last less than seven calendar days; or\n(iv)\nhas had heat-related utility service\ndisconnected; or\n(v) has\nheat-related utility service scheduled for disconnection; (vi)\nhas essential applicant-owned heating\nequipment that is inoperable or unsafe and is in need of\nrepair/maintenance/replacement; or\n(vii)\nis in an emergency home heating\nsituation which is deemed by the social services district to be detrimental to\nthe health or safety of household members if temporary emergency shelter or\nrelocation is not provided; and\n(viii)\ncannot make alternative payment\narrangements and/or other housing accommodations appropriate for the\nhousehold's best interests are not available; and\n(ix)\nhas no liquid resources to ameliorate\nthe emergency except that households otherwise eligible for replacement of\nessential heating equipment may have available liquid resources not exceeding\n$3,000 per household.

These instances must be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. The amount authorized must be that amount necessary to\nalleviate the emergency but in no event can such emergency benefits exceed a\ntotal of $500 per program year to provide temporary emergency shelter or\nrelocation for a household.
