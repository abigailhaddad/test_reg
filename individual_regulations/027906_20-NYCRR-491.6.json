  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 491.6 - Trip permits\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 301-h(c), 522(d) and 528(b)\n(a) Any carrier who occasionally operates a\nqualified motor vehicle on the public highways of New York State that is\nsubject to the provisions of the fuel use tax, may apply to the department or a\npermit service for a trip permit to satisfy the New York State fuel use tax and\nIFTA requirements. A trip permit is valid for a period of 72 hours from the\ntime of its issuance. A trip permit issued in accordance with the provisions of\narticle 21-A of the Tax Law and this section is separate and distinct from the\nhighway use tax trip permit issued in accordance with the provisions of article\n21 of such law and Article 1 of this Subchapter. (b) (1)\n\nAn\napplication for a trip permit must be made on the form prescribed by the\ndepartment for such purpose and must contain all of the information required\ntherein. Such application must be accompanied by a permit fee of $25.00 made\npayable by certified check or other guaranteed draft acceptable to the\ndepartment, in United States funds, made out to the Commissioner of Taxation\nand Finance. When applying to the department, a complete application for a trip\npermit, together with the proper fee, must be received by the department at\nleast 30 days prior to the 72-hour period for which such permit is to be in\neffect. If an application or fee is not received by the department at least 30\ndays prior to such 72-hour period, the application may be denied and returned, with the fee, to the carrier. (2)\nA\ncarrier requiring the expeditious issuance of a trip permit\n(\ni.e., less than 30 days prior to the period for which the\npermit is required), may apply for such a permit through a permit service\nauthorized by the department to issue trip permits in its behalf. (See section\n491.5\nof this\n\nPart for information pertaining to permit services.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n491.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
