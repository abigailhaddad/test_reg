  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.10 - Generic environmental impact statements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Generic EISs may be broader, and more\ngeneral than site or project specific EISs and should discuss the logic and\nrationale for the choices advanced. They may also include an assessment of\nspecific impacts if such details are available. They may be based on conceptual\ninformation in some cases. They may identify the important elements of the\nnatural resource base as well as the existing and projected cultural features, patterns and character. They may discuss in general terms the constraints and\nconsequences of any narrowing of future options. They may present and analyze\nin general terms a few hypothetical scenarios that could and are likely to\noccur. A generic EIS may be used to assess the environmental impacts of: (1)\na number of separate actions in a given\ngeographic area which, if considered singly, may have minor impacts, but if\nconsidered together may have significant impacts; (2)\na sequence of actions, contemplated by a\nsingle agency or individual; (3)\nseparate actions having generic or common impacts; or\n(4)\nan entire program or plan having wide\napplication or restricting the range of future alternative policies or\nprojects, including new or significant changes to existing land use plans, development plans, zoning regulations or agency comprehensive resource\nmanagement plans. (b) In\nparticular, agencies may prepare generic EISs on the adoption of a\ncomprehensive plan prepared in accordance with subdivision 4, section\n28-a\nof the General City Law; subdivision\n4, section\n272-a\nof the Town Law; or subdivision 4, section\n7-722\nof the Village Law and the\nimplementing regulations. Impacts of individual actions proposed to be carried\nout in conformance with these adopted plans and regulations and the thresholds\nor conditions identified in the generic EIS may require no or limited SEQR\nreview as described in subdivisions (c) and (d) of this section. (c) Generic EISs and their findings should\nset forth specific conditions or criteria under which future actions may be\nundertaken or approved, including requirements for any subsequent SEQR\ncompliance. This may include thresholds and criteria for supplemental EISs to\nreflect specific significant impacts, such as site-specific impacts, that were\nnot adequately addressed or analyzed in the generic EIS. (d) When a final generic EIS has been filed\nunder this part: (1)\n\nNo further SEQR\ncompliance is required in the following circumstances: (i) if a subsequent proposed action will be\ncarried out in conformance with the conditions and thresholds established for\nsuch actions in the generic EIS or its findings statement; or\n(ii)\nthe lead agency determines not to\napprove, undertake or fund the action; (2)\n\nAn amended findings statement must be\nprepared if the subsequent proposed action was adequately addressed in the\ngeneric EIS but was not addressed or was not adequately addressed in the\nfindings statement for the generic EIS; (3)\nA negative declaration must be prepared\nif a subsequent proposed action was not addressed or was not adequately\naddressed in the generic EIS and the subsequent action will not result in any\nsignificant environmental impacts; and\n(4)\nA supplement to the final generic EIS\nmust be prepared if the subsequent proposed action was not addressed or was not\nadequately addressed in the generic EIS and the subsequent action may have one\nor more significant adverse environmental impacts. (e) In connection with projects that are to\nbe developed in phases or stages, agencies should address not only the\nsite-specific impacts of the individual project under consideration, but also, in more general or conceptual terms, the cumulative impacts on the environment\nand the existing natural resource base of subsequent phases of a larger project\nor series of projects that may be developed in the future. In these cases, this\npart of the generic EIS must discuss the important elements and constraints\npresent in the natural and cultural environment that may bear on the conditions\nof an agency decision on the immediate project.
