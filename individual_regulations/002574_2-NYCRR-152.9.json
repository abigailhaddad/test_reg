  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 152.9 - Sponsor contributions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Within\n45 days of receiving from the administrator a copy of the certified list in\naccordance with section\n152.7\nof this Part, the program\nactuary shall calculate and the administrator shall bill the sponsor for the\ncontribution due for the calendar year ended on the immediately preceding\n\nDecember 31st. In addition to the program administration costs for such year, such contribution shall include the actuarially determined normal cost plus any\nprior service costs associated with the adoption of a program, including the\nconversion from a defined contribution plan service award program to a defined\nbenefit plan program, or the adoption of an amendment to an existing program. For good cause shown, the program actuary may recalculate the contribution, and, in such a case, the administrator shall issue a corrected bill. (b) Within 60 days of the invoice date of a\nbill for sponsor contributions, the sponsor shall pay to the administrator the\ntotal amount of the sponsor contribution shown on such invoice. (c) The actuarial methodology and assumptions\nused by the program actuary to calculate such annual contribution shall be the\nsame for all defined benefit plan service award programs. (d) The actuarial methodology and assumptions\nused by the program actuary to calculate such annual contribution shall be\nreviewed beginning with the calendar year 2000 sponsor contribution and for\nevery third program (calendar) year thereafter by an independent enrolled\nactuary selected and retained by the program actuary subject to approval by the\n\nComptroller. Such enrolled actuary shall submit a written report to the program\nactuary and the Comptroller regarding the appropriateness of the actuarial\nmethodology and assumptions used by the program actuary in the calculation of\nthe program costs and the funded status of the existing defined benefit plan\nprogram as a whole. In addition, the enrolled actuary, on a statistical random\nsampling basis of sufficient size, shall select a number of specific programs\nto audit for completeness and correctness of participant data, consistency of\nactuarial cost calculations with program provisions and correctness of\nactuarial calculations. (e) Interest shall accrue and be paid by the sponsor on all contributions due\nduring a calendar year but not received by the administrator within 60 days of\nthe invoice date or the billing statement from the administrator to the sponsor\nfor the amount of annual contribution owed. The interest rate or rates used to\ncalculate such interest shall be the greater of: (1)\nthe investment return rate (or rates)\nassumed by the program actuary in the calculation of the normal cost component\nof such unpaid contribution; or\n(2)\nthe actual investment return rate earned by the volunteer ambulance workers'\ndefined benefit plan service award program trust fund during the calendar year\n(or years) in which such unpaid contributions were due to be paid. (f) The administrator shall notify\nthe Comptroller of any outstanding unpaid contributions after the end of a\ncalendar year during which payment of contributions should have been received\nby the administrator. (g) In the\nevent that a sponsor does not submit to the administrator the certified list\n(with supporting documentation) in accordance with section\n152.7\nof this Part, the\nadministrator shall bill the sponsor for the contribution due during the\ncalendar year in which the list should have been submitted in an amount\ncalculated by the program actuary equal to the estimated contribution due\nduring such year. Such estimated contribution shall be calculated by the\nprogram actuary as if all volunteer ambulance workers on the latest year's\ncertified list received by the administrator continued to be volunteer\nambulance workers and all such persons earned year of service credit during the\ncalendar year or years for which the list or lists should have been prepared in\naccordance with section\n152.7\nof this Part. Payment of such\ncontribution shall be made in accordance with subdivisions (b) and (e) of this\nsection as if the program actuary's cost calculations were based upon the\nactual certified listings prepared in accordance with section\n152.7\nof this Part. Upon receipt by\nthe administrator of the actual certified list prepared in accordance with\nsection\n152.7\nof this Part, the program\nactuary shall calculate the actual amount of contributions due for such\ncalendar year. In the event that additional contributions are owed by the\nsponsor (including any additional administration costs), the administrator\nshall bill the sponsor for such additional amounts. Interest shall be paid by\nthe sponsor on all additional amounts owed and shall accrue from the due date\nof the payment of the estimated contribution billed to the sponsor by the\nadministrator with such interest calculated in accordance with subdivision (e)\nof this section. Any excess of the estimated contributions over the actual\ncontributions shall be refunded to the sponsor. The amount of such refund shall\nbe reduced by any related additional administration costs charged by the\nadministrator or the program actuary. The assessment of any extra additional\nadministration charges payable by the sponsor to either the administrator or\nthe program actuary because of the failure to comply with section\n152.7\nof this Part shall be in\naccordance with the contract(s) between the Comptroller and the\nadministrator/program actuary. (h) In the event that two years have elapsed since an inactive volunteer ambulance\nworker participant or a participant's designated beneficiary becomes eligible\nto apply for a service award and the administrator does not receive an\napplication for distribution, the administrator, the sponsor and the ambulance\ncompany in which the participant was a member shall attempt to notify the\nperson or persons to whom the service award would be paid. In the event that\nthe administrator, in his sole discretion, determines that a reasonable attempt\nhas been made to contact such person or persons without success, the service\naward payable shall then be considered as forfeited for the purpose of\ndetermining future contributions payable by the sponsor. Such forfeiture shall\nbe treated by the program actuary as an actuarial gain in the program cost\ncalculations in the same manner as any other forfeiture of a service award. The\nfunds accumulated to pay the participant or the participant's beneficiary shall\nremain within the service award program trust fund as if such funds were the\naccumulated funds associated with the forfeiture of a non-vested service award. Should the person to whom service award payments are owed subsequently file an\napplication for payment with the administrator, the administrator shall\ndetermine and pay the amount of the service award owed to the person and the\nactuarial liability for such payments shall be included in subsequent actuarial\ncalculations of the sponsor's funding costs of the program by the program\nactuary.
