  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 1204.7 - Construction permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) On or after\n\nJuly 1, 1990, no State agency shall commence the erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, improvement, relocation, removal, or demolition of any\nbuilding or structure without first obtaining a construction permit from a\nconstruction-permitting agency. Work which is not subject to the Uniform Code\nshall not require a permit. No permit shall be required for the performance of\nnecessary repairs which do not materially affect structural elements and/or the\nplumbing, electrical, or heating/ventilation systems, nor for the construction\nof storage facilities of less than 3000 cubic feet. No permit shall be required\nfor work costing $20,000 or less on an existing building provided that such\nexemption does not conflict with the procedures of any construction-permitting\nagency involved in the project. All work shall nevertheless be done in\nconformance with the Uniform Code. (b) Prior to the issuance of a construction\npermit, the issuing agency shall obtain and retain on file the following\ninformation: (1)\na description of the site\nupon which the proposed work is to be done; (2)\na description of the use or occupancy of\nall parts of the land and of the proposed building or structure; (3)\nwhere work is proposed for an existing\nstructure, a description of the current use or occupancy of the\nstructure; (4)\na description of the\nwork proposed to be undertaken; (5)\nthe name(s) of the State agency which will have custody of the structure during\nconstruction and after the project is completed; and\n(6)\na complete set of plans and\nspecifications for the proposed project. The issuing agency may waive the requirement for plans and\nspecifications where the work to be done involves minor alterations or where\nplans and specifications are otherwise unnecessary. (c) Each State agency seeking a\nconstruction permit shall be responsible for providing to the\nconstruction-permitting agency the information specified in subdivision (b) of\nthis section. During the period that the permit is in effect the applicant\nagency shall notify the issuing agency whenever any changes occur in the\ninformation contained within a permit application. A permit shall not be issued\nunless the proposed work is determined to be in conformance with the\nrequirements of the Uniform Code. The authority conferred by a permit may be\nlimited by conditions contained therein. (d) A construction permit issued pursuant to\nthis Part may be suspended or revoked by the issuing agency if it is determined\nthat the work to which it pertains is not proceeding in conformance with the\n\nUniform Code or with any condition attached to such permit or if there has been\na misrepresentation or a falsification of a material fact in connection with\nthe application for the permit. (e) A construction permit issued pursuant to this Part shall be valid for a period\nof time specified by the issuing agency, such period not to exceed three years. A construction permit shall expire upon the issuance of a code compliance\ncertificate. A construction permit may be renewed for successive periods of up\nto three years each provided that: (1)\nthe\npermit has not been revoked or suspended at the time the application for\nrenewal is made; and\n(2)\nthe\nrelevant information included in the permit application is up to\ndate. (f) No State\nagency shall disburse funds for work requiring a construction permit until such\npermit has been obtained. (g) In\nthe event of the occurrence of a construction emergency, a State agency may\nundertake emergency repairs or reconstruction work without first obtaining a\nconstruction permit as required by subdivision (a) of this section. All work, however, should be done in conformance with applicable provisions of the\n\nUniform Code. The occurrence of a construction emergency will not exempt a\n\nState agency from the requirement of section\n1204.9\nof this Part to obtain a\ncode compliance certificate for all work subject to provisions of the Uniform\n\nCode. As soon as emergency circumstances allow and before the issuance of a\ncode compliance certificate for any work performed, the agency which undertook\nthe work shall submit to the appropriate construction-permitting agency\ndocumentation sufficient to establish that all work was performed in compliance\nwith applicable provisions of the Uniform Code.
