  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 822.8 - Patient Records/Treatment Planning\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General requirements for all patient\nrecords. All programs must maintain a patient record (either electronic or\npaper) for each patient who receives services. The patient record must\ndemonstrate a chronological pattern of delivered medical and treatment services\nconsistent with the patient's prior treatment history, if any, and the\npatient's evolving treatment/recovery plan, updated regularly through progress\nnotes. The patient record shall also include: (1)\nthe source of referral, if applicable; (2)\na notation that, prior to the first\ntreatment visit, the patient received a copy of the program's rules and\nregulations, including patient's rights (Part 815) and a summary of the federal\nconfidentiality requirements, that such rules and regulations were discussed\nwith the patient, including their ability to designate individuals to be\nnotified in case of an emergency and that the patient indicated he/she\nunderstood them; (3)\nany clinical\nor non-clinical documentation or determination applicable to the delivery of\nmedical and treatment services for a patient and/or supporting the patient's\nevolving treatment/recovery plan; (4)\nthe individual treatment/recovery plan and all reviews and\nupdates thereto through progress notes; (5)\nsigned releases of consent for information; (6)\ndocumentation of services in accordance\nwith this Part; (7)\ndocumentation\nof level of care determinations using the OASAS level of care protocol for\nadmission and level of care transition; (8)\ntransition planning, including medication list, circumstances/reason, and referrals made; (9)\nif the patient is a minor being treated without parental\nconsent, documentation establishing that the provisions of Mental Hygiene Law\nsection 22.11 have been met. (10)\ninformation and documentation required in screening and admission; (11)\nall lab results; (12)\ncurrent approved medication doses and\njustification for any changes; and\n(13)\ninclude an order sheet that is displayed in the patient\nrecord and signed (physical or electronic signature) by any medical\nprofessional licensed under the appropriate state law authorizing such change\nand noting the date for each approved medication order and dose\nchange. (b) Admission\nrequirements applicable to all programs: (1)\n\nDiagnosis. (i) Unless otherwise authorized, the program must document that the individual is determined to have a substance\nuse disorder based on the criteria in the most recent version of the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases\n(ICD). (ii)\n\nFor a significant\nother, the program must document that the individual is determined to have a\ndiagnosis consistent with the presenting concerns related to a close\nrelationship with someone who has a substance use disorder. (2)\n\nIf an individual has been referred by an\n\nOffice approved Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) provider/practitioner, any\nassessment created by such provider which meets the requirements of this\nsection may be used to admit the patient. (3)\n\nDocumentation of admission must: (i) include the level of care determination; (ii)\ninclude an assessment, initial services\nand diagnosis that form the basis of the treatment/recovery plan; (iii)\nbe made by a clinical staff member who\nis a qualified health professional and must be documented by the dated\nsignature (physical or electronic) of the qualified health professional working\nwithin their scope of practice and include the basis for admitting the patient; and\n(iv)\nbe approved by the dated\nsignature (physical electronic) of a physician, physician's assistant, nurse\npractitioner, licensed psychologist, or licensed clinical social\nworker. (4)\n\nPatients\nbeing admitted to an OTP must be documented to have a minimum 12-month opioid\nuse disorder (OUD) accompanied by a physical evaluation. A comprehensive\nphysical examination must be completed within fourteen days, or otherwise in\naccordance with federal rules. (5)\n\nIf the presenting individual is determined to be inappropriate for admission to\nthe program, a referral and connection to a more appropriate service must be\nmade, unless the individual is already receiving substance use disorder\nservices from another provider. Individuals deemed ineligible for admission\nmust be informed of the reason. (6)\n\nNo individual that meets level of care criteria may be denied admission to a\nprogram consistent with the provisions of Part 815 of this Title. (7)\n\nAll prospective patients must be\ninformed that admission to a program is on a voluntary basis and a prospective\npatient is free to discharge themselves from the service at any time. For\nprospective patients under an external mandate, the potential consequences for\npremature discharge must be explained, including that the external mandate does\nnot alter the voluntary nature of admission, continued treatment, and\ntoxicology screening. (8)\nA\nsignificant other may be admitted to a program regardless of whether the\nindividual with whom they are associated is in treatment. A significant other\nis not appropriate for admission to an outpatient rehabilitation\nservice. (c) Post-admission. (1)\n\nAs soon as possible after\nadmission, if not already complete, every patient must be: (i) offered viral hepatitis testing; testing\nmay be done on site or by referral; (ii)\noffered HIV testing; testing must be conducted with patient\nconsent in accordance with public health law and may be done on site or by\nreferral; individuals on a regimen of pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, must\nbe permitted to continue the regimen until consultation with the prescribing\nprofessional occurs; (iii)\nscreened for co-occurring mental health conditions and behavioral health risk\nincluding suicide risk using validated screening instruments approved by the\n\nOffice. (2)\n\nIf\nclinically indicated, all programs must: (i) conduct an intradermal skin or blood-based Tuberculosis test; testing may be\ndone on site or by referral with results as soon as possible after testing; for\npatients with a positive test result, refer the patient for further\ntuberculosis evaluation. (ii)\noffer testing for other sexually transmitted infections; testing may be done on\nsite or by referral; (iii)\nprovide\nor recommend any other tests the examining physician or other medical staff\nmember deems to be necessary including, but not limited to, an EKG, a chest\nX-ray, or a pregnancy test. (3)\n\nAs soon as possible after testing programs must explain or\nensure that the provider has explained, any blood and skin test results to the\npatient. (4)\n\nFor those patients\nwho have not had a physical examination within one year prior to admission, each such patient must either be assessed by a member of the medical staff to\nascertain the need for a physical examination or referred for a physical\nexamination. For those patients who have had a physical examination within one\nyear prior to admission, or for those patients being admitted directly to the\noutpatient program from another substance use disorder service authorized by\nthe Office, the existing medical history and physical examination documentation\nmay be used to comply with the requirements of this subdivision, provided such\ndocumentation has been reviewed by a medical staff member and determined to be\ncurrent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HIV and viral hepatitis testing shall\nbe offered regardless of a documented history within the previous twelve\nmonths. OTPs are exempt from this requirement but must provide physical\nexaminations in accordance with federal rules. (d) Additional admission requirements for\noutpatient rehabilitation services. In addition to the requirements of\nparagraph (a) of this section, an individual must also meet the criteria in\n\nSection\n822.10\nof this Part to be admitted\nto an outpatient rehabilitation service. (e) Additional admission requirements for OTPs. (1)\n\nThe decision to admit a prospective\npatient for treatment is finalized on the date of administration or\nprescription of the initial approved medication dose after satisfaction of all\napplicable requirements of this Part. Prospective patients with a chronic\nimmune deficiency or prospective patients who are pregnant and have a current\nopioid or past opioid dependency must be screened and admitted on a priority\nbasis. No person under the age of 16 may be admitted without the prior approval\nof the Office. The following requirements must be met for an individual to be\nadmitted: (2)\n\nIn order to\nadminister the first medication dose, a patient must have an in-person\nevaluation, including a physical evaluation, to determine that they have had a\nphysiological dependence on opioids for at least the previous 12-month period, and must diagnose and document such, provided however: (i) a prospective patient may be admitted who voluntarily\ncompleted treatment in another program without confirming current opioid\ndependence if the program confirms that the: (a) voluntary completion of treatment occurred within the previous\n24 months; and\n(b) treatment lasted at least 6 months; (ii)\na prospective patient who is less than 18 years of age may be\nadmitted if such patient has had at least two prior treatment episodes within a\n12-month period and a dependence on opioids; (iii)\na prospective patient who resided in a correctional or\nchronic care facility for at least one month, if assessed within 6 months after\nrelease or discharge, may be admitted if the prospective patient would have\nbeen eligible for admission prior to residing in such\nfacility. (3)\nA\nphysician, or other practitioner with federal approval, must ensure that prior\nto first dose, the prospective patient is provided and signs (physical or\nelectronic signature) an informed written consent to participate in an opioid\ntreatment program, which shall include notice of the risks and benefits of a\nprescribed medicine. (4)\n\nEach OTP\nmust issue a photo-identification card to each patient within two weeks after\nadmission; patients may carry the identification or, at the patient's option, have the identification maintained at the program. (f) Readmissions to OTPs. Programs need not\nrepeat admission procedures for any patient who is being re-admitted within\nthree (3) months of discharge and need not repeat a medical and laboratory\nexamination if the patient received a medical and laboratory exam within the\nprevious year, provided: (1)\n\nThe patient's\nprior medical records must be combined with the new medical records within\nthirty days of the patient's readmission; (2)\neach program must immediately readmit patients who were\npreviously discharged from that program: (i) after a stay of 30 days or more in a hospital, nursing home, or other health\ncare facility, if such patient is still being maintained on an approved\nmedication, and/or meets the eligibility requirements when released; or\n(ii)\nafter an extended\nincarceration (including KEEP), if clinically appropriate when such patient is\nreleased. (g) Transfers between OTPs. (1)\n\nEach program must\ndevelop procedures regarding the transfer of patients which must ensure that\nthe program shall: (i) not deny a reasonable\nrequest for a temporary or permanent transfer; (ii)\nnot include \"temporary-to-permanent\" conditions, whereby a\npatient is temporarily provided guest medication and then evaluated as to\nwhether or not the OTP will permanently admit, unless otherwise authorized by\nthe Office; (iii)\nregard transferred\npatients as continuing in treatment by incorporating their length of treatment\nand treatment/recovery plans from the referring program; (iv)\nsend or receive the reason for the\ntransfer and provide the most current medical, counseling, and laboratory\ninformation within fourteen (14) days of the request. Receipt of this\ninformation is not required prior to acceptance and the failure to receive this\ninformation will not preclude acceptance; and\n(v) continue the patient's approved medication dosage and\ntake-home schedule unless new medical or clinical information requires medical\nstaff to review and subsequently order a change. (2)\n\nEach program must develop procedures for\nthe temporary transfer of patients which must ensure that the: (i) transferring programs forward\ninformation on fees, contact person, time and dose of medication to the\nreceiving program; (ii)\n\nProgram\nsends or receives prior to the patient's arrival the reason for the temporary\ntransfer including temporary dates and approved medication dose; (iii)\n\nProgram shall not deny a reasonable\nrequest for a temporary transfer; (iv)\ntransferring program remains responsible for the patient's\noverall treatment. The receiving program may deliver any necessary service\nafter consultation with the transferring program; and\n(v) receiving program prescribing\nprofessional must write an order to continue the patient's medication dose and\ntake-home schedule. (h) Treatment/recovery plan. (1)\n\nEach patient must have a written person-centered treatment/recovery plan\ndeveloped by the clinical staff person with primary responsibility for the\npatient, in collaboration with the patient and anyone identified by the patient\nas supportive to recovery goals. The treatment/recovery plan begins with the\nassessment incorporated into the patient record and is regularly updated with\nprogress notes. (i) Minor patients: If the\npatient is a minor, the treatment/recovery plan must also be developed in\nconsultation with the patient's parent or guardian unless the minor is being\ntreated without parental consent as authorized by Mental Hygiene Law section\n22.11. (ii)\n\nImmediate transfer: For\npatients moving directly from one program to another, the existing\ntreatment/recovery plan may be used if there is documentation that it has been\nreviewed and, if necessary, updated to reflect patient goals as\nappropriate. (2)\n\nThe\ntreatment/recovery plan must: (i) include the\nassessment, which identifies each diagnosis for which the patient is being\ntreated; (ii)\nbe incorporated into\nthe patient record through regular progress notes, including initial services\nto be offered prior to completion of the initial assessment; (iii)\naddress patient goals as identified\nthrough the assessment process and regularly updated as needed through progress\nnotes; (iv)\nidentify a single\nmember of the clinical staff responsible for coordinating and managing the\npatient's treatment who shall approve and sign (physical or electronic\nsignature) such plan; (v) reference\nto any significant medical and psychiatric issues, including all medications, by acknowledging review of medical/psychiatric assessment and progress notes, as well as coordination with mental and psychiatric providers; and\n(vi)\nbe reviewed and approved by the\nclinical staff person responsible for developing the plan, the patient and the\nclinical supervisor. (i) Continuing review of treatment/recovery plans. The\ntreatment/recovery plan must be reviewed through the ongoing assessment process\nand regular progress notes. (j) Progress Notes. Progress notes are intended to document the patient's clinical\nstatus. Service delivery should be documented in the patient record through\nregular progress notes that include, unless otherwise indicated, the type, content, duration and outcome of each service delivered to or on behalf of a\npatient, described and verified as follows: (1)\nbe written and signed (physical or electronic signature) by\nthe staff member providing the service; (2)\nindicate the date the service was delivered; (3)\nrecord the relationship to the patient's\ndeveloping treatment goals described in the treatment/recovery plan; and\n(4)\ninclude, as appropriate and\nrelevant, any recommendations, communications, or determinations for initial, continued or revised patient goals and/or treatment. (k) The program's multidisciplinary team, as\ndefined in Part 800 of this Title, shall meet on a regularly scheduled basis\nfor the purpose of reviewing a sample of cases for the purpose of clinical\nmonitoring of practice. This meeting shall be documented as to date, attendance, cases reviewed and recommendations. (l) Pregnancies. Treatment/recovery plans must include provisions\nfor pre-natal care for all patients who are pregnant or become pregnant. If a\npregnant patient refuses or fails to obtain such care, the provider must have\nthe patient acknowledge in writing that pre-natal care was offered, recommended, and refused. The program should also offer to develop a plan of\nsafe care with the patient and anyone identified by the patient, such offer\nshould be noted in the patient record. (m) Communicable disease. Treatment/recovery plans must include\nprovisions for the prevention, care and treatment of HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and/or sexually transmitted infections when present. If a patient\nrefuses to obtain such care, the provider must have the patient acknowledge in\nwriting that such care was offered, recommended, and refused. (n) Transfers. If patients are transferred\nbetween a SUD outpatient program and outpatient rehabilitation services within\nthe same provider, a single patient record may be maintained provided that it\nincludes clinical justification for the transfer, the effective date of the\ntransfer and a revised treatment/recovery plan, if necessary, signed (physical\nor electronic signature) by a clinical staff member and their\nsupervisor. (o) Confidentiality. Patient records maintained by the program are confidential and may only be\ndisclosed consistent with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\n\nAct (HIPAA) and the federal regulations governing the confidentiality of\npatients' records as set forth in 42 CFR Part\n2\nand other applicable\nlaw. (p) Records retention. Patient\nrecords must be retained for ten (10) years after the date of discharge or last\ncontact, or three (3) years after the patient reaches the age of eighteen, whichever time period is longer. (q) Patient deaths. If a patient dies while in active treatment\nany known details must be documented in the patient record. (r) Transition or discharge criteria. (1)\n\nPatients having no contact or intent to\ncontinue accessing services from a program should be discharged after a period\nnot exceeding sixty (60) days unless reason for continuing treatment past that\nperiod is identified and documented in the patient record. (2)\n\nIndividuals entering treatment should\nprogress by meeting treatment milestones including: stabilization; engagement; goal setting; and attainment of patient-centered goals. Individuals should be\nconsidered for transitions to the community or another level of care once they\nhave stabilized and attained the support necessary to support their goals. If\nan individual leaving treatment expresses a preference for a level of care or\nservices that preference should be included in the patient record. (3)\n\nIndividuals who are discharged\ninvoluntarily must be discharged consistent with Part 815 of this\n\nTitle. (4)\n\nTransition plan. (i) A transition plan must be developed in\ncollaboration with the patient and any collateral person(s) the patient chooses\nto involve. Such plan shall specify needed referrals with appointment dates and\ntimes, all known medications (including frequency and dosage) and\nrecommendations for continued care. (ii)\n\nThe transition plan shall include an appointment with an\nappropriate provider to continue access to approved medications to treat the\npatient's substance use disorder. (iii)\n\nIf the patient is a minor, the plan must also be developed\nin consultation with their parent or guardian, unless the minor is being\ntreated without parental consent as authorized by Mental Hygiene Law section\n22.11; information pertaining to the testing and treatment of sexually\ntransmitted infections cannot be shared with the minor patient's parent or\nguardian without the patient's consent, in accordance with applicable laws and\nregulations. (5)\n\nNo\npatient may be discharged without a plan which has been previously reviewed and\napproved by a clinical staff member and the clinical supervisor. This\nrequirement does not apply to patients who stop attending, or otherwise fail to\ncooperate, or refuse continuing care or OBOT planning. That portion of the\ntransition plan which includes referrals for continuing care must be given to\nthe patient prior to leaving the program. The patient, and their\nfamily/significant other(s), shall be offered overdose prevention education and\ntraining, and a naloxone kit or prescription. (s) Continuing Care. Individuals may be\nadmitted to continuing care when they require a less intensive amount of\nsupport and services and there is a documented clinical need for ongoing\nclinical support to maintain gains made in treatment. (1)\n\nThe purpose of continuing care is to provide ongoing disease\nmanagement services including management of life stressors, urges and cravings, mood and interpersonal relationships and to maintain gains made in\ntreatment. (2)\n\nIndividuals in\ncontinuing care may receive counseling or peer services, rehabilitative support\nservices including case management and medication management services as\nneeded.
