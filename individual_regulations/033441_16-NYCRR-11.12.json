  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 11.12 - Residential service deposits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For\nthe purposes of this section, a new residential customer is an applicant. A\nseasonal customer is a person who applies for and receives utility service\nperiodically each year, intermittently during the year, or at other irregular\nintervals. A short-term customer is a person who requires service for a\nspecified period of time that does not exceed one year. A customer who receives\ncontinuous utility service for more than one year shall not be considered a\nseasonal or short-term customer. (b) Unless authorized by the commission under\nsubdivision (e) of this section, no utility shall require any new residential\ncustomer to post a security deposit as a condition of receiving utility\nservice, unless such new customer is a seasonal or short-term\ncustomer. (c) (1)\n\nAs of September 1, 1982, no distribution\nutility shall, unless authorized by the commission under subdivision (e) of\nthis section, require a current residential customer, other than a delinquent\ncustomer, to post a security deposit, and deposits held on that day shall be\nreturned promptly to nondelinquent residential customers, and in no event later\nthan the next bill for service. (2)\n\nAs of June 18, 2003, no utility shall, unless authorized by the commission\nunder subdivision (e) of this section, require a current residential customer, other than a delinquent customer, to post a security deposit. Deposits held\nfrom current, nondelinquent customers whose agreement for the provision of\ncommodity was renewed on or continued on or after June 18, 2003 shall be\nreturned promptly to such customers, and in no event later than the next bill\nfor service. (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (c) of this section: (1)\na utility may continue to demand deposits\nas a condition of receiving utility service from customers who are seasonal\ncustomers or short-term customers as defined in subdivision (a) of this\nsection; and\n(2)\na utility may\nrequire a deposit from a residential customer as a condition of service if that\ncustomer is delinquent in payment of his or her utility bills. A current\ncustomer is delinquent for the purpose of a deposit assessment if such\ncustomer: (i) accumulates two consecutive\nmonths of arrears without making reasonable payment, defined as one half of the\ntotal arrears, of such charges before the time that a late payment charge, as\ndescribed in section\n11.15\nof this Part, would become\napplicable, or fails to make a reasonable payment on a bimonthly bill within 50\ndays after the bill is due, provided that the utility requests such deposit\nwithin two months of such failure to pay; or\n(ii)\nhad utility service terminated, disconnected or suspended for nonpayment during the preceding six months. A utility intending to require a deposit under subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph shall provide a customer written notice, at least 20 days\nbefore it may assess a deposit, that the failure to make timely payment will\npermit the utility to require a deposit from such customer. (3)\n\nIf a utility requires a\ndeposit from a current residential customer who is delinquent by virtue of his\nor her failure to make a reasonable payment of arrears, as provided in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, it shall permit such customer to pay the\ndeposit in installments over a period not to exceed 12 months. (4)\nA utility may require deposits as a\ncondition of receiving utility service from new residential customers who fail\nto provide reasonable proof of identity pursuant to section\n11.3\nof this Part, provided a\nhearing has been held pursuant to Public Service Law, section 36(2) and\nrequired findings have been made by the commission. (e) Notwithstanding the requirements of\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, a utility may demand and hold\ndeposits from new or current residential customers as a condition of utility\nservice if the commission after investigation and hearing so authorizes such\npractice, upon a finding that the collection and maintenance of such deposits\nis cost-effective for the utility as a whole without regard to the utility's\ncash flow and the availability of capital to the utility. (f) No utility shall require any person it\nknows to be a recipient of public assistance, supplemental security income, or\nadditional State payments, to post a security deposit. (g) No utility shall demand or hold a deposit\nfrom any new or current residential customer it knows is 62 years of age or\nolder unless such customer has had service terminated, disconnected or\nsuspended by the utility for nonpayment of bills within the preceding six\nmonths. (h) In any case where\ncustomer deposits are authorized by this section, a utility may require a new\nor current residential customer to deposit a reasonable amount of money not\ngreater than twice the average monthly bill for a calendar year, except in the\ncase of electric or gas space heating customers, where deposits may not exceed\ntwice the estimated average monthly bill for the heating season, in order to\nsecure payment for services actually rendered or for the rental of fixtures, instruments and facilities actually supplied. Every utility shall allow every\ncustomer from whom a deposit is required, interest on the amount deposited at a\nrate prescribed annually by the commission in light of the current economic\nconditions and current charges paid for moneys borrowed by such utility, taking\ninto account the expenses incurred by such utility in obtaining, handling, returning or crediting the sum deposited. Such interest shall be paid to the\ncustomer upon the return of the deposit, or where the deposit has been held for\na period of one year, the interest shall be credited to the customer on the\nfirst billing for utility service rendered after the end of such period. If any\ncustomer is not delinquent in the payment of bills, as defined in paragraph\n(d)(2) of this section, during the one-year period from the payment of the\ndeposit, the deposit shall be refunded promptly without prejudice to the\nutility's right to require a future deposit in the event that the customer\nthereafter becomes delinquent.
