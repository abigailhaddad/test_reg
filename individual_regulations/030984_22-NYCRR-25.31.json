  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 25.31 - Establishment of preferred lists\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General provisions. (1)\n\nThe Chief Administrator of\nthe Courts shall place on a preferred list the names of all employees suspended\nor demoted from the same or similar positions in the same jurisdictional class\npaid by the same fiscal authority, in accordance with the provisions of section\n25.30\nof this Part. This preferred\nlist shall be used for filling vacancies in the same jurisdictional class paid\nby the same fiscal authority in the following order: first, in the same or\nsimilar position; second, in any position in a lower title in line of\npromotion; and third, in any position comparable to the lower title in line of\npromotion. Such position need not be in the same promotion unit or unit for\nsuspension or demotion as the employee's original position. Except as provided\nin paragraph (2) of this subdivision, no person shall be appointed from any\nother list for any such position until such preferred list is\nexhausted. (2)\n\nEmployees reassigned to positions in the Unified Court System pursuant to\nsection\n25.30\n(f) of this\n\nPart, and suspended employees who have accepted appointments from a preferred\nlist to positions other than their original positions pursuant to this section, may be reassigned to their original positions in their original courts or\ncourt-related agencies as vacancies occur, in order of seniority. The failure\nor refusal of an employee after reasonable notice to accept reassignment to\nsuch original position shall be deemed a relinquishment of his or her\neligibility for reassignment to such position pursuant to this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nThe\neligibility to be reinstated or reassigned pursuant to this subdivision shall\nnot continue for more than four years from the date of reassignment, suspension\nor demotion. (4)\n\nAn\nemployee who is eligible to be placed on a preferred list pursuant to this\nsection and who elects, as a member of a public employee retirement system, to\nretire upon a suspension or demotion, shall be placed on a preferred list and\nshall be eligible for reinstatement from such list. (b) Order of reinstatement from\npreferred lists. Persons on a preferred list who were suspended or demoted from\npositions in courts or court-related agencies paid by the same fiscal authority\nshall be reinstated therefrom to vacancies in appropriate positions in the\norder of their original appointment. The following exceptions shall apply: (1)\n\nWhere the vacancy exists in\na separate unit for suspension or demotion, persons suspended from or demoted\nin that unit shall be reinstated first. (2)\n\nNo person suspended or demoted\nbefore the completion of his or her probationary term shall be reinstated until\nthe reinstatement of all other persons on the preferred list. Upon\nreinstatement, the probationer shall be required to complete his or her\nprobationary term. (c) Salary upon reinstatement. A person\nreinstated from a preferred list to his or her former position or a similar\nposition at the same salary grade shall receive at least the same salary\nreceived at the time of suspension or demotion. (d) Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this Part, any person may voluntarily remove his or her name from\na preferred list by application to the Chief Administrator of the\n\nCourts. (e) Effect of\nrefusal or failure to accept reinstatement from preferred list. (1)\n\nThe failure or refusal of a\nperson on a preferred list after reasonable notice to accept reinstatement\ntherefrom to his or her former position, or any similar position in the same\nsalary grade for which such list is certified, shall be deemed to be a\nrelinquishment of his or her eligibility for reinstatement, and such name shall\nthereupon be stricken from such preferred list. The name of such person may be\nrestored to such preferred list, and certified to fill such appropriate\nvacancies as may thereafter occur, only upon the request of such person and\nsuch person's submission of reasons satisfactory to the Chief Administrator of\nthe Courts for his or her previous failure or refusal to accept\nreinstatement. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a person\non a preferred list shall not be deemed to relinquish eligibility for\nreinstatement therefrom by reason of a failure or refusal to accept\nreinstatement to a position in a different city or county from that in which\nthe former position was located, or to a position in a lower salary grade than\nthe position from which he or she was suspended, demoted or displaced. The name\nof such person may, however, be withheld from further certification for\nreinstatement to a position in such other city or county or in the same or a\nlower salary grade than the position to which he or she failed or refused to\naccept reinstatement. (3)\n\nThe restoration of the name of a\nperson to a preferred list, or restoration to eligibility for certification\ntherefrom to positions in any particular city or county or to positions in a\nlower salary grade than the former position, shall not invalidate or in any\nmanner adversely affect any appointment, promotion, reinstatement, displacement\nor demotion previously made to any position to which such person would\notherwise have been eligible for reinstatement from such preferred\nlist. (f) Disqualification for reinstatement. The Chief Administrator of the Courts may\ndisqualify for reinstatement from a preferred list, in the manner set forth in\nsubdivision 7 of section\n81\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, any person who is physically or mentally disabled from the\nperformance, with or without reasonable accommodation, of the essential\nfunctions of the position for which such list is established, or who has been\nguilty of such misconduct as would warrant his dismissal from the public\nservice. (g) Limitations of use of preferred list. A preferred list established pursuant to\nthis section shall have no priority with reference to a new position created by\nthe reclassification of an existing position pursuant to this Part whenever the\nuse of a preferred list for filling such new position would result in the\nsuspension of an employee pursuant to the provisions of section\n25.30\nof this Part. (h) The provisions of section\n25.26\nof this Part shall not apply\nto the implementation of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
