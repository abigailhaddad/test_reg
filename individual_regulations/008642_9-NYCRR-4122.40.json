  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4122.40 - Triple\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definition. The triple (or other approved name) is a pari-mutuel wager in which a bettor\nselects, in order, the first-, second- and third-place horses in a designated\ntriple race. The triple pool shall be held entirely separate from all other\npools and is not part of a daily double, exacta or other wagering\npool. (b) [Repealed]\n(c) Approval required. Races in which triple\npools are to be conducted are subject to approval by the commission and shall\nbe designated clearly in the program. (d) Design. The design of triple tickets\nshall be clearly and immediately distinguishable from other pari-mutuel\ntickets. (e) Scratch. If a horse is\nscratched or declared a nonstarter, no further triple tickets may be issued\ndesignating such horse, and all triple tickets previously issued designating\nsuch horse shall be refunded and the money deducted from the gross\npool. (f) Failure to select a\nwinning combination, short finishes. If no wager correctly selects the first\nthree horses in order, including when fewer than three horses finish the race, then those triple wagers selecting the first two placed horses in the correct\norder of finish shall be winning triple wagers, and if there are no such triple\ntickets, then triple tickets correctly selecting the winning horse to win shall\nbe winning triple wagers. If no triple tickets select the winning horse to win, then all triple tickets shall be refunded. (g) Dead heats. In the event of a dead heat\nor dead heats, all triple tickets selecting the correct order of finish, counting a horse in a dead heat as finishing in either position dead-heated, shall be winning triple tickets, and distribution shall be made in accordance\nwith established pari-mutuel practice governing dead heats. (h) Coupled entries and fields. Coupled\nentries and fields are permitted in triple races. In such races no wagers may\nbe accepted or issued (including \"wheel\" or \"box\" type bets) that couple the\nsame coupled entry or the same field in the same combination. (i) Display. This rule shall be prominently\ndisplayed throughout the betting area of each track conducting the triple and\nprinted copies of this rule shall be distributed by the track to patrons upon\nrequest. (j) Optional provisions. At its option, a track conducting a triple-pool race may accept nine horses to\nstart in such race. In the event fewer than five horses start, the triple wager\nshall be declared off and the gross pool refunded. With the approval of the\njudges, a track may schedule exacta wagering in place of triple wagering, if\ntime permits such a change. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
