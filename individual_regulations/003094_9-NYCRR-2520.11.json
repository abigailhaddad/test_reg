However, housing\naccommodations in buildings completed or substantially rehabilitated prior to\n\nJanuary 1, 1974, and whose rentals were previously regulated under the PHFL or\nany other State or Federal law, other than the RSL or the City Rent Law, shall\nbecome subject to the ETP A, the RSL and this Code, upon the termination of\nsuch regulation; (d) buildings\ncontaining fewer than six housing accommodations on the date the building first\nbecame subject to the RSL, unless such buildings are otherwise subject to this\n\nCode pursuant to the RSL or other statutes and regulations; for the purposes of\nthis subdivision, a building shall be deemed to contain six or more housing\naccommodations if it was part of a multiple family garden-type maisonette\ndwelling complex containing six or more housing accommodations having common\nfacilities such as a sewer line, water main or heating plant and was operated\nas a unit under common ownership on the date the building or complex first\nbecame subject to the RSL, notwithstanding that Certificates of Occupancy were\nissued for portions thereof as one- or two-family dwellings; (e) housing accommodations in buildings\ncompleted or buildings substantially rehabilitated as family units on or after\n\nJanuary 1, 1974, except such buildings which are made subject to this Code by\nprovision of the RSL or any other statute that meet the following criteria, which, at the DHCR's discretion, may be effectuated by operational bulletin: (1)\na specified percentage of at least 75\npercent, of listed building-wide and individual housing accommodation systems, must have been replaced; (2)\nthe\nrehabilitation must have been commenced in a building that was in a substandard\nor seriously deteriorated condition. Space converted from nonresidential use to\nresidential use shall not be required to have been in substandard or seriously\ndeteriorated condition for there to be a finding that the building has been\nsubstantially rehabilitated; (3)\nthe DHCR will not find the building to have been in a substandard or seriously\ndeteriorated condition where it can be established that the owner has attempted\nto secure a vacancy by an act of arson resulting in criminal conviction of the\nowner or the owner's agent, or there has been a finding of harassment by the\nDHCR or other governmental entity as defined pursuant to any applicable rent\nregulatory law, code or regulation. I f there has been a finding of harassment\nby a governmental entity other than the DHCR, that finding shall be considered\nto be in force for three years from the date the finding was made, unless proof\nof its being lifted is provided or otherwise obtained; (4)\nin order for there to be a finding of\nsubstantial rehabilitation, all building systems must comply with all\napplicable building codes and requirements, and the owner must submit copies of\nthe building's certificate of occupancy, if such certificate is required by\nlaw, before and after the rehabilitation; (5)\noccupied rent regulated housing\naccommodations shall remain rent regulated until vacated, notwithstanding a\nfinding that the remainder of the building has been substantially\nrehabilitated, and therefore qualifies for exemption from regulation; (6)\nwhere, because of the existence of\nhazardous conditions in his or her housing accommodation, a tenant has been\nordered by a governmental agency to vacate such housing accommodation, and the\ntenant has received a court order or an order of the DHCR that provides for\npayment by the tenant of a nominal rental amount while the vacate order is in\neffect, and permits the tenant to resume occupancy without interruption of the\nrent stabilized status of the housing accommodation upon restoration of the\nhousing accommodation to a habitable condition, such housing accommodation will\nbe excepted from any finding of substantial rehabilitation otherwise applicable\nto the building. However, the exemption from rent regulation based upon\nsubstantial rehabilitation will apply to a housing accommodation that is\nsubject to a right of re-occupancy, if the returning tenant subsequently\nvacates, or if the tenant who is entitled to return pursuant to court or DHCR\norder chooses not to do so and expresses such intent not to return in writing. The DHCR may waive the requirement that the tenant expresses a desire not to\nreturn in writing at its discretion if the owner demonstrates that the tenant\ncould not be found after the owner undertook a good faith effort to locate and\ncontact them, and the tenant has failed to make the nominal rent payment for a\nperiod of at least six months; (7)\nwhen an accommodation has been rendered uninhabitable and the tenant has\nreceived an order as described in paragraph (6) of this subdivision, the owner\nwill restore the building to a layout that is substantially similar to the\nbuilding layout prior to the building being rendered uninhabitable, unless the\nowner can demonstrate that doing so would be financially infeasible. If the\nowner does not restore the building to a layout that is substantially similar, tenants with orders described in paragraph (6) of this subdivision may, at\ntheir discretion, either accept a demolition stipend of an amount determined\npursuant to Rent Stabilization Code Section 2524.5 (a)(2)(ii)(b)(3) or begin a\nrent stabilized tenancy in a re-configured accommodation. In the event a tenant\nelects to move into a re-configured accommodation, the rent may be determined\nbased on local comparable stabilized rents; (8)\nan owner may apply to the DHCR for an\nadvisory prior opinion that the building will qualify for exemption from rent\nregulation on the basis of substantial rehabilitation, based upon the owner's\nrehabilitation plan; (9)\nspecified\ndocumentation will be required from an owner in support of a claim of\nsubstantial rehabilitation; (10)\nthe Applicant's lack of evidence for any reason, including passage of time, does not excuse the Applicant's obligation to substantiate the application as\nrequired by this section and any related operational bulletins.

(a) Where\ndeconversion occurs six years or more after the effective date of the\nconversion plan, the initial regulated rent shall be as agreed upon by the\nparties and reserved in a vacancy lease. (b) Where deconversion occurs within six\nyears after the effective date of the conversion plan, the initial regulated\nrent shall be the most recent legal regulated rent for the housing\naccommodation increased by all lawful adjustments that would have been\npermitted had the housing accommodation been continuously subject to the RSL\nand this Code. (c) Initial\nregulated rents established pursuant to clause (a) of this subparagraph shall\nnot be subject to challenge as a fair market rent appeal. (d) (1)\n\nWithin 30 days after deconversion, the new owner taking title upon deconversion\nshall offer a vacancy lease, at an initial regulated rent established pursuant\nto this subparagraph, to the holder of shares formerly allocated to the housing\naccommodation in the case of cooperative ownership, or the former unit owner in\nthe case of condominium ownership. Such shareholder or former unit owner shall have 90 days\nto accept such offer by entering into the vacancy lease.

(2)\n\nNo individual former owner or proprietary lessee shall be entitled to occupy\nmore than one housing accommodation. (ii)\n\nHousing accommodations occupied at the\ntime of deconversion and not subject to regulation under this Code at such\ntime. (a) Where the housing accommodation is\noccupied by a holder of shares formerly allocated to it in the case of\ncooperative ownership, or by the former owner of such unit in the case of\ncondominium ownership, such shareholder or former unit owner shall be offered a\nnew vacancy lease, subject to regulation under this Code, by the new owner\ntaking title upon deconversion, which lease shall be subject to all of the\nterms and conditions set forth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph pertaining\nto the establishment of initial regulated rents and lease offers. (b) Where the housing accommodation is\noccupied by a current renter pursuant to a sublease with the holder of shares\nformerly allocated to it in the case of cooperative ownership, or to the former\nowner of such unit in the case of condominium ownership, the new owner shall\noffer a vacancy lease to such holder of shares or former unit owner pursuant to\nall of the terms and conditions set forth in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (c) All shareholders or\nformer unit owners described in this subparagraph shall be offered a vacancy\nlease within 30 days after the deconversion, and shall have 90 days to accept\nsuch offer. However, in the event such shareholder or former unit owner does\nnot enter into the vacancy lease, he or she shall be deemed to have surrendered\nall rights to the housing accommodation effective 120 days after the failure to\naccept such offered vacancy lease. (iii)\n\nHousing accommodations occupied\npursuant to regulation under this Code or the City Rent and Eviction\n\nRegulations by non-purchasing tenants immediately prior to deconversion.

(iv)\n(a) Where it determines that the owner taking\ntitle at deconversion caused, in whole or in part, the deconversion to occur, the initial legal regulated rent shall be established by the DHCR pursuant to\nsections\n2522.6\nand\n2522.7\nof this Title. In such\ncases, subdivision (r) of this section shall not apply. (b) Upon deconversion, housing accommodations\nwhich were last subject to regulation pursuant to the City Rent and Eviction\n\nRegulations and were decontrolled prior to or pursuant to the conversion shall\nbecome subject to regulation under this Code pursuant to this paragraph. In\nsuch cases, the initial legal regulated rent shall be established by the DHCR\npursuant to sections\n2522.6\nand\n2522.7\nof this Title. (2)\n\nHousing\naccommodations that were subject to regulation under this Code or the City Rent\nand Eviction Regulations immediately prior to conversion to cooperative or\ncondominium ownership by virtue of the receipt of tax benefits pursuant to\napplicable law shall revert to regulation under this Code as is required by\napplicable law; (3)\n\nWhere\ncooperative or condominium ownership of such building no longer exists\n(deconversion) where the conversion of the building to cooperative or\ncondominium ownership is revoked by the New York State Attorney General, such\nhousing accommodations shall revert to regulation pursuant to the RSL, and this\n\nCode, and the legal regulated rents therefore shall be an amount set forth by\nthe Attorney General by order or negotiated settlement. If deconversion occurs\ndue to an action by the Attorney General and the Attorney General does not set\nrents, the rent for the housing accommodation shall be the lowest rent\ndetermined by the most recent legal regulated rent for the housing\naccommodation immediately prior to the conversion, increased by all lawful\nadjustments that would have been permitted had the housing accommodation been\ncontinuously subject to the RSL and this Code, or by the methods set forth in\n\nSection\n2522.6\n(b)(3)\nof\nthis Part.
