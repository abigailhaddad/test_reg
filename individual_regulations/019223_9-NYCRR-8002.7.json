  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8002.7 - Guidelines and procedures for the placement of certain sex offenders in the community\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chapter 568 of the Laws of 2008 requires the Division of Parole (DOP), the\n\nDivision of Probation and Correctional Alternatives (DPCA), and the Office of\n\nTemporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) to promulgate regulations to provide\nguidance concerning the placement and/or approval of housing for certain sex\noffenders. (b) The State has\npreviously enacted laws concerning sex offenders, including the Sex Offender\n\nRegistration Act, the Sex Offender Management and Treatment Act, the Electronic\n\nSecurity and Targeting of On-Line Predators Act (e-STOP) and laws restricting\ncertain sex offenders who are under probation or parole supervision from\nentering school grounds. Chapter 568 of the Laws of 2008 continues the State's\nefforts in the area of sex offender management and specifically in the area of\nthe placement and housing of sex offenders. Sex offender management, and the\nplacement and housing of sex offenders, are areas that have been, and will\ncontinue to be, matters addressed by the State. These regulations further the\n\nState's coordinated and comprehensive policies in these areas, and are intended\nto provide further guidance to relevant State and local agencies in applying\nthe State's approach. (c) Public\nsafety is a primary concern and these regulations are intended to better\nprotect children, vulnerable populations and the general public from sex\noffenders. The State's coordinated and comprehensive approach also recognizes\nthe necessity to provide emergency shelter to individuals in need, including\nthose who are sex offenders, and the importance of stable housing and support\nin allowing offenders to live in and re-enter the community and become\nlaw-abiding and productive citizens. These regulations are based upon, and are\nintended to further best practices and effective strategies to achieve these\ngoals. (d) In implementing this\nstatute and the State's comprehensive approach, DOP, DPCA, OTDA and the\n\nDivision of Criminal Justice Services' Office of Sex Offender Management (DCJS/\nOSOM) recognize that: (1)\nnot all sex\noffenders are equally dangerous. Some sex offenders may pose a high risk of\ncommitting a new sexual crime; others may pose only a low risk; (2)\nall reasonable efforts should be made in\nto avoid an ill-advised concentration of sex offenders in certain neighborhoods\nand localities. What constitutes such a concentration will depend on many\nfactors, and may vary depending on housing availability and the locality and\ncommunity. In addition, it is sometimes safer to house sex offenders together. Law enforcement, probation, and parole officers may more effectively monitor\noffenders, and service providers may more easily offer transitional services to\noffenders in these congregate settings. Further, some social service officials\nand departments rely on congregate housing for sex offenders who seek emergency\nshelter because of the limited, or lack of other housing options available for\nthis population. All public officials who are responsible for finding or\napproving housing for sex offenders should recognize that an over-concentration\nof sex offenders may create risks and burdens on the surrounding community, and\nthat their responsibility is to make judgments that are reasonable under the\ncircumstances; (3)\nall social\nservice districts are required by statute, regulation and directive to arrange\ntemporary housing assistance for eligible homeless individuals, including those\nwho are sex offenders; (4)\nto\nreduce recidivism it is important that offenders be able to re-enter society\nand become productive and law-abiding citizens whenever possible. A stable\nliving situation and access to employment and support services are important\nfactors that can help offenders to successfully re-enter society; (5)\nmaintaining and/or finding suitable\nhousing for sex offenders is an enormous challenge that impacts all areas of\nthe State. Offenders reside in all regions of the State and may have\nlong-established residences in their respective communities. Even offenders who\ndo not have such long-established relationships are often discharged from\nprison to the community where they previously lived. As a result, it is not\nappropriate for any one community or county to bear an inappropriate burden in\nhousing sex offenders because another community has attempted to shift its\nresponsibility for those offenders onto other areas of the State. The\nproliferation of local ordinances imposing residency restrictions upon sex\noffenders, while well-intentioned, have made it more challenging for the State\nand local authorities to address the difficulties in finding secure and\nappropriate housing for sex offenders; (6)\ndecisions as to the housing and\nsupervision of sex offenders should take into account all relevant factors and\nno one factor will necessarily be dispositive. These factors should include, but not be limited to, the factors enumerated in the statute, the risk posed by\nthe offender, the nature of the underlying offense, whether housing offenders\ntogether or apart is safer and more feasible, the most effective method to\nsupervise and provide services to offenders, and the availability of\nappropriate housing, employment, treatment and support. (e) Division of Parole staff shall apply the\nfollowing guidelines to the placement of a sex offender in the community upon\ntheir release from a New York State correctional facility when such offender\nhas been designated as a Level 2 or Level 3 offender pursuant to New York State\n\nSex Offender Registration Act, i.e., Correction Law article 6-C. These\nguidelines recognize that the placement of a sex offender within a community is\na considerable undertaking given the shortage of affordable housing in many\ncommunities, State law restricting the location of certain sex offenders in the\ncommunity and the movement of individuals subject to registration as a sex\noffender. Under these guidelines, the Division of Parole, through a community\npreparation process of investigation, seeks to enhance public safety and\nfacilitate the successful re-entry of offenders into their communities and\neffect the successful placement of eligible offenders into residential services\nthat can address identified needs. (f) Persons to be released on presumptive\nrelease, parole, conditional release or post-release supervision. (1)\n\nDivision of Parole staff will investigate\nthe proposed release program of all Level 2 and Level 3 sex offenders being\nreleased to the division's jurisdiction from any New York State correctional\nfacility with the objective of attaining the optimum residential placement that\nis available with the community proposed by the offender. As appropriate, such\ninvestigation shall include but not be limited to, consideration being given to\nthe following factors: (i) the sex offender's\nlevel of risk; (ii)\nthe\napplicability of Executive Law section 259-c(14); (iii)\nthe proximity of entities with\nvulnerable populations; (iv)\nthe\nlocation of other sex offenders required to register under the Sex Offender\n\nRegistration Act, specifically whether there is a concentration of registered\nsex offenders in a certain residential area or municipality; (v) the number, if any, of registered sex\noffenders at a particular property; (vi)\naccessibility to family members, friends\nor other supportive services, including, but not limited to, locally available\nsex offender treatment programs with preference for placement of such\nindividuals into programs that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing sex\noffender recidivism and increasing public safety; and\n(vii)\nthe availability of permanent, stable\nhousing in order to reduce the likelihood that such offenders will be\ntransient. (2)\n\nThe\napproval of a residential placement by Division of Parole staff will take into\nconsideration: (i) all relevant case\ninformation, including but not limited to the offender's criminal history and\npresent crime of conviction; (ii)\nthe investigation factors set forth in subparagraphs (1)(i) through (vi) of\nthis subdivision; and\n(iii)\nif\napplicable, the structure of the supervision plan and the services to be\nafforded through either the Division of Parole or some other entity within the\noffender's community; (iv)\nno one\nfactor shall be considered dispositive. (g) Persons released on presumptive release, parole, conditional release, post-release supervision or by maximum expiration\nof sentence where notice was provided to a local social services district\npursuant to Executive Law section 259-c(17). (1)\n\nWhen the Division of Parole is notified\nby a local social services district of its determination that a Level 2 or\n\nLevel 3 sex offender for whom a notice pursuant to Executive Law section\n259-c(17) was received by such district is in immediate need of shelter, and an\ninvestigation and approval of the potential residential placement by the\n\nDivision of Parole is required, the division shall investigate the district's\nproposed placement in accord with the factors set forth in subdivision (f) of\nthis section. Following such investigation, the Division of Parole shall\nprovide the local social services district with the results of its\ninvestigation and its approval or disapproval of the proposed\nplacement. (2)\n\nWhen an\ninvestigation by the Division of Parole is impracticable within the timeframe\nnecessary for the local social services district to meet the immediate housing\nneed of the offender, such investigation shall be completed within 48 hours of\nthe division's receipt of the local social services district's notice that such\nresidential placement was necessary. (i) The\n\nDivision of Parole's investigation of a local social services district's\nimmediate residential placement determination will take into consideration the\nfactors set forth in subdivision (f) of this section. Following such\ninvestigation, the Division of Parole shall provide the local social services\ndistrict with the results of its investigation and its approval or disapproval\nof the proposed placement.
