  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 451.6 - Staffing requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Group emergency foster care program(s)\nshall maintain minimum staffing according to the following: (1)\n\nThe program shall maintain a caseworker\nto child ratio of 1 to 10. In a situation where the number of children is not a\nmultiple of 10, an agency may use part-time staff to meet this\nrequirement. (2)\n\nThe program must\nmaintain at least one full-time child care supervisor. (3)\n\nStaff responsible for child care\nsupervision must be at a minimum level of one full-time child care worker for\neach five children in care during periods when children are awake. When the\nnumber of children in the program is not a multiple of five, up to two\nadditional children can be placed in a program without an additional worker. (For example, a program of 12 children would need two workers, whereas a\nprogram of 13 children would need an additional worker during times when\nchildren are awake.)\n(4)\n\nAt least\none child care worker shall be on duty in the program at all times. There shall\nbe an awake staff member on duty in the program during sleeping hours. If the\nprogram size is larger than 12 children, an additional staff member shall be\navailable on an as needed basis or on the premises of the facility where the\nprogram is operated. (5)\n\nThere\nshall be at least one recreation employee per program in addition to the child\ncare worker requirement under paragraph (3) of this subdivision. The recreation\nemployee shall be available outside regular school hours. (b) Exceptions to the staffing requirements\ncontained in this section for group emergency foster care programs may be\napproved by the department if an agency can demonstrate a convincing need to\nutilize staffing resources in a different manner. Any proposal for an exception\nshall be submitted in writing to the appropriate regional office of the\ndepartment for approval. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n451.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
