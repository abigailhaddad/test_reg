(1)\n\nAn employee shall be eligible for\ncoverage under the plan for himself and for his dependents, if any, subject to\nthe provisions of this Part and of the appropriate contracts applicable to\nemployees and their dependents. (2)\n\nNo employee may be covered under this plan until he has completed six months of\nservice following date of last entry into the service of the State or a\nparticipating employer. Each appointment, or election, or reinstatement\nfollowing a break in service, shall be considered a new entry into\nservice. (3)\n\nCoverage for any\nemployee and his dependents shall cease without notice upon termination of his\nstatus as an employee as defined in section\n74.1\nof this Part. The status of\nany person as an employee shall be deemed to terminate upon his severance from\nthe payroll for any reason, including retirement, except that for the purpose\nof continuing his coverage under the plan, the status of such person as an\nemployee shall be deemed to continue during any period of authorized leave\nwithout pay or during any other period of separation from the payroll for which\nthe employer continues contributions on behalf of the employee and his\ndependents. For the purpose of this plan, employees in vested status, on\npreferred lists or on seasonal layoff are not considered to be on leave without\npay. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding the\nforegoing, coverage under the plan for any person whose status as an employee\nterminates shall continue through the last day of the calendar month in which\nhis employment ceases. Coverage of his enrolled dependents shall continue for\nthe same period. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this Part, if the regular work schedule\nof an employee has been not less than half-time per week for at least one year\nand then is reduced to less than half-time per week under circumstances not\nexpressly excepted under section\n74.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart, the president may, in his or her discretion and upon the request of the\nemployer, deem such person's status as an employee to continue for a period not\nexceeding one year for the purpose of continued coverage under the plan. Thereafter, if the regular work schedule of such employee continues to be less\nthan half-time per week, the president may, from time to time, review the case\nand, in his or her discretion, grant extensions not exceeding one year each\nduring which such person's status as an employee may be deemed to\ncontinue. (6)\n\nIn the event both\nhusband and wife elect coverage under the plan as employees as defined in\nsection\n74.1\nof this Part, there shall be\ncoordination of benefits. (7)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this Part in the event of the death of\nan employee, the coverage hereunder of his dependents shall continue through\nthe last day of the calendar month in which death occurs. (b) Cessation of eligibility upon termination\nof the plan. Upon the termination of the plan by the State, the coverage and\neligibility for coverage of its employees shall cease as of the end of the last\nperiod for which the required contributions have been paid to the insurance\ncarrier. (c) Disqualification. The\npresident may disqualify from participation in the dental insurance plan and\nfrom receiving benefits thereunder any employee who has secured or attempted to\nsecure participation in the dental insurance plan or benefits under the plan\nfor himself or another by fraud, deception or a false statement of a material\nfact, or who has accepted benefits for himself or another knowing he was not\nentitled thereto. No person shall be disqualified or denied benefits pursuant\nto this subdivision unless he is first given a written statement of the reasons\ntherefor and afforded an opportunity to make an explanation and submit facts in\nopposition to such action. Such employees may be restored to eligibility for\ncoverage under the plan only on approval of the president and subject to such\nconditions as may be imposed by the president, including repayment of sums\nexpended for benefits obtained by fraud, deception or false statement of a\nmaterial fact, or accepted by the employee with knowledge that he was not\nentitled thereto.
