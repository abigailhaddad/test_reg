  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 §§ 272-2.2 - Availability of advertised items\n\nState Regulations\n\nNo person shall offer for sale at retail any food or food\nproduct at a stated price by means of any advertisement disseminated in a area\nserved by any of his stores or places of business which are covered by the\nadvertisement which do not have such products in stock, and readily available\nfor sale to customers during the effective period of the advertisement, unless\nthere is a clear and conspicuous disclosure in all such advertisements as to\nall exceptions and/or limitations or restrictions with respect to stores or\nplaces of business, products or prices otherwise included within the\nadvertisements. (a) If an advertised\nitem is not readily available, clear and adequate notice shall be provided that\nthe item is in stock and may be obtained upon request. (b) It shall constitute a defense to a charge\nunder this section if the retailer maintains records sufficient to show that\nthe advertised products were ordered in adequate time for delivery and\ndelivered to the stores or places of business in quantities sufficient to meet\nreasonably anticipated demands. (c) It shall also constitute a defense to a charge under this section if the\nretailer establishes that advertised products were actually ordered in good\nfaith, in quantities sufficient to meet reasonably anticipated demands, but\nwere not delivered due to circumstances beyond the retailer's control and not\nreasonably foreseeable by him. In determining whether the retailer acted in\ngood faith and with reasonable foresight, the commissioner shall consider all\ncircumstances surrounding the placement of the advertisement and the\nnondelivery of the product. The availability of \"rain checks\" shall be\nconsidered by the commissioner as a relevant factor, but the existence of a\n\"rain check\" policy, in and of itself, shall not constitute compliance with\nthis section.
