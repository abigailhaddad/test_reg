  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 32.6 - Verification of insurance coverage (validity of id cards)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Mandatory\nverification (MVF). Insurance companies shall respond to DMV initiated MVF\ntransactions in full accordance with the provisions of Part 34 of this Title. MVF transactions primarily represent the verification of ID cards when required\nelectronic proof of insurance is not posted to DMV's insurance information\ndatabase. The department may, as necessary, request specific verification of\ninsurance coverage from motorists as a result of occurrences that indicate\noperation of a motor vehicle such as accident reports, conviction certificates, and requests from the public or other agencies. Upon receipt of a response from\nthe motorist, the department shall initiate a MVF transaction to the identified\ninsurance company if DMV's insurance information database does not at that time\nconfirm insurance coverage. (b) Each insurance company shall provide the department with a single electronic\nvalue added network (VAN) mailbox address to receive MVF transactions as\nrequired by Part 34 of this Title. In addition, each insurance company shall\nprovide the commissioner with a single authorized name and mailing address, e-mail address and telephone number of a person designated to receive manual\nMVF transactions for dealer/transporter registrations and as may be otherwise\nrequired by the commissioner. Insurance companies shall respond to DMV\ninitiated electronic and manual verification of ID cards accepted by the\ndepartment within the prescribed return transactions specified by and in full\naccordance with the time frames set forth in Part 34 of this Title.
