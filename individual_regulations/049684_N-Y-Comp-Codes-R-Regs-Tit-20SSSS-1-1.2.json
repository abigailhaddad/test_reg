  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20§§ 1-1.2 - Corporation\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, sections 208(1), 209(2-a)\n(a) The term \"corporation\" means an entity\ncreated as such under the laws of the United States, any state, territory or\npossession thereof, the District of Columbia, or any foreign country, or any\npolitical subdivision of any of the foregoing, that provides a medium for the\nconducting of business and the sharing of its gains. An entity conducted as a\ncorporation is deemed to be a corporation. The term \"corporation\" includes: (1)\na domestic international sales\ncorporation (DISC), as defined in IRC section 992(a); (2)\na limited liability company or other\nbusiness entity classified as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes, except where otherwise provided; and\n(3)\n(i) an\nassociation, within the meaning of IRC section 7701(a)(3), a joint stock\ncompany or association, a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation\npursuant to I R C section 7704 and any business conducted by a trustee or\ntrustees wherein interest or ownership is evidenced by certificate or other\nwritten instrument. (ii)\n\nThe terms\"\njoint stock company\" and \"association\" include every unincorporated joint stock\nassociation, joint stock company or enterprise having written articles of\nassociation and capital stock divided into shares. The term \"association\"\nincludes a joint stock association. (iii)\nA business conducted by a trustee or\ntrustees in which interest or ownership is evidenced by certificate or other\nwritten instrument includes, but is not limited to, an association commonly\nreferred to as a business trust or Massachusetts trust. In determining whether\na trustee or trustees are conducting a business, the form of the agreement is\nof significance but is not controlling. The actual activities of the trustee or\ntrustees, not their purposes and powers, will be regarded as decisive factors\nin determining whether a trust is subject to tax under article 9-A. The mere\ninvestment of funds and the collection of income therefrom, with incidental\nreplacement of securities and reinvestment of funds, does not constitute the\nconduct of a business in the case of a business conducted by a trustee or\ntrustees. (b) There are generally three types of corporations - domestic corporations, foreign corporations, and alien corporations. (1)\n\nThe term \"domestic corporation\" means a\ncorporation incorporated by or under the laws of the state of New\n\nYork. (2)\n\nThe term \"foreign\ncorporation\" means a corporation that is not a domestic corporation. (3)\n\nThe term \"alien corporation\" means a\ncorporation organized under the laws of a country, or any political subdivision\nthereof, other than the United States, or organized under the laws of a\npossession, territory, or commonwealth of the United States. An alien\ncorporation is also considered a foreign corporation. (c) Unless otherwise specified, whenever the\nterm \"corporation\" is used in this Subchapter, it can refer to a taxpayer or a\nnon-taxpayer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
