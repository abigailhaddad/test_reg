Tit. 17 § 127.3 - General liability insurance requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nLiability insurance is required, not only for the\nprotection of the State of New York, but also as a means of assuring the\naccountability of permittees to the traveling public. Insurance policies are\nrequired to provide primary and non-contributory coverage for the State of New\n\nYork to cover claims that arise out of the permitted work/operations. Insurance\npolicies that remove or restrict blanket contractual liability located in the\n\"insured contract\" definition (as stated in section V, number 9, Item f in the\nISO CGL policy) so as to limit coverage against claims that arise out of permit\nwork, or that remove or modify the \"insured contract\" exception to the\nemployers liability exclusion, or that do not cover the additional insured for\nclaims involving injury to employees of the named insured or subcontractors, are not acceptable. The type and limits of liability insurance required from\npermittees shall vary depending upon the type of permit, the nature of the work\nbeing performed, and the dollar-value of the improvements, construction, work\nor operations.
