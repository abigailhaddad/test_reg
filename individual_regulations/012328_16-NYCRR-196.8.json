  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 196.8 - Classification of utilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the\npurpose of applying the system of accounts herein prescribed, municipal\nelectric utilities are hereby grouped into the following four classes: Class A. Utilities having average annual electric\noperating revenues of $500,000 or over\n\nClass B. Utilities having average annual electric\noperating revenues of $100,000 or over, but under $500,000\n\nClass C. Utilities having average annual electric\noperating revenues of $25,000 or over, but under $100,000\n\nClass D. Utilities having average annual electric\noperating revenues of less than $25,000\n(b) In order that frequent changes may be\navoided, the class to which any utility belongs may be determined by the\naverage of its annual electric operating revenues for the three fiscal years\nnext preceding the effective date of this system of accounts. If, at the end of\nany fiscal year following, the average of its annual electric operating\nrevenues for the three next preceding fiscal years is greater than the maximum\nfor the class in which the utility has been grouped, it shall automatically be\ngrouped in the higher class in which it falls because of such increased annual\nrevenues. Any utility engaged in new undertakings, the annual revenue from\nwhich is not known in advance, shall be classed in accordance with a reasonable\nestimate of its prospective revenues. (c) Any utility may, at its option, place\nitself in any group higher than the one in which it falls on the basis of its\naverage annual electric operating revenues. Notice of such action shall be\npromptly filed with the commission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n196.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
