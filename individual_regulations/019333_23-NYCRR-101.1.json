Tit. 23 § 101.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nPursuant to the Financial Services Law (FSL), the former New\n\nYork State Banking Department and the former New York State Insurance\n\nDepartment were consolidated on October 3, 2011 into the Department of\n\nFinancial Services (Department). Prior to the consolidation, assessments of\ninstitutions subject to the Banking Law (Banking Law) were governed by former\nsection\n17\nof the Banking Law. Effective October 3, 2011, assessments are\ngoverned solely by section 206 of the FSL.

The superintendent is authorized to assess regulated\nentities for its total costs attributable to such institutions in such\nproportions as the superintendent shall deem just and reasonable. This\nregulation sets forth the basis for allocating such expenses among regulated\nentities and the process for making such assessments. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
