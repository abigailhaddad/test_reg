  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 203-4.2 - Natural Gas actuated Pneumatic Devices and Pumps\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability: The requirements of this\nsection apply to natural gas actuated pneumatic devices and pumps located at\ncompressor stations. (b) Continuous\nbleed natural gas pneumatic devices: (1)\n\nBeginning January 1, 2023, continuous bleed natural gas pneumatic devices shall\nnot vent natural gas to the atmosphere except as described in 203-2.2(b)(2)(i)\nand shall comply with 203-4.2(b)(2)(ii)-(v) and the LDAR requirements specified\nin Subpart 203-7. (2)\n\nContinuous\nbleed natural gas actuated pneumatic devices installed prior to January 1, 2023\nmay be used provided they meet all of the following requirements as of January\n1, 2023: (i) No device shall vent natural gas\nat a rate greater than six (6) standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) when the\ndevice is idle and not actuating. (ii)\n\nAll devices must be clearly marked with\na permanent tag that identifies the natural gas flow rate as less than or equal\nto six (6) scfh. (iii)\n\nAll devices\nmust be tested by January 1, 2024 and then tested annually, no later than\nthirteen (13) months and no earlier than eleven (11) months from the previous\ntest using a direct measurement method (high volume sampling, bagging, calibrated flow measuring instrument); and, (iv)\n\nAny device with a measured emissions\nflow rate greater than six (6) scfh shall be successfully repaired within\nfourteen (14) days from the date of the initial emission flow rate\nmeasurement. (v) The owner or\noperator shall maintain a record of the flow rate measurement and shall report\nthe result to the Department within sixty (60) days after completed. (c) Continuous bleed\nnatural gas actuated pneumatic devices and pumps which need to be replaced or\nretrofitted to comply with the requirements specified shall do so by either: (1)\n\nCollecting all vented natural gas with\nthe use of a vapor collection system as specified in Subpart 203-8; or, (2)\n\nBy using compressed air or\nelectricity in lieu of natural gas to operate. (d) Intermittent bleed natural gas actuated\npneumatic devices: Beginning January 1, 2023, intermittent bleed natural gas\nactuated pneumatic devices shall comply with the LDAR requirements specified in\n\nSubpart 203-7 when the device is idle and not controlling. (e) Natural gas actuated pneumatic pumps: Beginning January 1, 2023, natural gas actuated pneumatic pumps shall not vent\nnatural gas to the atmosphere and shall comply with the LDAR requirements\nspecified in Subpart 203-7.
