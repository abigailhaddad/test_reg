  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 533.8 - Discontinuance of service to entire multiple dwellings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No waterworks corporation shall\ndiscontinue service to an entire multiple dwelling (as defined in the Multiple\n\nDwelling Law or the Multiple Residence Law) where the owner, person, firm or\ncorporation to whom or which the last preceding bill has been rendered, or from\nwhom or which the waterworks corporation has received payment therefor, has\nfailed to pay such utility bills, until it has complied with the following\nprocedure: (1)\n\nThe waterworks corporation must\ngive 15 days' written notice of its intention to so discontinue by personally\nserving such notice on the owner of the premises affected or on the person, firm, or corporation to whom or which the last preceding bill was rendered, or\nfrom whom or which the utility has received payment therefor, and on the\nsuperintendent or other person in charge of the building, if it can be readily\nascertained that there is such superintendent or other person in\ncharge. (2)\n\nThe waterworks\ncorporation must give 18 days' written notice to the owner, person, firm or\ncorporation specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision if such notice is\nmailed in a postpaid wrapper to the address of such person, firm or\ncorporation. (3)\n\nIn addition to the\nnotice prescribed by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, 15 days'\nwritten notice shall be posted in the public areas of such multiple dwelling, and 18 days' notice shall be mailed to the \"Occupant\" of each unit in that\nmultiple dwelling, to the local health officer and director of the social\nservices district for the political subdivision in which the multiple dwelling\nis located; if the multiple dwelling is located in a city or village, to the\nmayor thereof, or if there be none, to the manager; or, if the multiple\ndwelling is located in a town, then to the town supervisor; and to the county\nexecutive of the county in which the multiple dwelling is located, or if there\nbe none, then to the chairman of such county's legislative body. Notice to the\nmayors, managers, town supervisors, county executives, and chairmen of county\nlegislatures may be mailed to the persons specified therein or to their\ndesignees. Notice to health officers, directors of social services, mayors, managers, supervisors, county executives and chairmen of county legislatures\nshall be repeated not more than four working days nor less than two working\ndays prior to such discontinuance. (4)\n\nWhenever a notice of intention to\ndiscontinue water service has been made pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection and obligations owed the waterworks corporation have been satisfied, the waterworks corporation shall notify, in the same manner as it gave such\nnotice of intention, the occupant of each unit that the intention to\ndiscontinue water service no longer exists. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions contained\nin subdivision (a) of this section, no waterworks corporation shall discontinue\nservices to a multiple dwelling, where the owner, person, firm or corporation\nresponsible for making payment fails to pay utility bills, as long as occupants\nof such multiple dwellings continue to make timely payments for such service in\naccordance with procedures filed by the utility and approved by the Public\n\nService Commission. All notices referred to in subdivision (a) of this section\nshall contain the intended date of discontinuance of service and a utility\ncontact, including a telephone number, who will advise occupants of the amount\ndue for water service and who will arrange meetings with occupants to attempt\nto work out a mechanism for avoiding discontinuance of service in the event\nthat the owner continues to fail to make requisite payments or arrangements for\nsuch payments. The notice shall also refer to the provisions contained in\nsection 235-a of the New York Real Property Law authorizing occupants to\nsetoff, against their rent, payments to utilities in such\ncircumstances. (c) A waterworks\ncorporation, following the procedure outlined in subdivision (b) of this\nsection, may require occupants in a multiple dwelling to pay no more than the\ncurrent water charges incurred by the owner, person, firm or corporation to\nwhom or which the last preceding bill has been rendered or from whom or which\nthe utility has received payment therefor. A current charge, for purposes of\nthis section, means the amount properly billed the owner, etc., for water used\nduring the most recent billing period covered by the first bill rendered on or\nafter the date when the disconnect notice is issued. The current charges will\nnot include any arrears for earlier billing periods that may appear on such a\nbill. (d) If occupants in a\nmultiple dwelling find they are unable to reach an agreement with the utility\nto avoid discontinuance of service, they may contact the commission's water\ndivision. After such a request is received, a representative of the water\ndivision will attempt to work out such an agreement and will, if necessary, arrange a meeting with occupant representatives, the utility, and the owner, person, firm or corporation responsible for making payment for water service; provided, however, that such a meeting will be required only if the water\ndivision receives a written petition signed by at least 25 percent of the\noccupants in a multiple dwelling. (e) The water division may stay a threatened\ndisconnection of service to an entire multiple dwelling where it concludes that\ngood faith efforts are being made by the occupants to arrange for the payment\nof current water bills. (f) Whenever an owner of a multiple dwelling, or the person, firm or corporation\nresponsible for making payment for water service, fails to pay two consecutive\nbills for utility service by the time the third bill has been prepared, the\nutility must notify the commission within 15 days that it has invoked the\nprocedures outlined in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section. Unless\notherwise authorized, the notification should be in the form of a semimonthly\nreport filed with the water division. Such report should be cumulative, specify\nthe total amount due for each overdue account, the period of arrearage, and\nindicate if a notice of discontinuance has been sent. If these reports\ndemonstrate a need for changes in collection procedures, the division shall\nadvise the commission. (g) Sections\n533.3 through\n533.6\nof this Part shall be\napplicable with respect to the discontinuance of service to entire multiple\ndwellings. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
