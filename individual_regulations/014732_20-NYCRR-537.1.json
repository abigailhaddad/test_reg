  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 537.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Bulk sale. (1)\n\nThe term bulk sale as used in this Part\nmeans any sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of any part or the whole of\nbusiness assets, other than in the ordinary course of business, by a person\nrequired to collect tax and pay the same over to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (For definition of person required to collect tax, see section\n526.11\nof this Title.)\n\nExample 1:Corporation A, a person required to collect tax, sells its business assets to corporation B for $5,000. Such a sale is a bulk\nsale. (2)\n\nThe fact that a\nsale is or is not a retail sale does not determine whether such sale is a bulk\nsale. Example 2:Corporation A, a person required to collect tax, transfers all of its business assets to corporation B in exchange for stock in\ncorporation B. The transfer of corporation A's assets to corporation B is a\nbulk sale. Example 3:Corporation A, a person required to collect tax, sells its entire inventory which is purchased by corporation B for resale. The\nsale by A is a bulk sale. (3)\n\nThe fact that a transfer is by way of\ngift does not preclude such transfer from being a bulk sale. Example 4:A husband makes a gift of all his business assets\nto his wife. Such transfer is a bulk sale. (4)\n\nThe term bulk sale does not include: (i) sales, transfers or assignments of\nbusiness assets in settlement or realization of a valid lien, mortgage or other\nsecurity interest; (ii)\nsales, transfers or assignments of business assets by executors, administrators, receivers, trustees in bankruptcy or any public officer under judicial\nprocess. (b) Business assets. The term business assets as used in this Part means any assets\nof a business pertaining directly to the conduct of the business, whether such\nassets are intangible, tangible or real property. Any asset owned by a\ncorporation is a business asset. Example 5:An individual owns supermarket A and has the\nfollowing assets: store fixtures, delivery truck, the building occupied by the\nstore, and a vacant parcel of land not used by the business which is adjacent\nto the store and his house. All the above assets are business assets except the\nhouse and the parcel of land. Example 6:Assume the previous example, except that the\nbuilding owned by him contains both a store and his residence. The entire\nbuilding is a business asset. Example 7:A person in his own unincorporated business makes\na gift of cash to his son. The money is withdrawn from his business account and\nnot from his personal account. The cash is a business asset. (c) Seller. The term seller as used in this\n\nPart means any person required to collect tax who sells, transfers or assigns\nin bulk any of his business assets other than in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. (d) Ordinary course of\nbusiness. (1)\n\nThe phrase ordinary course of\nbusiness as used in this Part means any function, operation or transaction\nwhich is done ordinarily or customarily in the course of business. All the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the transaction must be examined to\nascertain whether the transaction is in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. (2)\n\nWhere a major part of\nthe business assets are sold, such sale is clearly not in the ordinary course\nof business and is a bulk sale. Where fungible items are sold in bulk or all\nthe items of a specific kind are sold, such sales would usually not be in the\nordinary course of business. Example 8:A clothing manufacturer transfers six of its\ndelivery vehicles as a trade-in on six new vehicles. The transaction is in the\nordinary course of business and not a bulk sale. Example 9:A machine shop sells some of its obsolete\nmachinery, and purchases new machinery. This transaction is in the ordinary\ncourse of business and is not a bulk sale. Example 10:A general merchandising store has a yearly\ninventory sale to its customers at markedly reduced prices in order to clear\nits old inventory and make room for new inventory. The sales to its customers\nare sales in the ordinary course of business and are not bulk sales. Example 11:A retail appliance store sells on credit. From\ntime to time, it sells its accounts receivables at the going rate of discount\nand purchases more inventory. Such sales are in the ordinary course of business\nand are not bulk sales. Example 12:An appliance store sells its trade fixtures to\ncompany A. The price at which the fixtures are sold is the fair market value of\nsuch fixtures, and the total assets of the seller are not diminished by the\nsale. Company A will lease the fixtures back to the appliance store for a\nstipulated rental for a 10-year term. This sale and leaseback is merely a\nfinancing arrangement which will not affect the business operations of the\nstore. The sale and leaseback of the fixtures is in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and is not a bulk sale. Example 13:Assume the facts in example 12, except that the\nprice is substantially less than fair market value and the total assets of the\nappliance store thereby become reduced. The sale and leaseback would not be in\nthe ordinary course of business and is therefore a bulk sale. Example 14:Assume the facts in example 12, except that, instead of a sale and leaseback of the trade fixtures, the fixtures are sold\nwithout any leaseback arrangements. This transaction would not be in the\nordinary course of business and is therefore a bulk sale. Example 15:A grocery store has a cash register which can\nautomatically record on tape the amount of sales tax collected, taxable items, the nature of the items sold, the cost of the items, the selling price and the\ninventory. The grocery store sells this cash register and purchases a less\ncomplex one. The sale of the cash register is in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and therefore is not a bulk sale. Example 16:A clothing store has 200 clothing racks. It\nremoves 20 racks from the floor and sells them. The sale of the 20 racks is in\nthe ordinary course of business and therefore is not a bulk sale. Example 17:Assume the same facts in example 16, except that\nthe store sells the racks together with other fixtures and equipment in a\nliquidation sale. The sale of the racks is a bulk sale. (e) Purchaser. The term purchaser\nas used in this Part means any person who, as part of a bulk sale, purchases or\nis the transferee or assignee of business assets. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
