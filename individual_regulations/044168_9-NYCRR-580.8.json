All parties shall be given sufficient opportunity to challenge his designation\nby filing the affidavit referred to in section 303 of the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act with the executive director, on notice to the hearing officer and\nthe other parties. (c) Upon receipt\nof a copy of the affidavit, the hearing officer and the other parties to the\nhearing may submit responding similar affidavits concerning bias or\ndisqualification.

(d) The executive director shall decide the\nchallenge within two business days of receipt of the affidavit and any\nresponding affidavits. If he deems the challenging affidavit insufficient, he\nmay either allow the party filing it to submit further written evidence, or he\nmay order that the proceedings continue. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
