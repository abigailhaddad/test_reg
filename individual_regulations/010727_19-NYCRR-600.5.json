  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 600.5 - Coastal policies\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn evaluating proposed actions against the following\npolicies, State agencies are strongly encouraged to consider the coastal policy\nexplanations and guidelines contained in the approved New York State Coastal\n\nManagement Program document. (a) Development policies. (1)\n\nRestore, revitalize\nand redevelop deteriorated and underutilized waterfront areas for commercial\nand industrial, cultural, recreational and other compatible uses. (2)\n\nFacilitate the siting of water-dependent\nuses and facilities on or adjacent to coastal waters. (3)\n\nEncourage the development of the State's\nexisting major ports of Albany, Buffalo, New York, Ogdensburg and Oswego as\ncenters of commerce and industry, and encourage the siting, in these port\nareas, including those under the jurisdiction of State public authorities, of\nland use and development which is essential to or in support of waterborne\ntransportation of cargo and people. (4)\n\nStrengthen the economic base of smaller\nharbor areas by encouraging the development and enhancement of those\ntraditional uses and activities which have provided such areas with their\nunique maritime identity. (5)\n\nEncourage the location of development in areas where public services and\nfacilities essential to such development are adequate, except when such\ndevelopment has special functional requirements or other characteristics which\nnecessitate its location in other coastal areas. (b) Fish and wildlife policies. (1)\n\nSignificant coastal fish and wildlife\nhabitats, as identified on the coastal area map, shall be protected, preserved\nand, where practical, restored so as to maintain their viability as\nhabitats. (2)\n\nExpand recreational\nuse of fish and wildlife resources in coastal areas by increasing access to\nexisting resources, supplementing existing stocks and developing new resources. Such efforts shall be made in a manner which ensures the protection of\nrenewable fish and wildlife resources and considers other activities dependent\non them. (3)\n\nFurther develop\ncommercial finfish, shellfish and crustacean resources in the coastal area by: (i) encouraging the construction of new or\nimprovement of existing onshore commercial fishing facilities; (ii)\nincreasing marketing of the State's\nseafood products; and\n(iii)\nmaintaining adequate stocks and expanding aquaculture facilities. Such efforts\nshall be made in a manner which ensures the protection of such renewable fish\nresources and considers other activities dependent on them. (4)\n\nIce management practices shall\nnot damage significant fish and wildlife and their habitats, increase shoreline\nerosion or flooding, or interfere with the production of hydroelectric\npower. (c) Agricultural\nlands policy. To conserve and protect agricultural lands in the State's coastal\narea, an action shall not result in a loss nor impair the productivity of\nimportant agriculture lands as identified on the coastal area map, if that loss\nor impairment would adversely affect the viability of agriculture in an\nagricultural district or, if there is no agricultural district, in the area\nsurrounding such lands. (d) Scenic\nquality policies. (1)\n\nPrevent impairment of\nscenic resources of statewide significance, as identified on the coastal area\nmap. Impairment shall include: (i) the\nirreversible modification of geological forms, the destruction or removal of\nvegetation, the destruction or removal of structures, wherever the geologic\nforms, vegetation or structures are significant to the scenic quality of an\nidentified resource; and\n(ii)\nthe\naddition of structures which because of siting or scale will reduce identified\nviews or which because of scale, form or materials will diminish the scenic\nquality of an identified resource. (2)\n\nProtect, restore and enhance natural and\nman-made resources which are not identified as being of statewide significance, but which contribute to the scenic quality of the coastal area. (e) Public access policies. (1)\n\nProtect, maintain and increase the levels\nand types of access to public water-related recreation resources and facilities\nso that these resources and facilities may be fully utilized by all the public\nin accordance with reasonably anticipated public recreation needs and the\nprotection of historic and natural resources. In providing such access, priority shall be given to public beaches, boating facilities, fishing areas\nand waterfront parks. (2)\n\nAccess to\nthe publicly owned foreshore and to lands immediately adjacent to the foreshore\nor the water's edge that are publicly owned shall be provided, and it should be\nprovided in a manner compatible with adjoining uses. Such lands shall be\nretained in public ownership. (f) Recreation policies. (1)\n\nWater dependent and water-enhanced\nrecreation shall be encouraged and facilitated and shall be given priority over\nnonwater-related uses along the coast, provided it is consistent with the\npreservation and enhancement of other coastal resources and takes into account\ndemand for such facilities. In facilitating such activities, priority shall be\ngiven to areas where access to the recreation opportunities of the coast can be\nprovided by new or existing public transportation services and to those areas\nwhere the use of the shore is severely restricted by existing\ndevelopment. (2)\n\nDevelopment, when\nlocated adjacent to the shore, shall provide for water-related recreation, as a\nmultiple use, whenever such recreational use is appropriate in light of\nreasonably anticipated demand for such activities and the primary purpose of\nthe development. (3)\n\nProtect, enhance and restore structures, districts, areas or sites that are of\nsignificance in the history, architecture, archeology or culture of the State, its communities or the nation. (g) Flooding and erosion hazards policies. (1)\n\nWhenever possible, use nonstructural\nmeasures to minimize damage to natural resources and property from flooding and\nerosion. Such measures shall include: (i) the\nsetback of buildings and structures; (ii)\nthe planting of vegetation and the\ninstallation of sand fencing and drainage systems; (iii)\nthe reshaping of bluffs; and\n(iv)\nthe flood-proofing of buildings or their\nelevation above the base flood level. (2)\n\nMining, excavation or dredging in coastal\nwaters shall not significantly interfere with the natural coastal processes\nwhich supply beach materials to land adjacent to such waters and shall be\nundertaken in a manner which will not cause an increase in erosion of such\nland. (3)\n\nThe construction or\nreconstruction of erosion protection structures shall be undertaken only if\nthey have a reasonable probability of controlling erosion for at least 30 years\nas demonstrated in design and construction standards and/or assured maintenance\nor replacement programs. (4)\n\nActivities or development in the coastal area will be undertaken so as to\nminimize damage to natural resources and property from flooding and erosion by\nprotecting natural protective features, including beaches, dunes, barrier\nislands and bluffs. Primary dunes will be protected from all encroachments that\ncould impair their natural protective capacity. (5)\n\nActivities and development, including the\nconstruction or reconstruction of erosion protection structures, shall be\nundertaken so that there will be no measurable increase in erosion or flooding\nat the site of such activities or development or at other locations. (6)\n\nPublic funds shall only be used for\nerosion protective structures where necessary to protect human life, and new\ndevelopment which requires a location within or adjacent to an erosion hazard\narea to be able to function, or existing development; and only where the public\nbenefits outweigh the long-term monetary and other costs, including the\npotential for increasing erosion and adverse effects on natural protective\nfeatures. (h) Water\nresources policies. (1)\n\nState coastal area\npolicies and purposes of approved local waterfront revitalization programs will\nbe considered while reviewing coastal water classifications and while modifying\nwater quality standards; however, those waters already overburdened with\ncontaminants will be recognized as being a development constraint. (2)\n\nEncourage the use of alternative or\ninnovative sanitary waste systems in small communities where the costs of\nconventional facilities are unreasonably high, given the size of the existing\ntax base of these communities. (3)\n\nBest management practices will be used to ensure the control of stormwater\nrunoff and combined sewer overflows draining into coastal waters. (4)\n\nDischarge of waste materials from vessels\ninto coastal waters will be limited so as to protect significant fish and\nwildlife habitats, recreational areas and water supply areas. (5)\n\nBest management practices will be\nutilized to minimize the non-point discharge of excess nutrients, organics and\neroded soils into coastal waters. (i) To safeguard the vital economic, social\nand environmental interests of the State and of its citizens, proposed major\nactions in the coastal area must give full consideration to those interests, and to the safeguards which the State has established to protect valuable\ncoastal resource areas.
