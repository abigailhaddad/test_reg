  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 70.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe provisions of this Part are limited to insurance companies authorized, pursuant to subdivisions 13 and 14 of section\n1113 (a)\nof the Insurance Law, to write medical malpractice insurance. Such limitation is appropriate since it has been determined after review and a public hearing that applicability to other areas of professional liability insurance is unnecessary at this time. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n70.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
