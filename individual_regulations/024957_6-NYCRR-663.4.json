  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 663.4 - Regulatory procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All\npersons proposing to conduct, on wetlands or adjacent areas, activities which\nhave not been specifically exempted under section 24-0701 of the act, in the\nstatewide minimum land use regulations or under section\n663.3, 663.4\n(d) or\n663.7\nof this Part, must obtain\neither a permit or a letter of permission. (b) Preapplication procedures. (1)\n\nInformation on whether an activity\nrequires either a permit or a letter of permission, or whether the activity is\nexempt from regulation, is provided in the statewide minimum land use\nregulations for freshwater wetlands and in subdivision (d) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nIf a person wishing to\nconduct an activity is in doubt about whether the activity is exempt or about\nwhich procedural requirement applies, or wants to discuss with the department\nany phase of the proposed project as it relates to the act or to other permit\nprograms, that person should contact the appropriate regional permit\nadministrator for a preapplication conference. (3)\n\nAny person intending to submit an\napplication for a permit or letter of permission in the course of a\npreapplication conference, request in writing, in a form and manner prescribed\nby the department, that the commissioner confirm the classification, done\npursuant to Part 664 of this Title, of the wetland that would be affected by\nthe proposed activity. Within 20 working days of the department's receipt of\nthe request, the commissioner will decide either to confirm the existing\nclassification or to revise the classification on the basis of material new\ninformation or materially changed wetland conditions. Within that same 20-day\nperiod, the department shall send notice of the decision confirming or revising\nthe classification to the person who submitted the request. That person shall\nnot file a permit application until such notice has been provided. Where a\nclassification is revised, notice of the order setting forth the revised\nclassification will also be given and published, and a copy of such order shall\nbe filed, as provided in Part 664 of this Title. Once the wetland's\nclassification has been confirmed or revised pursuant to this paragraph and the\nprocedures set out in Part 664 of this Title, and the permit application that\nwas the subject of the preapplication conference has been filed, no further\ndepartment-initiated change in the wetland's classification shall change the\nstandard for permit issuance applied to that application. (c) Regulatory mechanisms and\napplication procedures. The form to be used in applying for either a permit or a\nletter of permission is available from each regional office of the department, and the completed application form should be submitted to the appropriate\nregional permit administrator. The procedures for the two types of permission\nare as follows: (1)\n\nPermits. The procedures and schedules, including those for notices\nand hearings, that both an applicant and the department must follow in the\npermit application process are detailed in the Uniform Procedures Law (article\n70 of the Environmental Conservation Law) and applicable regulations (Part 621\nof this Title), and in the State Environmental Quality Review Act (article 8 of\nthe Environmental Conservation Law) and applicable regulations (Part 617 of\nthis Title). The department's regional permit administrators are available to\nexplain the requirements of the uniform procedures regulations. In addition, the department will notify the applicant if the proposed activity is subject to\nthe requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act, Waterfront\n\nRevitalization and Coastal Resources Act and/or State Historic Preservation\n\nAct, and will indicate which of those requirements apply. See also section\n663.9\nof this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nLetters of\npermission. The abbreviated letter of permission procedures are\napplicable when the department has determined that the proposed activity will\nnot substantially alter or impair the natural functions or benefits of a\nwetland. If, after consulting the chart in subdivision (d) of this section, an\napplicant deems that a letter of permission is appropriate for the proposed\nactivity, that should be indicated on the application form submitted. The\nadvantages of a letter of permission are that no application fee or public\nhearing is required and that the letter of permission, if it is granted, is\ngranted within 20 calendar days of the department's receipt of a properly\ncompleted application. The issuance of a letter of permission allows an\napplicant to proceed without a permit. However, to ensure that the activity to\nbe covered by an issued letter of permission does not exceed the thresholds\nidentified in the activities chart in subdivision (d) of this section, the\ndepartment may attach to the letter of permission a statement of any necessary\nconditions to the proposed activity. If the proposed activity does not qualify\nfor a letter of permission and a permit is required instead, the department\nwill notify the applicant in writing within 15 calendar days and will require\nthe appropriate permit processing fee and any additional information necessary\nto make the application complete, in accordance with the Uniform Procedures Law\nand its regulations. (d) Activities chart. Guidelines and procedural requirements for various\nactivities are given in this subdivision. This chart is included to assist\napplicants and permit application reviewers in determining regulatory\nrequirements under the act and this Part. To further assist applicants, the\nrelative compatibility with wetlands and their adjacent areas, of the various\nactivities, as determined in the statewide minimum land use regulations\ncontained in section\n665.7\n(g) of this\n\nTitle, are included in parentheses whenever a permit requirement is\nindicated. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIOUS\nACTIVITIES\nThe statewide minimum land use regulations contained in\nsection\n665.7\n(g) of this\n\nTitle establish the compatibility categories to be used in conjunction with the\ndifferent types of land use activities to be conducted upon freshwater wetlands\nor adjacent areas. This chart states the procedural requirements to be followed\nin implementing those minimum land use regulations. For activities and land\nuses not shown on this chart, the department must first make a determination\nthat the activity is a regulated activity as defined in the act and section\n663.2\nof this Part. If the activity\nis regulated, then an independent determination of compatibility using the\nthree tests for compatibility contained in the standards for permit issuance in\nsection\n663.5\n(e) of this\n\nPart must be used. Area Categories: Levels of Procedural\n\nRequirements: FWW - Freshwater wetland\nE - Exempt; no permit or letter of permission\nrequired\nAA - Adjacent area\nL - Letter of permission required\nP - Permit required\n\nLevels of Compatibility: C -\nUsually compatible\nmeans that a\nregulated activity may be compatible with a wetland and its functions and\nbenefits, although in some circumstances the proposed action may be\nincompatible. N -\nUsually incompatible\nmeans that a\nregulated activity is usually incompatible with a wetland and its functions or\nbenefits, although in some cases the proposed action may be insignificant\nenough to be compatible. X -\nIncompatible\nmeans that a regulated\nactivity is incompatible with a wetland and its functions and benefits. Exempt Activities\n\nThe following activities either have\nbeen exempted from regulation by the act or are not regulated because they will\nnot substantially impair any of the functions and benefits of freshwater\nwetlands. Procedure and Compatibility by\n\nArea\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n1. Continuing lawfully existing uses and continuing\nall activities normally and directly associated with any such use, except for\nthose activities covered by items 38, 39, 40 and 41, where such continuance\ndoes not involve expansion or significant alteration of the existing use and\ndoes not affect additional wetland area. E\nE\n2. Establishing scenic, historic, wildlife and\nscientific preserves, where no significant impairment of the wetland or its\nbenefits is involved. E\nE\n3. Boating, hiking, swimming, camping, picnicking and\nother similar nonmotorized forms of outdoor activity, where no significant\nimpairment of the wetland or its benefits is involved. E\nE\n4. Depositing or removing the natural products of\nwetlands in the process of recreational or commercial fishing, shellfishing, aquiculture, hunting or trapping, including the erection and maintenance of\ntemporary hides or blinds. E\nE\n5. Conducting educational and scientific research\nactivities where no significant impairment of the wetland or its benefits is\ninvolved. E\nE\n6. Establishing walking trails, where no significant\nimpairment of the wetland or its benefits involved. E\nE\n7. Establishing an individual recreational\nmooring. E\nE\n8. Gathering fuelwood, except as covered by items 22, 23 and 24. E\nE\n9. Conducting an agricultural activity, as defined in\nthe act or section\n663.2\nof this Part. E\nE\nExisting Structures and\n\nFacilities\n\nNormally, maintenance, repair or\nrestoration of existing facilities will not cause adverse impacts on wetlands. This is not always true, however, for construction activities that are\nassociated with such maintenance, repair or restoration, such as the placing of\naccess roads, staging areas and utilities. Various such associated activities\nare listed elsewhere in this chart. Expansion or substantial restoration or\nreconstruction of existing structures and facilities can have significant\nimpacts on the functions and benefits of wetlands. These impacts can be greater\nthan those caused by the total replacement of the structures or facilities or\nby their construction in a different location. Procedure and Compatibility by\n\nArea\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n10. Ordinary maintenance and repair of existing\nfunctional structures, facilities or improved areas, including but not limited\nto bridges, roads, highways, culverts, railroad beds, bulkheads, docks, beaches, piers, wharves, pilings, dolphins, utility rights-of-way, buildings, landscaped or paved areas, lawns and mosquito control ditches. Such maintenance\nand repair might include, for example, replacing broken boards in docks, repainting structures, redriving pilings, resurfacing paved areas, and\ninstalling and removing docks on a seasonal basis, but does not include\nactivities covered by items 22, 23, 24, 38, 39, 40 and 41 or other applicable\nitems listed in this chart. E\nE\n11. In-kind and in-place replacement of existing\nfunctional bulkheads and similar structures. L\nL\n12. Routine beach regrading and cleaning. L\nL\n13. Restoring, reconstructing, expanding or modifying\nexisting functional structures or facilities which involves a temporary\ndisturbance of less than 50 square meters (approximately 540 square feet) of\nground surface. P(C)\nL*\n14. Expanding or substantially modifying existing\nfunctional structures or facilities, except for activities covered by item 13, 19 or 30. P(N)\nP(C)\n\nOperating Motor\n\nVehicles\n\nIntense use of motor vehicles may\nimpair any of the several functions and benefits of wetlands by introducing or\nincreasing contaminants, noise or other forms of pollution, or by removing or\nreducing vegetation and exposing soil to erosion. Occasional use generally does\nnot warrant regulation. 15. Operating all-terrain vehicles, air and motor\nboats, and snowmobiles, except as described in item 16. E\nE\n16. Intensive, organized and repetitive use of\nall-terrain vehicles, air and motor boats, and snowmobiles. P(N)\nP(C)\n\nDraining, Filling, Grading, Clear-cutting and Dredging\n\nGenerally, draining of wetlands lowers\ngroundwater levels, may increase downstream peak flows, and may decrease water\nstorage capacity and downstream base flow. It may also cause changes in\nvegetation and water temperature, increased stream bed scouring, and sediment\ndeposition. Draining can totally destroy a wetland. Filling decreases the number and size\nof wetlands, thereby decreasing their ability to collect runoff and prevent\nerosion and sediment deposition downstream. Certain fill materials may\nadversely affect water quality. Disposal of dredged material may result in\nerosion and cause turbidity and sediment deposition. Filling eliminates wetland\nhabitat for fish and wildlife, may alter the water table and groundwater flow\nand adversely affect groundwater recharge, and can irreversibly destroy a\nwetland. Grading a wetland or adjacent area can\nsubstantially alter surface water drainage and flow patterns, may temporarily\nincrease erosion, and may eliminate fish and wildlife habitat. Clear-cutting removes the vegetative\ncover of wetlands and may reduce their ability to absorb water and serve as\nhabitat. It may also cause soil erosion. Dredging or excavation may increase\nwater depth and remove wetland vegetation, thus altering the basic\ncharacteristics of, and perhaps destroying, wetlands. Fish and wildlife feeding\nor reproductive capacities may be altered, as may cover types, turbidity, sediment deposition, and erosion patterns. Any of these activities can cause the\npermanent loss of benefits provided by wetlands, and may, in fact, destroy\nwetlands entirely. Procedure and Compatibility by\n\nArea\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n17. Draining and altering water levels, except as part\nof an agricultural activity. P(X)\nP(X)\n18. Removing or breaching beaver dams. P(N)\nP(C)\n19. Constructing, expanding or substantially modifying\ndrainage ditches, except as part of an agricultural activity. P(X)\nP(N)\n20. Filling, including filling for agricultural\npurposes. P(X)\nP(N)\n21. Installing or creating a dry well, retention basin, filter, open swale, or pond. P(N)\nP(N)\n22. Clear-cutting timber. P(N)\nP(C)\n23. Clear-cutting vegetation other than trees, except\nas part of an agricultural activity. P(X)\nP(N)\n24. Cutting but not elimination or destruction of\nvegetation, such that the functions and benefits of the wetland are not\nsignificantly adversely affected. L\nL\n25. Grading, and dredging not included in item 26. P(X)\nP(N)\n26. Dredging less than 400 cubic meters (approximately\n523 cubic yards) to maintain present navigation channels. P(C)\nP(C)\n27. Mining. P(X)\nP(X)\n28. Constructing roads, except for winter truck roads\nas described in section\n663.2\n(c) of this\n\nPart. P(X)\nP(N)\n29. Drilling a water well to serve an individual\nresidence. P(C)\nL\n30. Drilling a well, except for activities covered by\nitem 29. P(X)\nP(N)\n\nDams, Docks and\n\nBulkheads\n\nGenerally, structures of this type are\nindicative of associated development which may increase disruptive human use or\noccupancy of wetland areas. A structure sometimes interferes with\nsurface or subsurface water flow, increases water levels, or otherwise affects\nwetland water supply. The impact of such a structure is related to its size, location and design. For example, docks on piles are generally more compatible\nwith the functions and benefits of wetlands than are docks on fill. Dams alter normal flow patterns and\noften increase water levels, thus eliminating or altering the natural\nvegetation. Depending on the size of the structure, entire wetlands can be\ndestroyed. Procedure and Compatibility by\n\nArea\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n31. Installing a dock, pier, wharf or other structure\nbuilt on floats or open-work supports and having a top surface area of 20\nsquare meters (approximately 200 square feet) or less. P(C)\nP(C)\n32. Installing any dock, pier, wharf or other structure\nused as a landing place on water, except for activities covered by item\n31. P(N)\nP(N)\n33. Constructing groins, bulkheads and other shoreline\nstabilization structures. P(X)\nP(N)\n34. Constructing or removing berms, levees, dikes, dams\nand other control structures. P(X)\nP(N)\n\nUtilities\n\nInstalling utilities in or adjacent to\nwetlands will be presumed to cause less damage to those wetlands if little or\nno additional clearing and grading is necessary. Where extensive clearing and\nconstruction of access or maintenance roads occurs, erosion and sedimentation\nmay be the most serious problems. Installing overhead lines, while often\nspanning wetlands and thereby minimizing construction impacts, will result in a\npermanent adverse aesthetic impact on wetlands. Overhead power lines may also\nresult in higher bird mortality rates, either through collision or\nelectrocution. 35. Installing utility service to an individual\nresidence. L\nE\n36. Installing electric, telephone or other utilities\nfrom an existing utility distribution facility to a structure, except for\nactivities covered by item 35, where no major modifications or construction\nactivities in the wetland are necessary. P(C)\nL\n37. Installing utilities, except for activities\nregulated by article VII or VIII of the Public Service Law or by item 36. P(X)\nP(N)\n\nPollution and\n\nPesticides\n\nIntroduction of sewage effluent, runoff\nof pesticides, or disposal of toxic substances into wetlands or adjacent areas\nmay contaminate ground and surface water with undesirable chemicals, nutrients\nand organisms. The contamination may be temporary or permanent. It may result\nfrom activities located directly in wetlands or within adjacent areas, but, due\nto runoff and drainage patterns, it may also be caused by activities located\nsome distance away. Distant activities can have adverse effects as severe as\nthose caused by activities within or adjacent to wetlands. The presence of\npollutants or pesticides in wetlands or adjacent areas may increase mortality\nrates among fish and wildlife, alter their behavior or reproductive capability, and adversely affect their value as a food source. Excessive nutrients alter\nvegetative cover, fish and wildlife distribution, and water potability. Resulting organisms may also create a health hazard. Procedure and Compatibility by\n\nArea\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n38. Introducing or storing any substance, including any\nchemical, petrochemical, solid waste, nuclear waste, toxic material, sewage\neffluent or other pollutant, except as described in items 39, 40 and 41. P(X)\nP(X)\n39. Application of a pesticide conducted pursuant to a\npermit issued under article 15 of the Environmental Conservation Law (see 6\nNYCRR Parts\n327, 328\nand\n329\n). P(N)\nP(C)\n40. Application of a pesticide where no permit is\nrequired under article 15 of the Environmental Conservation Law (see 6 NYCRR\nParts\n327, 328\nand\n329\n). P(X)\nP(X)\n41. Application of a pesticide to the grounds of a\nprivate residence when such use is by the owner. P(C)\nL\nBuildings\n\nConstructing buildings, accessory\nroads, and parking areas can have several effects on wetlands, not the least of\nwhich is the increased pressure to continue development beyond the initial\nconstruction. Roofs and paved areas quickly shed rain\nwhere that rain previously had an opportunity to soak into the ground. This can\nresult in more turbulent streamflow, more erosion and sedimentation, and higher\nwater levels in surrounding areas, including in nearby wetlands. The effects of filling, grading and\ndraining are discussed elsewhere in this chart. 42. Constructing a residence or related structures or\nfacilities. P(X)\nP(N)\n43. Constructing commercial or industrial facilities, public buildings, or related structures or facilities.
