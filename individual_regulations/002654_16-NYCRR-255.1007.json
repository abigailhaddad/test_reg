  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.1007 - Required elements of a GDPIM plan\n\nState Regulations\nA written GDPIM plan must contain procedures for\ndeveloping and implementing the following elements: (a) Knowledge. An operator must demonstrate\nan understanding of its gas distribution system developed from reasonably\navailable information. (1)\n\nIdentification of\nthe characteristics of the pipeline's design and operations and the\nenvironmental factors that are necessary to assess the applicable threats and\nrisks to its gas distribution pipeline. (2)\n\nConsideration of the information gained\nfrom past design, operations, and maintenance. (3)\n\nIdentification of the additional\ninformation needed and provide a plan for gaining that information over time\nthrough normal activities conducted on the pipeline (for example, design, construction, operations or maintenance activities). (4)\n\nDevelopment and implementation of a\nprocess by which the GDPIM program will be reviewed periodically and refined\nand improved as needed. (5)\n\nProvision for the capture and retention of data on any new pipeline installed. The data must include, at a minimum, the location where the new pipeline is\ninstalled and the material of which it is constructed. (b) Identify threats. The operator must\nconsider the following categories of threats to each gas distribution pipeline: (1)\ncorrosion (including atmospheric\ncorrosion); (2)\nnatural\nforces; (3)\nexcavation\ndamage; (4)\nother outside force\ndamage; (5)\nmaterial, weld or joint\nfailure (including compression coupling); (6)\nequipment failure; (7)\nincorrect operation; and\n(8)\nother concerns that could threaten the\nintegrity of its pipeline. An operator must consider reasonably available\ninformation to identify existing and potential threats. Sources of data may\ninclude, but are not limited to, incident and leak history, corrosion control\nrecords (including atmospheric corrosion records), continuing surveillance\nrecords, patrolling records, maintenance history, and excavation damage\nexperience. (c) Evaluate\nand rank risk. An operator must evaluate the risks associated with its\ndistribution pipeline. In this evaluation, the operator must determine the\nrelative importance of each threat and estimate and rank the risks posed to its\npipeline. This evaluation must consider each applicable current and potential\nthreat, the likelihood of failure associated with each threat, and the\npotential consequences of such a failure. An operator may subdivide its\npipeline into regions with similar characteristics (e.g., contiguous areas\nwithin a distribution pipeline consisting of mains, services and other\nappurtenances; areas with common materials or environmental factors), and for\nwhich similar actions likely would be effective in reducing risk. (d) Identify and implement measures to\naddress risks. Determine and implement measures designed to reduce the risks\nfrom failure of its gas distribution pipeline. These measures would include an\neffective leak management program as required by sections\n255.805\nthrough\n255.821\nof this Part, unless all\nleaks are repaired when found. (e) Measure performance, monitor results, and evaluate effectiveness. (1)\n\nDevelop and monitor performance measures\nfrom an established baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of its GDPIM\nprogram. An operator must consider the results of its performance monitoring in\nperiodically re-evaluating the threats and risks. These performance measures\nmust include the following: (i) number of\nhazardous leaks either eliminated or repaired or total number of leaks if all\nleaks are repaired when found, categorized by cause; (ii)\nnumber of excavation damages; (iii)\nnumber of excavation tickets (receipt\nof information by the underground facility operator from the one-call\nnotification center pursuant to Part 753 Protection of Underground Facilities, Subpart 753-5 One-Call Notification Systems of this Title); (iv)\ntotal number of leaks either eliminated\nor repaired, categorized by cause; (v) number of hazardous leaks either\neliminated or repaired or total number of leaks if all leaks are repaired when\nfound, categorized by material; and\n(vi)\nany additional measures the operator\ndetermines are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the operator's GDPIM\nprogram in controlling each identified threat. (f) Periodic evaluation and improvement. An\noperator must reevaluate threats and risks on its entire pipeline and consider\nthe relevance of threats in one location to other areas. Each operator must\ndetermine the appropriate period for conducting complete program evaluations\nbased on the complexity of its system and changes in factors affecting the risk\nof failure. An operator must conduct a complete program re-evaluation at least\nevery five years. The operator must consider the results of the performance\nmonitoring in these evaluations. (g) Report results. Report, on an annual\nbasis, the four measures listed in subparagraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this\nsection, as part of the annual report required by 49 CFR part\n191.11. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
