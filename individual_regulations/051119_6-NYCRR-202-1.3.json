  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 202-1.3 - Acceptable procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Emission\ntesting, sampling and analytical determinations to ascertain compliance with\nthis Subchapter shall be conducted in accordance with test methods acceptable\nto the department. The Reference Methods contained in 40 CFR part\n51, appendix\nM, 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, 40 CFR part\n61, appendix B, and 40 CFR part\n63, appendix A (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) and all future\ntechnical revisions, additions or corrections made thereto shall be considered\nas acceptable test methods for those sources and contaminants for which they\nare expressly applicable, except where the department has issued a specific\nmethod to be used instead of a Reference Method contained in these Federal\nregulations or where the department determines that one or more alternate\nmethods are also acceptable. The person who owns or operates an air\ncontamination source shall submit the emission test report in triplicate to the\ndepartment within 60 days after the completion of tests. In the event such\nsource owner/operator can demonstrate to the department such time is not\nsufficient, the source owner/operator may submit a request in writing and be\ngranted an extension. Where an opacity emission standard is applicable to the\nsource tested, the emission test report shall include the opacity\nobservation. (b) Alternative\nemission test methods or deviations from acceptable test methods may be\nacceptable to the department if the character of the test site or the emissions\nmakes it impractical to utilize acceptable test methods or where no applicable\ntest method is available. In such cases, the source owner/operator shall secure\nprior written acceptance by the department of any proposed alternative emission\ntest method. Requests for such prior acceptance shall include justification for\nsubstituting the alternative emission test method. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n202-1.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
