  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 591.3 - Project selection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) State land projects which meet the\nminimum eligibility requirements as hereinafter enumerated may be initiated in\nany of the following three ways: (1)\n\nDepartment program staff. Staff designated by the commissioner from various\nprogram areas within the department will, on a continuing basis, identify, categorize and prioritize proposed State land projects under each of the bond\nact categories. (2)\n\nProperty\nowner. Land owners who believe that their property may meet eligibility\nrequirements for State acquisition under the bond act, and who desire to sell\nsuch property or an interest therein, are encouraged to contact the\ndepartment. (3)\n\nPublic\nparticipation. Any person who wishes to participate in the implementation of\nthe bond act may submit recommendations for State land acquisition, preservation or improvement projects to the department. The ultimate selection decision on any State land project\nwill be made by the commissioner, who is charged by law with this\nresponsibility, regardless of the method of project initiation. (b) Only certain State\nland acquisition, preservation and improvement projects can qualify for funding\nunder the bond act. They are referred to as \"forest preserve projects\" and\n\"environmentally sensitive lands projects,\" each of which is more clearly\ndefined in section\n591.2\nof this Part. Of the projects\nwhich qualify, there are some, for various reasons, which will not achieve the\nobjectives of preservation, enhancement, restoration and improvement of the\nquality of the State's environment. In order to meet statutory requirements, as\nwell as these objectives, each State project must meet the minimum eligibility\nrequirements which are enumerated in subdivision (c) of this section for forest\npreserve projects, and in subdivisions (d) through (m) of this section for each\ntype of environmentally sensitive lands project. (c) Forest preserve projects. (1)\n\nThe proposed project must be located\nwithin either the Adirondack or Catskill Park. (2)\n\nThe proposed project must be located\noutside of the boundaries of an incorporated village or city. (3)\n\nThe proposed project must be located\noutside of the Towns of Altona and Dannemora, Clinton County. (d) Aquifer recharge areas. (1)\n\nThe proposed project is part of a local\ngroundwater protection program which includes provision for local participation\nin funding land acquisition and which has been approved by the commissioner, and adopted and being implemented by the appropriate local\ngovernment. (2)\nA water supply\npermit pursuant to title 15 of article 15 of the Environmental Conservation Law\nmust have been applied for. Such permit must be approved by the department for\nthe express purpose of taking the land proposed for acquisition prior to the\nacquisition of the project by the department. (3)\n\nAn agreement between the appropriate\nlocal government and the commissioner must be executed by the local government\nand approved by the commissioner and provide for management by the local\ngovernment of the parcel acquired. (e) Exceptional forest character. (1)\n\nThe proposed project is at least 10 acres\nin size and contains old growth, defined as long-lived native species where the\naverage age of the dominant trees is at least 150 years. Long-lived native\nspecies means any of the following: chestnut oak, swamp white oak, bur oak, chinquapin oak, American basswood, white ash, atlantic white cedar, yellow\nbirch, sweet birch, pignut hickory, bitternut hickory, mockernut hickory, red\nmaple, black cherry, butternut, eastern hemlock, white pine, sugar maple, tulip\npoplar, American sycamore, shagbark hickory, red oak, white oak, beech, red\npine, northern white cedar, black spruce, black walnut, red spruce; or\n(2)\nthe proposed project is at\nleast 25 acres in size and is a natural area defined as a physical and\nbiological forest unit in as near a natural condition as possible which\nexemplifies typical forest vegetation. The unit is maintained in a natural\ncondition by allowing physical and biological processes to operate, usually\nwithout direct human intervention; or\n(3)\nthe proposed project contains forest\nplants or a forest community that is rare or unusual. Rare or unusual is\ndefined as having less than 100 existing sites in New York State. (f) Exceptional scenic beauty: (1)\nthe proposed project exhibits outstanding\narrangement of natural or man-made features (i.e., water features and/or land\nforms and/or vegetation patterns) that provide positive stimulation, hold\ninterest and command attention of the viewing public; or\n(2)\nthe proposed project contributes to the\npublic enjoyment and/or appreciation of any established scenic\nresource. (g) Open\nspace. The proposed project consists of open or natural land in or near a urban\nor suburban area necessary to serve the scenic, recreation or other related\nneeds thereof. (h) Pine barrens: (1)\nthe proposed project is an addition to an\nexisting pine barrens area which is owned by the Federal, State or local\ngovernment, or a qualified not-for-profit conservation organization, and which\nfacilitates the ecologically appropriate management thereof; or\n(2)\nthe proposed project is large enough to\nmaintain itself as a pine barrens ecosystem and to permit effective fire or\nother appropriate management necessary to the maintenance of the\necosystem. (i) Public\naccess. (1)\n\nAccess to public lands: (i) the proposed project would provide a\nparcel of land leading to public land which presently has no existing access\nopen to the public; or\n(ii)\nthe\nproposed project would provide a parcel of land leading to a portion of public\nlands which are presently inaccessible because of physical barriers; or\n(iii)\nthe proposed project would\npermit an environmentally acceptable through route for a foot trail or\nvehicular access trail where the existing trail now ends; or\n(iv)\nthe proposed project would reduce the\nlength of an otherwise circuitous route facilitating public use of existing\npublic lands. (2)\n\nStream\nrights: (i) the proposed project would\nconsolidate or link together existing stream rights; or\n(ii)\nthe proposed project is on a stream\nwhich supports, or is capable of supporting, viable populations of commercial\nor sport fish on a year-round basis; or\n(iii)\nthe proposed project is on a stream\nwhich is subject, or potentially subject, to seasonal \"runs\" of anadromous\ncommercial or sport fish, whether or not it supports residency of such\nfish. (3)\n\nInland\nwaterway access: (i) the proposed project is\nof land which is physically contiguous to the waters of a lake, reservoir, or\nriver segment that is navigable in fact by any vessel, whether or not\nmechanically propelled; and\n(ii)\nthe proposed project is physically and environmentally developable. (4)\n\nTidal waterway access: (i) the proposed project provides public\naccess to a salt water resource or network of salt water resources that lie\nwithin the marine and coastal district as defined in section\n13-0103\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law; and\n(ii)\nthe\nproposed project is physically and environmentally developable.

(2)\n\nTidal: (i) the proposed project is a tidal wetland, with or without associated upland buffer, as defined in article 25 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, located either in the marine and coastal\ndistrict as defined in section\n13-0103\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law or in the Hudson River Valley between the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge and the Federal Dam at Troy; or\n(ii)\nthe proposed project is of inventoried\ntidal wetlands and associated upland buffer. (m) Wildlife habitat. The proposed project\nmust contain the minimum geographic area necessary, together with associated\nbuffer, vital to the threatened or endangered species' continued use. The\nproject shall be either habitat of year-round resident species or important\nseasonal habitat of seasonally resident species, such as breeding habitats, wintering habitats in which a species spends an extended amount of time each\nyear, and major concentration areas of documented traditional and current\nuse.
