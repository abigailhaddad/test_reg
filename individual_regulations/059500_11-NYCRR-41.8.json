This insurer does not coordinate benefits to ensure that the payments receive favorable tax treatment by the Federal government. Accordingly, prior to applying for benefits, you should seek assistance from a qualified tax advisor.\"\n(aa)\n\nPolicies or certificates that are intended to be qualified long-term care insurance contracts for Federal tax purposes shall provide the following protections against unintentional lapse: (1)\n\nNo individual policy or certificate shall be issued until the insurer has received from the applicant either, a written designation of at least one person, in addition to the applicant, who is to receive notice of lapse or termination of the policy or certificate for nonpayment of premium; or a written waiver dated and signed by the applicant electing not to designate additional persons to receive notice. The applicant has the right to designate at least one person who is to receive the notice of termination, in addition to the insured. Designation shall not constitute acceptance of any liability on the third party for services provided to the insured. The form used for the written designation shall provide space clearly designated for listing at least one person. The designation shall include each person's full name and home address. In the case of an applicant who elects not to designate an additional person, the waiver shall state: \"Protection against unintended lapse. I understand that I have the right to designate at least one person other than myself to receive notice of lapse or termination of this long-term care insurance policy for nonpayment of premium. I understand that notice will not be given until thirty (30) days after a premium is due and unpaid. I elect NOT to designate any person to receive such notice.\" The insurer shall notify the insured of the right to change this written designation, no less often than once every two years. (2)\n\nWhen the policyowner or certificateholder pays premium for the policy or certificate through a payroll or pension deduction plan, the requirements contained in paragraph (1) of this subdivision need not be met until 60 days after the policyowner or certificateholder is no longer on such a payment plan.

Notice shall be given by first class United States mail, postage prepaid; and notice may not be given until 30 days after a premium is due and unpaid. Notice shall be deemed to have been given as of five days after the date of mailing. (4)\n\nIn addition to the requirements of Insurance Law section 3203(a)(10), the policy or certificate shall include a provision which provides for reinstatement of coverage, in the event of lapse if the insurer is provided proof of the policyowner's or certificateholder's cognitive impairment or the loss of functional capacity. This option shall be available to the insured if requested within five months after termination and shall allow for the collection of past due premium, where appropriate.
