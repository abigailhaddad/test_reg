  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-4.10 - Inactive or closed accounts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As\ntenants vacate units, it is essential that proper disposition be made of the\nold accounts. Accounts of former tenants with a balance, either debit or\ncredit, shall remain in the tenants ledger. It is recommended that this type of\naccount be kept in the back of the ledger. Accounts of former tenants on which\nthere is no balance shall be filed separately pending the periodic division\naudit. Subsequent to the audit they shall be transferred to a permanent\nalphabetical file. (b) In the case\nof credit balances due vacated tenants with no known forwarding address or\nwhose whereabouts are unknown, although every effort has been made to locate\nthem, such credit balances shall be kept open for one year from the date unit\nwas vacated, the checks returned undelivered being redeposited and credited to\ntenants accounts receivable. At the end of one year, such credit balances shall\nbe transferred by journal entry to account 3590, Miscellaneous Project Income. The transfer entries in the miscellaneous project income account shall be made\nseparately to show the name of each tenant, the tenant's account number, and\nthe amount of the balance transferred. If, after such transfer is made to\n\"Other Income\", a tenant should make a claim for the amount, the payment\ntherefor shall be charged to account 4140, Project Office Expense. A notation\nof payment of each such claim shall be made in the tenant's original ledger\naccount and against the credit item in the miscellaneous project income account\nto preclude the possibility of a duplicate payment of a refund. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-4.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
