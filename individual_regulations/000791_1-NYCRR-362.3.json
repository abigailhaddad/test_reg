  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 362.3 - Types of department actions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As required by SEQR, this department has\nreviewed its statutory authority, regulations, policy, procedures, and the\nvarious types of actions with which it is involved. In the light of such\nreview, the department has determined that its actions (with the exception of\nfuture capital construction projects) fall within the following categories: (1)\nconsumer protection; (2)\neconomic regulation; (3)\nprevention and control of plant and\nanimal diseases, and human diseases which are transmitted or vectored by food\nor animals; and\n(4)\npromotion, and\nmarketing assistance to agriculture. The department finds that all of its\nactions are Type II actions as defined by section 617.12 of Title 6 and do not\nhave a significant effect upon the environment within the meaning of SEQR and\nthe regulations of ENCON adopted pursuant thereto, and therefore do not require\nan EIS. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n362.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
