  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 12-2.4 - Open surface tank operations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Open surface tank operations creating dangerous air contaminants shall\nbe provided with ventilation to control such contaminants. (See Industrial Code\n\nPart [Rule No.] 18.)\n(b) Classes of\noperations. Open surface tank operations are classified into groups in\naccordance with both hazard potential and rate of contaminant release as set\nforth in section 18.14 of Industrial Code Part (Rule No.) 18. (c) Humidity control. When heat is added to\nthe workroom to prevent the condensation of water vapor evaporated from open\ntanks into mist, such additional heat shall be so controlled that it does not\nraise the wet bulb temperature in the lower six feet of the workroom above 80\ndegrees Fahrenheit. (d) Clean-out\ndoors. Tanks or machines used for cleaning by solvents and having a surface\nvapor area of more than two square feet shall be equipped with suitable\nclean-out or sludge doors located near the bottom of each tank or still. Such\ndoors shall be constructed and maintained so that there is no leakage of\nsolvent when closed. (e) Solvent\ntransfer. (1)\n\nTransfer of flammable solvents\nfrom containers shall be by means of a hose or pipe leading to the bottom of\nthe tank being filled. Containers between which the transfer is being made\nshall be electrically bonded and grounded with a resistance of less than 25\nohms. (2)\n\nVolatile solvents shall\nnot be stored or transferred in uncovered vessels. (f) Vapor phase degreasing. (1)\n\nFreeboard. The level of the vapors shall\nbe kept below the top edge of the tank by a distance equal to at least one-half\nthe tank width or 36 inches, whichever is less. (2)\n\nHeating. (i) Gas. Where gas is used as fuel for\nheating, the combustion chamber shall be of tight construction, except for\nnecessary combustion and flue openings. Mechanically ventilated flues shall be\nindependent of the exhaust duct. Natural draft flues shall be provided with\ndraft diverters. All flues shall be constructed of corrosion-resistant\nmaterial. (ii)\n\nElectric. Electric\nheating units shall be constructed of materials resistant to the tank contents\nand shall be constructed and installed so as to prevent hot spots. (3)\n\nThermostatic control. Every\ntank shall be provided with two thermostats, one of which shall be connected to\ncontrol or shut off the source of heat when the contents reach a temperature\nnot higher than 20 degrees Fahrenheit in excess of the boiling point of the\nsolvent in its uncontaminated state and the other of which shall be located\nabove the vapor zone and be adjusted to shut off the source of heat when the\ntemperature in the zone of the thermostat is at the boiling point of the\nsolvent. (4)\n\nCondensers. Tanks\nshall be equipped with condensing or cooling surfaces consisting of pipes, coils, water jackets or any combination thereof located on at least two sides\nin the upper portion of the tank above the solvent liquid level. Water, refrigerant or other cooling media shall be circulated through the condenser\nwhenever the tank is in operation. (g) Operation. (1)\n\nWhere tanks are provided with loading\nhoists, the hoists shall be designed to raise and lower the work at a speed not\ngreater than 11 feet per minute. (2)\n\nAll products after immersion in solvents\nshall be held in the vapor zone of the tank and shall not be withdrawn from the\ntank until the product reaches the vapor temperature as evidenced by the\nstopping of vapor condensation on the product. (3)\n\nLoading racks shall be of metal or\nequally impervious material. (4)\n\nThe horizontal cross section area of product or rack shall not be greater than\ntwo-thirds of the horizontal cross section area of the tank. (h) Welding and open flame work. No work involving welding, open flames or other sources of ignition shall be\ndone at or about any equipment for open surface tank operations unless such\nequipment has first been thoroughly cleaned of all flammable or volatile\nsolvents and their vapors or is protected by distance or by shielding against\naccidental ignition or heating from such work. (i) Special precautions for cyanide. (1)\n\nWhere rinse, acid and cyanide tanks are\nso installed and used that any of them may be contaminated with cyanide or\nacid, such tanks shall be provided with local exhaust ventilation. (2)\n\nCyanide tanks shall not be provided with\ndrains or overflows which will allow the tank contents to mix with liquid\ndrained from other tanks either on the floor or in floor drains unless the\ncyanide drainage has been properly neutralized. (3)\n\nCyanide salts shall be stored in a locked\nenclosure and set above the level of any floor on which acid carboys are\nstored. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n12-2.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
