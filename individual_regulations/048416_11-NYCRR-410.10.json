The certified external appeal agent shall include in such notification: (1)\na request for any additional documentation that may be available to support the appeal; (2)\nthe address to which any required or additional documentation should be sent; (3)\nwhether the appeal is a standard or expedited appeal; and\n(4)\nfor purposes of notifying the insured's health care plan, as applicable, copies of the documents relied upon by the insured's attending physician to establish medical and scientific evidence that the recommended health care service is likely to be more beneficial to the insured than any covered standard health care service or procedure. (b) Certified external appeal agents shall make a final determination on nonexpedited external appeals within 30 days of receiving the request for external appeal from the superintendent, provided that, in the event that the certified external appeal agent requests additional documentation from the insured, the insured's health care plan, the insured's attending physician or health care provider, other than the documentation requested pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, the certified external appeal agent shall have an additional five business days from receipt of the request for external appeal from the superintendent within which to make a final determination. Certified external appeal agents shall notify the superintendent if additional documentation has been requested.

A certified external appeal agent may not reconsider an appeal for which a final determination has been made based upon receipt of additional information subsequent to such final determination. (e) The certified external appeal agent shall forward to the insured's health care plan any documentation received by the certified external appeal agent that is pertinent to an appeal that has been referred to the agent by the superintendent. Any such documentation that, in the opinion of the certified external appeal agent, constitutes a material change from the documentation upon which the utilization review agent based its adverse determination or upon which the health care plan based its denial shall be forwarded immediately, but no later than 24 hours after receipt of such documentation, to the insured's health care plan, with notification that such documentation represents a material change, for consideration pursuant to section\n4914 (b)(1)\nof the Insurance Law and section 4914.2(a) of the Public Health Law. In the event of receipt of such material documentation, for other than expedited appeals, the certified external appeal agent shall not issue a determination for up to three business days or until the health care plan has considered such documentation and amended, reversed or confirmed the adverse determination, whichever is earlier. (f) For each external appeal determination made by a certified external appeal agent, the medical director of the certified external appeal agent shall certify that: (1)\nthe certified external appeal agent and each clinical peer reviewer assigned to review the external appeal followed appropriate procedures as defined in section\n4914\nof the Insurance Law and Public Health Law, this section, and the certified external appeal agent's application and, as applicable, conditions for certification; (2)\nall clinical peer reviewers met the criteria for conducting the external review pursuant to section\n4900 (b)\nof the Insurance Law and section\n4900 (2)\nof the Public Health Law; and\n(3)\nfor each clinical peer reviewer assigned to review the external appeal, a duly signed and notarized attestation which affirms, under penalty of perjury, that no prohibited material affiliation exists with respect to such clinical peer reviewer's participation in the review of the external appeal pursuant to section\n410.6\n(e)-(f) and (h)\nof this Part, is on file with the certified external appeal agent. Such attestation shall be in such form as prescribed by the superintendent and commissioner.

(h) Certified external appeal agents shall enclose a request for payment with the copy of the appeal notification letter sent to the health care plan. (i) Certified external appeal agents shall not be relieved of responsibility for making a determination with respect to an assigned external appeal on the basis that the insured no longer has coverage with the health care plan that denied the health care service(s) that is the subject of the appeal. However, a health care plan will not be required to pay the patient costs of any health service(s) or procedure(s) that is the subject of an external appeal for insureds who no longer have coverage with such health care plan unless, and to the extent that the health care service(s) was provided while the insured had coverage with the health care plan.
