  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 67.1 - Application\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The provisions\nof this Part shall apply to the filing, processing, hearing, consideration and\ndetermination of an application for approval of corporate documents pursuant to\nsection\n104\nof the Labor Law. See Part 65 of this Title for general rules of procedure and practice not\nspecified in this Part. (b) If it\nis the purpose or one of the purposes of a corporation to form an organization\nof wage earners for their mutual betterment, protection and advancement; the\nregulation of hours of labor, working conditions or wages; or the performance, rendition or sale of services as labor consultant, or as an advisor on\nlabor-management relations, arbitrator or negotiator in labor-management\ndisputes; or if the corporate name contains certain words or phrases as set\nforth in section\n404\n(j) of the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law or\nsections\n201\n(b) and\n301\n(a)(6)\nof the Business Corporation Law: the\nboard's approval is required for the filing with the Department of State of the\n\nState of New York of any of the following instruments: (1)\nany certificate of incorporation, certificate of change and amendment, restated certificate of incorporation, certificate of consolidation, certificate of dissolution of a domestic\nnot-for-profit (formerly membership) corporation, or a statement and\ndesignation of a foreign nonprofit corporation for authority to do business in\nthis State, and amendments thereof; (2)\nany certificate of incorporation, certificate of change and amendment, restated certificate of incorporation, certificate of merger or consolidation of a business corporation, or\napplication of a foreign business corporation for authority to do business in\nthis State. Note:The board's jurisdiction is provided for in: Note: 1. Not-for-Profit Corporation Law, section 404(j). Note: 2. Business Corporation Law, sections 201(b), 301(a)(6). (c) Labor Law, section 104 states: \"104. Corporate instruments; inquiry by board. Whenever any\ncorporate instrument is submitted to the board for approval in accordance with\nthe requirements of any statute, the board shall make such inquiry as it may\ndeem advisable, and shall order a hearing, if necessary, in accordance with\nsuch rules as it shall prescribe, to determine whether or not the purposes of\nthe proposed corporation are in all respects consistent with public policy and\nthe Labor Law, and whether the corporate name is in all respects consistent\nwith its purposes and activities or tends to be misleading. Notice of the time\nand place of such hearing shall be given to the applicant and to such other\npersons as the board may determine.\"\nThe board's statutory function is quasi-judicial rather\nthan merely ministerial in nature. In discharging this function, the board\ninvestigates every application to determine whether the aims, structure and\nproposed internal management of the applicant are consistent with the public\npolicy and Labor Law of the State. The phrase, \"consistent with public policy\nand the Labor Law,\" in the above section of the law, denotes a legislative\nmandate to the board to approve incorporation only of those proposed corporate\norganizations whose activities and operations will not adversely affect or\nexert any prejudicial influence upon the State labor policy as expressed in the\n\nState and Federal laws, the decisions of the courts, and official\nadministrative pronouncements. (d) Every corporate document submitted for\napproval is examined by the board's legal staff to determine its legal\nsufficiency. Thereafter, an investigation is made to ascertain if a public\nhearing is necessary. If a public hearing is held, persons and organizations\nwho may be interested in or affected by the granting of an approval are invited\nto submit written comments and to attend the hearing. At the conclusion of the\nhearing, the applicant and objectors, if any, may, at the discretion of the\nhearing officer or the board, be permitted to file briefs. (e) If the board grants approval of the\ndocument, a resolution of approval is appended to the submitted document and\nreturned to the applicant for filing in the Office of the Secretary of State of\nthe State of New York. (f) Board\napproval of documents for the dissolution of such corporations requires proof\nthat dissolution of the corporation is essential to preserve the interests of\nits members and will not be injurious to the public. Such proof might include: evidence establishing that a corporation is inactive and the probability of its\nreactivation is remote; that the purpose or purposes for which the corporation\nwas formed have become frustrated; that the corporate assets are in danger of\nbeing dissipated; that the corporation cannot continue to function because of a\nparalyzing failure of management and it is reasonably inferable that such\ncondition cannot be remedied.
