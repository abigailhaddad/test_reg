  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 400.3 - General provisions applicable to residential and commercial moving expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nApplication for payment of moving expenses shall be made by\nan eligible person in writing to the commissioner upon forms prescribed by him\nand shall be accompanied by such information, evidence and executed vouchers as\nhe may require. Such application shall be submitted to the commissioner through\nthe Office of Real Property, Facilities Development Corporation and payment of\nsuch moving expenses will be made to eligible persons under the circumstances\nand to the extent set forth herein. (a) Any individual, family, business, or farm\noperator is eligible to receive payment for the reasonable expenses of moving\nhis personal property subsequent to the earlier of the following two dates: (1)\nhe is in occupancy at the initiation of\nnegotiations for the acquisition of the real property in whole or in part; or\n(2)\nhe is in occupancy at the\ntime he is given a written notice by the State that it is their intent to\nacquire the property by a given date or he is given notice to vacate the\nproperty by a specific date. (b) Where the acquisition of real property\nused for a business or farm operation which is eligible for a payment under\nsubdivision (a) of this section causes a person to vacate a dwelling from other\nreal property not acquired or move his personal property from other real\nproperty not acquired, the additional expenses of moving such personalty are\neligible for the appropriate moving payments. (c) Moving expenses shall not exceed the cost\nof transportation beyond 50 miles, except in the case of a business or farm\nwhen the State determines that relocation cannot be accomplished within the 50\nmile area; such exceptions may only be allowed to the nearest adequate and\navailable site. (d) The cost of\ninsurance premiums covering loss and damage of personal property while in\nstorage or transit will be eligible for reimbursement; such insurance coverage\nshall not exceed the reasonable replacement value of the personal property. Moving expenses shall not include any direct losses or losses due to\nnegligence. (e) The type of\ninterest acquired does not affect the eligibility of relocation costs for\nreimbursement provided the interest acquired is sufficient to cause\ndisplacement. If, in the opinion of the commissioner, the acquisition of a\nportion of an entire premises or of access thereto renders all or the remainder\nof such premises unsuitable for continued use and occupation or renders it\nwithout suitable access the removal of personal property from the entire\nproperty may be considered eligible for the payment of moving\nexpenses. (f) Moving expenses shall\nnot include the costs of moving, installing or replacing any fixtures or\nequipment considered part of the realty from the acquired property nor will\nreimbursement be made for any cost of construction or improvement to the new\nlocation or for any remodeling, redecorating or reinforcing of the new\nstructure to accommodate the eligible person or his personal property, unless\nrequired by law, or deemed to be in the public interest by the\ncommissioner. (g) Reimbursement for\nelectrical wiring and plumbing charges and communication systems work covers\nonly that work which is directly related to the personal property being\nrelocated. Reimbursement is to exclude any costs of bringing electrical or\nplumbing services to the new site but may, where circumstances warrant and\nprior approval is given, include costs of labor and materials for distributing\nthese services to the personal property relocated. Reimbursement under this\nsubdivision excludes costs of installing basic electrical wiring or plumbing to\na new structure or that normally found and expected in an existing structure\nand is intended to cover only those costs necessary to provide sufficient and\nadequate but not super-adequate utilities to operate the displaced\nbusiness. (h) It is expected that\nin anticipation of moving, the business or farm will reduce their inventories\nof stock or merchandise as much as practicable in order to have the removal\naccomplished in the most businesslike and economical manner. (i) Application for payment of moving\nexpenses must be made within 12 months after vacating of acquired premises or\nsix months after final award determination in a case litigated in the courts of\nthe State, whichever is the later. Such limitation shall include any eligible\nstorage period. (j) In case a\nbuilding or structure acquired by the State is returned to the owners under an\nagreement, an eligible person will be entitled to the moving expenses for any\npersonal effects, furniture and household equipment remaining in the building\nor structure at the time of removal of such building or structure; however, the\ncost of moving the structure is not eligible for moving expenses. The eligible\nperson, at his option, may accept a room count allowance or receive\nreimbursement on the actual cost basis. (k) In the case where the acquisition of real\nproperty causes the displacement of an advertising sign and such sign\nconstitutes the only improvement to the property acquired or where the\nacquisition causes a person to remove his advertising sign from real property\nnot acquired, the owner of the advertising sign is eligible for appropriate\nmoving payments. However, where the advertising sign is owned by and located on\nthe business or farm displaced there will be no separate moving or related\nexpenses considered. (l) Moving\njunkyards and automobile graveyards. The State will pay the cost to put the\njunk or automobile bodies in an acceptable condition for delivery to the\nnearest reasonable salvage collection point, together with the transportation\ncosts from the appropriated property to said salvage collection point. In the\ncase of moving the material from an appropriated junkyard to a substitute\nlocation the State will pay the processing cost to prepare the junk for removal\nby the most economical means. The State will not pay the cost of disassembly\nfor resale of parts. (m) An\nadvertising sign, junkyard or automobile graveyard that is otherwise eligible\nfor moving payments will not be eligible when it is moved to a site in\nviolation of State, Federal or local regulations. (n) An otherwise eligible owner of an\nadvertising sign or a nonprofit business is not entitled to an \"in lieu of\"\nmoving expense payment. (o) If the\nactual costs incurred by the eligible person exceed the departments approved\nlimit of moving expenses, the eligible person may submit to the department a\nfully detailed explanation for the excess costs. The department's approval\nlimit may be adjusted accordingly. (p) The cost of necessary storage for a\nperiod not to exceed six months may be considered as part of moving expenses\nand will be subject to the following provisions: (1)\n\nMoving expenses may include the cost of\nmoving into dead storage at the prevailing rate in a commercial storage\nfacility or warehouse; no payment will be made for storage on premises owned or\noccupied by the eligible person, members of his immediate family, or his legal\nor financial representative. (2)\n\nIf\npersonal property is subsequently sold or delivered from storage to third\nparties, reimbursement for storage or moving out of storage will not be\nallowed. (q) The costs\nof storage or moving out of storage will not be considered in calculating a\nfigure for determining the extent of participation in any other benefits\ndefined herein. (r) Payment of\nmoving expenses is based upon the pre-approval of estimates and bids before\ncommencing the move. All aspects and phases of the move will be considered in\narriving at an approved moving expense. (Such consideration may include, for\nexample, anticipated storage charges, necessary supervision or overtime\npayments when deemed necessary and reasonable by the department.) If, due to\nextraordinary circumstances, a move is completed without the necessary bids or\nwithout the necessary pre-approval or, if the bids, estimates or bills\nsubmitted in support of the moving expenses appear unreasonable, unnecessary or\nnoncompensable, then the eligible person will be required to submit a fully\ndetailed explanation of all costs and upon sufficient written justification for\nfailure to comply with this Part will limit the payment to its determination of\nthat amount which it considers to be actual, reasonable and necessary moving\nexpenses. (s) In the case of a\nhardship where advance payment of moving expenses is requested, the eligible\nperson must submit in advance a written application setting forth the full\nextent and circumstances of the hardship. A written determination will be made\nby the department. If the department determines a hardship exists, an advanced\npayment of reasonable necessary moving expenses may be made. (t) In unusual or hardship situations, when\ndetermined to be in the public interest, the commissioner may authorize a\npayment even though the strict requirements of eligibility specified herein are\nnot met.
