(3)\nA distribution utility shall not be\nobligated to provide service to an applicant for seasonal or short-term service\nwho fails to post a lawfully required deposit. (4)\nA distribution utility shall be obligated\nto provide service to any applicant who meets the requirements of paragraphs\n(1) and (2) of this subdivision within five business days of receipt of a\ncompleted oral or written application for service, or such later time as may be\nspecified by the applicant, except: (i) where\nprevented by labor strikes or precluded by law; (ii)\nwhere precluded by consideration of\npublic safety; (iii)\nwhere the\napplicant fails to pay or agree in writing to pay the material and installation\ncosts relating to line extensions as required by Parts 98 and 230 of this\n\nTitle, or otherwise fails to comply with any applicable requirements of Parts\n99, 100, 103 and 233 of this Title, and the commission's minimum insulation\nstandards for gas-heating customers contained in Op. No. 77- 10 as described in\nsection\n10.3\nof this Title (17 NY PSC 546; 17 NY PSC 861); or\n(iv)\nwhere\nprecluded by physical impediments including: (a) adverse weather conditions; (b) inability to gain access to premises in\nthe possession of the applicant or others; (c) incomplete construction of necessary\nfacilities by the applicant or inspection thereof by the appropriate\nauthorities; or\n(d) incomplete\nconstruction of necessary facilities by the distribution utility. The distribution utility shall make reasonable efforts to\neliminate conditions preventing extension of service and shall pursue\ncompletion of any facilities it must construct with due diligence. (v) An oral application\nfor service shall be deemed completed when an applicant who meets the\nrequirements of paragraphs (1)-(3) of this subdivision provides his or her\nname, address, telephone number and address of prior account (if any) or prior\naccount number (if any). A distribution utility may establish\nnon-discriminatory procedures to require an applicant to provide reasonable\nproof of the applicant's identity. Service may be denied to applicants who fail\nto provide reasonable proof of identity. A distribution utility may require an\napplicant to complete a written application if: (a) there are arrears at the premises to be\nserved and service was terminated, disconnected or suspended for nonpayment or\nis subject to a final notice of termination, disconnection or\nsuspension; (b) there is evidence\nof meter tampering or theft of service; (c) the meter has advanced and there is no\ncustomer of record; or\n(d) the\napplication is made by a third party on behalf of the person(s) who would\nreceive service. A written application may require the submission of\ninformation required in an oral application, and reasonable proof of the\napplicant's responsibility for service at the premises to be supplied. A\ndistribution utility requiring a written application shall so notify an\napplicant as soon as practicable after the request for service is made, and in\nno event more than two business days after such request, and shall state the\nbasis for requiring a written application. A written application containing the\nrequired information shall be deemed completed when received by the\ndistribution utility. Comment:When a written application is permitted, a\ndistribution utility may require the applicant to provide a copy of a lease (if\none exists), deed, bill of sale or other documentation to show the date the\napplicant became responsible for service. A distribution utility must make a\ndiligent effort to notify promptly an applicant who will be required to submit\na written application. If a distribution utility is unable to contact the\napplicant orally, it must, not later than the second business day after the\nrequest for service is received, send a written notice to the applicant. (5)\n\nSubject\nto the requirements of paragraph (4) of this subdivision, whenever a\nresidential customer moves to a different dwelling within the service territory\nof the same distribution utility and for which the distribution utility's\ntariff specifies a residential rate, and requests distribution utility service\nwithin 60 days, he or she shall be eligible to receive service at the different\ndwelling, and such service shall be considered a continuation of service in all\nrespects, with any deferred payment agreement honored, and with all rights; provided, however, that such customer's prior service was not terminated, disconnected or suspended for nonpayment, meter-tampering or theft of\nservices. (6)\nA distribution\nutility shall extend service to an applicant for residential service whose\napplication for service has previously been denied within two business days (or\nsuch later time as may be specified by the applicant) after the following\nevents: (i) elimination of all the conditions\nspecified in paragraphs (2)-(4) of this subdivision which resulted in the\ndenial of service; or\n(ii)\nby\ndirection of the commission or its authorized designee, who may require such\nextension of service to be made within 24 hours. (b) Denial of application for\nservice--notice. (1)\n\nAs used in this\nsubdivision, the terms deny and denial shall mean any determination, by a\nrepresentative of a distribution utility in response to an application for\nservice, that service will not be initiated as requested. An application for\nservice not approved within three business days shall be deemed\ndenied. (2)\n\nNo distribution utility\nshall deny an application for service without sending to the applicant, within\nthree business days of receipt of the application for service, written notice\nwhich: (i) states the reasons for the\ndenial; (ii)\nspecifies precisely\nwhat the applicant must do to qualify for service; and\n(iii)\nadvises the applicant of the right to\nan investigation and review of the denial by the commission or its authorized\ndesignees if the applicant considers the denial to be without justification. The distribution utility shall advise the applicant of the appropriate address\nand telephone number of the commission, including the commission's hotline\nnumber and the times of its availability. (3)\n\nThe notice required by paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision shall be in writing and shall be either served personally upon\nthe applicant or mailed to the applicant at his or her current address unless a\ndifferent address is specified. When the written notice is given by mail, the\ndistribution utility shall make a reasonable effort to provide immediate notice\norally. (4)\n\nEvery distribution\nutility shall maintain, for a period not less than one year, records of oral or\nwritten requests for service that are denied, including the name and address of\nthe applicant, the date of the application and the utility representative(s)\nwho denied it. (c) Penalty. A distribution utility failing to initiate service within the time\nrequired by this section shall forfeit and pay to the applicant the sum of $25\nper day for each day that service is not supplied unless the commission finds\nthat the distribution utility had good cause for not initiating service in the\nrequired time.
