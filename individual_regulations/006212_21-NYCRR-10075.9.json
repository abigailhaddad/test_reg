  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 10075.9 - Discharge monitoring, reporting and inspections\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Control manhole. When required as a\ncondition of a BPDES permit or by the general manager, the owner of any\nproperty serviced by a building service sewer, carrying wastewater shall\ninstall and maintain in proper working order a suitable control manhole or\nother appropriate station together with such flow meters, automatic flow\nproportional sampling equipment and/or automatic analysis and recording\nequipment deemed necessary by the general manager to adequately sample and\nmeasure the waste passing through the control manhole or monitoring station. This control manhole shall be located so as to permit unrestricted access by\nrepresentatives of the authority. (b) Industrial wastewater sampling, analysis, and flow measurements. (1)\n\nEach industrial\nuser, unless specifically relieved of such obligation by the authority, will be\nrequired, as deemed necessary to submit periodic discharge monitoring reports\nto the B.S.A. These reports shall contain measurements of daily flow rates, daily flow volumes, B.O.D. 5, total phosphate and total\nsuspended solids for use in determining the annual industrial wastewater\ntreatment charges and such measurements of other constituents deemed necessary\nby the general manager. All sampling, analysis, and flow measurements of\nindustrial wastewaters shall be performed in conformance with the latest\nedition of the B.S.A. Sampling Measurement and Analytical Guideline Sheet (see\n\nAppendix 52 of this Title) and shall be performed by a laboratory approved by\nthe general manager. In the case of a recalcitrant industry not performing the\nrequired analyses, the B.S.A. may elect to perform these analyses, bill the\ndischarger for all associated costs of these analyses. (2)\n\nFor industrial users on which mass\nlimitations have been imposed, the periodic monitoring reports will be subject\nto the requirements stated above with the additional requirement that the mass\nof substances discharged and limited either by these regulations or by\ncategorical pretreatment standards will be indicated. (3)\n\nAll wastewater analyses shall be\nconducted in conformance with procedures referenced in the latest edition of\nB.S.A.'s Sampling and Measurement and Analytical Guideline Sheet (see Appendix\n52 of this Title). If no appropriate procedure is specified for a particular\nsubstance, other procedures may be used subject to the approval of the general\nmanager. Any independent laboratory or discharger performing these analyses\nshall clearly and concisely report the analytical results, their units of\nmeasurements, the test method for each analysis and, if appropriate, the\nequipment used. (4)\n\nAll users\nmaking periodic measurements may be required to furnish and install at the\ncontrol manhole, or other appropriate location, a calibrated flume, weir, flow\nmeter or similar device approved by the general manager, and suitable to\nmeasure the industrial wastewater flow rate and total volume. A flow\nindicating, recording, and totalizing register may also be required by the\ngeneral manager. In lieu of wastewater flow measurement, the general manager\nmay accept records of water usage and adjust the flow volumes by suitable\nfactors to determine peak and average flow rates for the specific industrial\nwastewater discharge. (5)\n\nThe\nperiodic monitoring reports will contain all the information and data set forth\nin the most recent edition of the B.S.A. Sampling Measurement and Analytical\n\nGuideline Sheet (see Appendix 52 of this Title). The frequency of monitoring\nrequired will be specified either by the general manager or in the appropriate\npretreatment standard. (6)\n\nThe\nperiodic monitoring reports will be signed by an authorized representative of\nthe industrial user. The user will also maintain records of all information\nresulting from monitoring activities required by this section for a period of\nthree years. (7)\n\nThe sampling, analysis and flow measurement procedures equipment and monitoring records shall\nbe subject at any time to inspection by the authority. (c) Inspections. The general manager, other\nB.S.A. representatives, EPA, and/or NYSDEC personnel bearing proper credentials\nand identification shall be permitted to enter upon all premises or properties, including those in contracted service areas, for the purpose of inspection of\nstormwater or pretreatment facilities and monitoring records, flow\nmeasurements, sampling and testing of discharges, review and copying of all\nfile records and data pertaining to wastewater and stormwater discharge\nmonitoring, investigation of suspected or reported violations, and enforcement\nin accordance with the provisions of these regulations. All inspections and\nrelated activities, as described above, will be conducted by the personnel\nidentified in accordance with the provisions of New York law. (d) Access and monitoring of discharges to\nthe MS4. (1)\n\nThe general manager shall be\npermitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to this regulation as often\nas may be necessary to determine compliance with the B.S.A regulations. If a\nuser has security measures that require proper identification and clearance\nbefore entry into its premises, the user shall make the necessary arrangements\nto allow access to the general manager. (2)\n\nFacility operators shall allow the\ngeneral manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of\ninspection, sampling, examination and copying of records as may be required to\nimplement these regulations. (3)\n\nThe B.S.A. shall have the right to set up on any premises or facility subject\nto this regulation such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the general\nmanager to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the premises' or facility's\nstormwater discharge. (4)\n\nThe\nB.S.A. has the right to require the premises or facilities subject to these\nregulations to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary to\ndetermine compliance with these regulations. The premises or facility's\nsampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe\nand proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used\nto measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their\naccuracy. (5)\n\nUnreasonable delays\nin allowing the B.S.A. access to a premises or facility shall be a violation of\nthese regulations. A person who is the operator of a premises or facility\nsubject to this regulation commits an offense if the person denies the B.S.A. reasonable access to the premises or facility for the purpose of conducting any\nactivity authorized or required by these regulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n10075.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
