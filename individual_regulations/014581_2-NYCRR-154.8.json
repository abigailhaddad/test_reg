Tit. 2 § 154.8 - Distributions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A service award\nshall equal a participant's account balance as of the valuation date\nimmediately succeeding application for distribution of the service award plus\nany unscheduled prior service contributions received by the administrator\npursuant to section\n154.7\nof this Part. A service award\nshall be paid in the form of a lump sum distribution or in such other manner\nselected by the participant in his or her application for distribution of the\nservice award as may be permitted by the terms and conditions of the program\ndocument. (b) Except as otherwise\nprovided in this section, a participant shall be entitled to apply for and\nreceive distribution of a service award only when the participant has reached\nentitlement age.

The administrator shall determine whether to approve an\napplication based on the terms of the sponsor's adoption agreement, the records\nmaintained by the administrator and, in the case of disability or death, such\nadditional records or information as the administrator may require. The\nadministrator, in its sole discretion, may require the sponsor, the appropriate\nvolunteer fire company or volunteer fire department or the participant to\nverify or supply any information the administrator deems necessary to determine\nentitlement to distribution of a service award. (d) In the event that a participant becomes\ntotally and permanently disabled as certified by the workers' compensation\nboard or by any other competent authority approved by the administrator, and\nthe disability prevents the participant from pursuing his or her normal\noccupation, the participant shall be entitled to apply for and receive\ndistribution of a service award regardless of whether the participant has\nreached entitlement age or has acquired a nonforfeitable right to a service\naward. If a State-administered defined contribution volunteer firefighter\nservice award program includes an optional additional disability benefit that\nthe sponsor has elected to provide for a participant who becomes disabled\nduring the course of service as an active volunteer firefighter while actively\nengaged in providing a line of duty service, then, in the event that a\nparticipant becomes totally and permanently disabled as a result of such cause\nand such total and permanent disability is certified by the workers'\ncompensation board or by any other competent authority approved by the\nadministrator, the participant shall be entitled to apply for and receive\ndistribution of such optional additional disability benefit in the form of a\nmonthly payment for life in the amount stated in the referendum authorizing\nsuch benefit. (e) In the event of\nthe death of a participant who has acquired a nonforfeitable right to a service\naward and who has not previously received distribution of all or any portion of\na service award, the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the participant\nor, if no beneficiary has been designated, the participant's estate, shall be\nentitled to apply for and receive distribution of the participant's service\naward regardless of whether the participant had reached entitlement age before\ndeath. If a participant dies after receiving distribution of less than the full\namount of the service award, the remaining portion, if any, shall be paid in\naccordance with the distribution option selected by the participant in his or\nher application for distribution of the service award made pursuant to this\nsection. If a State-administered defined contribution volunteer firefighter\nservice award program includes an optional additional death benefit that the\nsponsor has elected to provide for a participant who dies during the course of\nservice as an active volunteer firefighter while actively engaged in providing\na line of duty service, then, in the event that a participant dies as a result\nof such cause, the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the participant\nor, if no beneficiary has been designated, the participant's estate, shall be\nentitled to apply for and receive distribution of such additional optional\ndeath benefit in the amount stated in the referendum authorizing such\nbenefit. (f) In the event that the\nsponsor has elected to pay prior service contributions in installments as\nprovided in section\n154.7\nof this Part and the\nadministrator determines that a participant is eligible for a distribution of a\nservice award prior to the payment of all annual installments of the\nparticipant's prior service contribution, the administrator shall promptly\nnotify the sponsor of the amount of the unscheduled prior service contribution\nwhich must be paid to the administrator.
