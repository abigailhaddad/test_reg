  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 806.27 - Contingent fees in claims and actions for personal injury and wrongful death\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In any claim or\naction for personal injury or wrongful death, other than one alleging medical, dental or podiatric malpractice, whether determined by judgment or settlement, in which the compensation of claimant's or plaintiff's attorney is contingent, that is, dependent in whole or in part upon the amount of the recovery, the\nreceipt, retention or sharing by such attorney, pursuant to agreement or\notherwise, of compensation which is equal to or less than that contained in the\nschedule of fees in subdivision (b) of this section is deemed to be fair and\nreasonable. The receipt, retention or sharing of compensation which is in\nexcess of such schedule of fees shall constitute the exaction of unreasonable\nand unconscionable compensation, unless authorized by a written order of the\ncourt as provided in this section. Compensation of claimant's or plaintiff's\nattorney for services rendered in claims or actions for personal injury\nalleging medical, dental or podiatric malpractice shall be computed pursuant to\nthe fee schedule in Judiciary Law, section 474-a. (b) The following is the schedule of\nreasonable fees referred to in subdivision (a) of this section, either: SCHEDULE A\n(1)\n50 percent on the first $1,000 of the sum\nrecovered; (2)\n40 percent on the\nnext $2,000 of the sum recovered; (3)\n35 percent on the next $22,000 of the sum\nrecovered; (4)\n25 percent on any\namount over $25,000 of the sum recovered; or\nSCHEDULE B\na percentage not exceeding 331/3 percent of the sum\nrecovered, if the initial contractual arrangement between the client and the\nattorney so provides, in which event the procedure provided in this section for\nmaking application for additional compensation because of extraordinary\ncircumstances shall not apply. (c) Such percentage shall be computed by one\nof the following two methods to be selected by the client in the retainer\nagreement or letter of engagement: (1)\non the\nnet sum recovered after deducting from the amount recovered expenses and\ndisbursements for expert testimony and investigative or other services properly\nchargeable to the enforcement of the claim or prosecution of the action; or\n(2)\nin the event that the\nattorney agrees to pay costs and expenses of the action pursuant to Judiciary\n\nLaw section 488(2)(d), on the gross sum recovered before deducting expenses and\ndisbursements. The retainer agreement or letter of engagement shall describe\nthese alternative methods, explain the financial consequences of each, and\nclearly indicate the client's selection. In computing the fee, the costs as\ntaxed, including interest upon a judgment, shall be deemed part of the amount\nrecovered. For the following or similar items there shall be no deduction in\ncomputing such percentages: liens, assignments or claims in favor of hospitals, for medical care and treatment by doctors and nurses, or self insurers or\ninsurance carriers. (d) In the event that claimant's or plaintiff's attorney believes in good faith\nthat Schedule A, of subdivision (b) of this section, because of extraordinary\ncircumstances, will not give him adequate compensation, application for greater\ncompensation may be made upon affidavit with written notice and an opportunity\nto be heard to the client and other persons holding liens or assignments on the\nrecovery. Such application shall be made to the justice of the trial part to\nwhich the action had been sent for trial; or, if it had not been sent to a part\nfor trial, then to the justice presiding at the trial term calendar part of the\ncourt in which the action had been instituted; or, if no action had been\ninstituted, then to a special term of Supreme Court in the judicial district in\nwhich the attorney has an office. Upon such application, the justice, in his\ndiscretion, if extraordinary circumstances are found to be present, and without\nregard to the claimant's or plaintiff's consent, may fix as reasonable\ncompensation for legal services rendered an amount greater than that specified\nin Schedule A, of subdivision (b) of this section; provided, however, that such\ngreater amount shall not exceed the fee fixed pursuant to the contractual\narrangement, if any, between the client and the attorney. If the application be\ngranted, the justice shall make a written order accordingly, briefly stating\nthe reasons for granting the greater compensation; and a copy of such order\nshall be served on all persons entitled to receive notice of the\napplication. (e) Nothing contained\nin this section shall be deemed applicable to the fixing of compensation for\nattorneys representing infants or other persons, where the statutes or rules\nprovide for the fixation of such compensation by the court. (f) Nothing contained in this section shall\nbe deemed applicable to the fixing of compensation of attorneys for services\nrendered in connection with collection of first party benefits as defined in\narticle XVIII of the Insurance Law.
