  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 86-2.8 - Patient days\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A patient day is the unit of measure denoting lodging provided and services rendered to one patient between the census-taking hour on two successive days. (b) In computing patient days, the day of admission shall be counted but not the day of discharge. When a patient is admitted and discharged on the same day, this period shall be counted as one patient day. (c) For reimbursement purposes residential health care facility days shall be determined by using the higher of the minimum utilization factor of 90 percent of certified beds or the actual patient days of care as furnished by the facility. (d) Reserved bed patient days shall be computed separately from patient days. A reserved bed patient day is the unit of measure denoting an overnight stay away from the residential health care facility for which the patient, or patient's third-party payor, provides per diem reimbursement when the patient's absence is due to hospitalization or therapeutic leave. (e) In computing reserved bed patient days, the day of discharge from the residential health care facility shall be counted, but not the day of readmission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n86-2.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
