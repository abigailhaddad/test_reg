The purpose of the pleadings is\nto give the parties and the Division of Tax Appeals fair notice of the matters\nin controversy and the basis for the parties' respective positions. All\npleadings shall be liberally construed so as to do substantial\njustice. (b) Answer. (1)\n\nThe office of counsel shall serve an\nanswer on the petitioner or the petitioner's representative, if any, within 75\ndays from the date the supervising administrative law judge acknowledged\nreceipt of a petition in proper form. Upon written request, the supervising\nadministrative law judge may extend the time to serve an answer to no more than\n90 days. A copy of the answer with proof of service on the petitioner or\npetitioner's representative, if any, shall be filed with the supervising\nadministrative law judge within the same period prescribed for serving the\nanswer. (2)\n\nThe answer as drawn\nshall contain numbered paragraphs corresponding to the petition, and shall\nfully and completely advise the petitioner and the Division of Tax Appeals of\nthe defense. It shall contain: (i) a specific\nadmission or denial of each statement contained in the petition; however, if\nthe Division of Taxation is without knowledge or information sufficient to form\na belief as to the truth of a statement, then the answer shall so state, and\nsuch statements shall have the effect of a denial; (ii)\na statement of any additional facts to\nbe proven by the Division of Taxation either as a defense, or for affirmative\nrelief, or to sustain any issue raised in the petition upon which the Division\nof Taxation has the burden of proof; and\n(iii)\nthe relief sought by the Division of\n\nTaxation. (3)\n\nMaterial\nallegations of fact set forth in the petition which are not expressly admitted\nor denied in the answer shall be deemed to be admitted. (4)\n\nWhere the Division of Taxation fails to\nanswer within the prescribed time all material allegations of fact set forth in\nthe petition shall be deemed to be admitted. (c) Reply. The petitioner may serve a reply\non the office of counsel. A copy of the reply with proof of service on the\noffice of counsel shall be filed with the supervising administrative law judge\nwithin the period prescribed for service of the reply. When a reply has been\nfiled, or after expiration of the 20 days, the controversy shall be deemed to\nbe at issue and will be scheduled for a hearing. (d) Amended pleadings. (1)\n\nGeneral. Either party may amend a\npleading once without leave at any time before the period for responding to it\nexpires, or within 20 days after service of a pleading responding to it. After\nsuch time, a pleading may be amended only by the written consent of the adverse\nparty or by the consent of the supervising administrative law judge or the\nadministrative law judge or presiding officer assigned to the matter. Leave\nshall be freely given upon such terms as may be just, including the granting of\ncontinuances. Except as otherwise ordered by the supervising administrative law\njudge or the administrative law judge or presiding officer assigned to the\ncase, there shall be an answer or reply to an amended pleading if an answer or\nreply is required to the pleading being amended. Service of such answer shall\nbe made within 75 days after service of the amended petition, and service of a\nreply shall be made within 20 days after service of the amended pleading to\nwhich it responds. No amendment shall be allowed under this subdivision after\nthe expiration of the time for filing the petition, if such amendment would\nhave the effect of conferring jurisdiction on the division of tax appeals over\na matter which otherwise would not come within its jurisdiction under the\npetition as then on file. (2)\n\nAmendment to conform to the evidence. (i) Issues tried by consent. When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by\nexpress or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all\nrespects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. The administrative law\njudge or presiding officer, upon motion of any party at any time, may allow\nsuch amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to\nthe evidence and to raise these issues; but failure to amend does not affect\nthe result of the trial of these issues. (ii)\n\nOther evidence. If evidence is objected\nto at the hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the\npleadings, then the administrative law judge or presiding officer may receive\nthe evidence and at any time allow the pleadings to be amended to conform to\nthe proof, and shall do so freely when justice so requires and the objecting\nparty fails to satisfy the administrative law judge or presiding officer that\nthe admission of such evidence would prejudice such party in maintaining such\nparty's position on the merits. (3)\n\nRelation back of amendments. When an\namendment of a pleading is permitted, it shall relate back to the time of\nfiling of that pleading, unless the administrative law judge or presiding\nofficer shall order otherwise either on motion of a party or on his or her own\ninitiative.
