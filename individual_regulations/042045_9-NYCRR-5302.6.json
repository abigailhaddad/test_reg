(b) The total assessment shall be allocated to each gaming facility licensee in\nproportion to the number of gaming positions at each gaming facility compared\nto the total number of gaming positions at all gaming facilities, all as\ndetermined by the commission; provided, however, that the commission may use\nintermediate allocation bases between opened gaming facilities and gaming\nfacilities that have not opened, as the commission may determine. (c) At the conclusion of a State fiscal year, the commission shall determine the actual costs of commercial gaming regulation\nfor such concluded fiscal year, excluding investigatory fees assessed pursuant\nto Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law section 1349.

If the number of gaming\npositions varies throughout the year, the commission may choose one date on\nwhich to measure gaming positions or may, in its sole discretion, determine an\naverage number of gaming positions throughout the year. (d) Regulatory costs of the commercial gaming\nprogram incurred prior to the opening of the first gaming facility shall be\nassessed to each gaming facility licensee in proportion to the number of gaming\npositions projected at each gaming facility.
