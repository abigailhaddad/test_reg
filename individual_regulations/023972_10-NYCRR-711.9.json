Tit. 10 § 711.9 - Waivers and approvals of equivalent or innovative construction standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Nothing in this\n\nChapter shall be construed to effect any waivers of construction standards that\nhad been granted by the commissioner and were in effect immediately prior to\nthe effective date of this section, except for subdivision (d) of this\nsection. (b) Notwithstanding any\nprovision in this Chapter to the contrary, the commissioner may waive\ncompliance with applicable requirements set forth in Parts 712 through 716 of\nthis Title, provided that all of the following conditions are met: (1)\n\nThe licensed operator or proposed\noperator of a health facility submits to the department a written request for a\nwaiver that describes the following: (i) the\nregulatory standards for which the waiver is sought; (ii)\nthe reasons for the request for the\nwaiver; (iii)\na description of the\nproposed alternative to compliance with the regulatory standards for which the\nwaiver is sought; (iv)\na\ndescription of the physical areas that would be affected by the waiver and the\nimpact that the waiver and implementation of an approved alternative would have\non the function and safety of the health facility, if approved; and\n(v) a description of the financial impact of\nthe proposed waiver alternative, if implemented. (2)\n\nThe licensed operator or proposed\noperator of the health facility submits additional documentation as requested\nby the commissioner. (3)\n\nThe\ncommissioner finds: (i) that compliance with\nregulatory provisions for which the waiver is sought is impractical, unduly\nburdensome or would impede the implementation of an improvement in the design, function or construction of the health facility; and\n(ii)\nthe proposed waiver, if granted, and the\napproved alternative, if implemented, would not adversely impact the financial\nviability of the health facility, or cause the health facility to be out of\ncompliance with applicable Federal or local construction or health and safety\nstandards; and\n(iii)\nimplementation\nof the proposed alternative to regulatory compliance would not adversely affect\nthe function of the health facility or the health and safety of care of any of\nits occupants. (c) The commissioner may, upon request from a\nlicensed operator or applicant for construction approval, approve an innovative\ndesign for energy conservation, which may increase initial construction costs, but which will result in major operational savings due to lower energy costs\nduring the lifetime of the facility, may be approved by the\ncommissioner. (d) All waivers or\nequivalencies granted by the commissioner shall be for a period not in excess\nof the duration of the operating certificate of the medical facility for which\nsuch a waiver or equivalency is granted.
