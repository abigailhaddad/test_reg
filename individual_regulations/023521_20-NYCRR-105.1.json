  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 105.1 - Accounting periods\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 605(a)(1)\n\nAbsence of Federal accounting period. A taxpayer who is\nnot required to file a Federal income tax return, but who is required to file a\n\nNew York State personal income tax return, must report on the calendar year\nbasis unless the Department of Taxation and Finance authorizes the use of a\ndifferent taxable period. This rule does not apply, however, in a case where a\ntaxpayer had for a previous year filed a Federal income tax return and such\ntaxpayer's taxable year for Federal income tax purposes for the last such year, in respect of which a Federal income tax return was filed, was other than the\ncalendar year. Thus, where the last Federal income tax return filed by a\ntaxpayer was on the basis of a fiscal year ending June 30th, and such taxpayer\nis not required to file a Federal income tax return for the subsequent taxable\nyear, but is required to file a New York State personal income tax return, such\ntaxpayer's taxable year for New York State personal income tax purposes for\nsuch year and thereafter is a fiscal year ending June 30th. Where a taxpayer\nnot required to file a Federal income tax return is subsequently required to\nfile a Federal income tax return, and the taxable year for Federal income tax\npurposes is different from the taxable year established for New York State\npersonal income tax purposes, such taxpayer's New York State taxable year will\nbe changed to conform to the Federal taxable year. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n105.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
