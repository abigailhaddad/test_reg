Tit. 20 § 360.1 - Payment, delivery and transfer of cash, deposits and open-market securities whose value is not more than $30,000\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nAny\ntrust company, corporation, bank or other institution, or person having in\npossession or under control cash or deposits not exceeding $30,000, which\nbelong to or stand in the name of a decedent dying after June 30, 1978, or\nwhich belong to or stand in the names of such a decedent and one or more other\npersons jointly, may pay the same to or upon the order of the decedent's\nexecutor or administrator, a surviving joint depositor or any other person to\nwhom payment is authorized by law, without the consent of the State Tax\n\nCommission, without notice to the commission, and without retaining any portion\nof such cash or deposits for the payment of estate tax. In the case of a\ndecedent dying before July 1, 1978, payment may be made under the preceding\nsentence, but only if the cash and deposits do not exceed $2,000. Payment of\ncash or deposits in an amount not exceeding $30,000 ($2,000 in the case of\ndecedents dying before July 1, 1978) should not be withheld on account of\nabsence of waivers issued by the State Tax Commission. (2)\n\nAny trust company, corporation, bank or\nother institution, or person having in possession or under control cash or\ndeposits in excess of $30,000, which belong to or stand in the name of a\ndecedent dying after June 30, 1978, or which belong to or stand in the names of\nsuch a decedent and one or more other persons jointly, may pay not more than\n$30,000 thereof in the aggregate to or upon the order of decedent's executor or\nadministrator, a surviving joint depositor or any other person to whom payment\nis authorized by law, without the consent of the State Tax Commission, without\nnotice to the commission, and without retaining any portion of such withdrawal\nfor the payment of estate tax. Before any payment is made, in the case of such\na decedent dying after June 30, 1978, which, together with all other payments\nmade previously or at the same time, would amount to over $30,000, a waiver\nmust be obtained for the total amount on deposit in possession of or under\ncontrol of the payor as of the date of the decedent's death. In the case of a\ndecedent dying before July 1, 1978, payment may be made and waivers are\nrequired under the preceding sentences of this paragraph, but the amount of\n$2,000 shall be substituted for $30,000 wherever appearing in such\nsentences. (b) Any\nperson or corporation having possession or control of stock or other securities\nwhich belong to or stand in the name of a decedent dying after June 30, 1978, or which belong to or stand in the names of such a decedent and one or more\nother persons jointly, if such stock or other securities are customarily bought\nand sold in open markets, and if the market value thereof is not more than\n$30,000, may transfer or deliver the same to or upon the order of decedent's\nexecutor or administrator, a surviving joint stockholder, or any other person\nto whom delivery or transfer is authorized by law, without the consent of the\n\nState Tax Commission, without notice to the commission, and without retaining\nany portion of such stock or securities for the payment of estate tax. In the\ncase of a decedent dying before July 1, 1978, transfer or delivery may be\neffected under the preceding sentence, but only if such securities have a\nmarket value of not more than $2,000. Transfer of securities having a market\nvalue of not more than $30,000 ($2,000 in the case of a decedent dying before\n\nJuly 1, 1978) should not be withheld on account of absence of waivers issued by\nthe State Tax Commission. (c) A\ncorporation or its transfer agent or registrar may make such a transfer of\nstock or other securities issued by itself, the market value of which does not\nexceed $30,000 in the case of a decedent dying after June 30, 1978 ($2,000 in\nthe case of a decedent dying before July 1, 1978), regardless of the total\nvalue of all stock or other securities issued by such corporation in the name\nof the decedent or in the names of the decedent and others jointly, and\nregardless of whether any other transfer of such stock or securities has\npreviously been made. (d) The State\n\nTax Commission may defer the issuance of waivers consenting to the delivery or\ntransfer to the executors, administrators or legal representatives of a\ndecedent or to the survivors when held in the joint names of a decedent and one\nor more persons, or upon their order or request, of securities, deposits or\nother assets belonging to or standing in the name of said decedent or belonging\nto or standing in the joint names of such a decedent and one or more persons, in such amounts or portions as in the judgment of the State Tax Commission may\nbe required to secure the payment of estate tax and interest which may\nthereafter be assessed on account of the delivery or transfer of such\nsecurities, deposits or other assets. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Part, in the case of a decedent dying after September 30, 1983, any cash\nor deposits or any stock or other security customarily bought and sold in open\nmarkets which: (1)\nbelongs to or stands in the\nname of such decedent and such decedent's surviving spouse as tenants by the\nentirety or as joint tenants with right of survivorship (but only if the\ndecedent and the decedent's spouse are the only joint tenants); (2)\nbelongs to or stands in the name of such\ndecedent in trust for the surviving spouse where such surviving spouse is the\nsole beneficiary; or\n(3)\nbelongs to\nor stands in the name of such decedent in an individual retirement account, an\nindividual retirement annuity account, a Keogh account or any other account\nspecified by the commissioner where the surviving spouse is the sole\nbeneficiary may be transferred or delivered to such surviving spouse without\nnotice to, or the written consent or waiver of, the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance and without retaining any portion thereof for the payment of estate tax\nregardless of the value of such cash, deposit, stock or other\nsecurity. (f) Nothing in\nthis Part shall be construed as requiring the consent of the department, notice\nto the department or retention of assets for the payment of estate tax for the\ntransfer of cash, deposits, stock or other securities described in this section\nthat, with respect to any one trust company, corporation, bank, other\ninstitution or person, do not, in the aggregate, exceed the applicable amount\ndescribed in this section.
