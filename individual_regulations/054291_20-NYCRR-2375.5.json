  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2375.5 - Advisory opinions (TSB-As)\n\nState Regulations\n\nAdvisory opinions are authorized by subdivision 24 of section\n171\nof the Tax Law and are addressed in\ndetail in Part 2376 of this Title. Advisory opinions are binding upon the\n\nDivision of Taxation and upon the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance only\nwith respect to the person to whom such an opinion is rendered and only with\nrespect to the set of facts stated in the opinion. The person to whom an\nadvisory opinion is rendered is not bound by that opinion nor may any other\nperson rely upon or be bound by such opinion. However, although advisory\nopinions do not have true precedential value, they are indicative of the\ncommissioner's position concerning the applicability of statutory and\nregulatory provisions to specific sets of facts as of the date the opinion is\nissued or for the specific time period at issue in the\nopinion. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2375.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
