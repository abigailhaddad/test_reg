[*]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, excessive rules and regulations have unduly\nburdened the State's economy and imposed needless costs on the businesses and\ncitizens of this State; and\nWHEREAS, this administration intends to review all proposed\nrules and regulations to ensure that no rule or regulation is more demanding\nthan required to meet legislative goals; NOW THEREFORE, I, George E.

I further direct each department, agency, division, commission, bureau or other entity over which I have executive power to\nevaluate existing and proposed rules or regulations, to identify for\nmodification, rescission or withdrawal those rules or regulations which have\nunduly burdened the economy of the State of New York and caused job losses or\nwhich are more demanding than required to meet legislative goals.
