  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 398-1.1 - Scope and purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, as\nenacted under title XVI of the Social Security Act, provides benefits to aged, blind and disabled individuals and couples based upon uniform eligibility\nstandards and a national base payment level for SSI benefits. Pursuant to title\nXVI of the Social Security Act, SSI is a federally funded program administered\nby the Social Security Administration (SSA). States have the option to provide\nadditional payments to supplement the basic federal SSI payment. New York State\n(NYS) chose to establish such a program of State benefit issuances. NYS\nprovides eligible individuals and couples such State benefit issuances to help\nsupport their current needs. Such benefit issuances are intended to support\ncurrent and ongoing needs and are not intended to otherwise retroactively\nredress any claimed need for support with regard to past periods of SSI\neligibility where such individual or couple is no longer eligible for such\nbenefit issuance. There are two categories of such State benefit issuances: the\n\nState Supplement Program (SSP) benefits, and the State Supplemental Personal\n\nNeeds Allowance (SSPNA). The Commissioner of the NYS Office of Temporary and\n\nDisability Assistance (hereafter referred to as the Office) is responsible for\nthe administration of all State benefits. NYS provides monthly benefits to\nindividuals and couples who are in active receipt of federal SSI benefits as\ndefined in section\n398-2.1\nof this Part and who meet\nall other eligibility criteria to receive current ongoing SSP benefits as of\nthe time that the federal SSA electronic data file containing such individual's\nor couple's relevant SSI eligibility determination is transmitted to NYS via\nthe State Data Exchange (SDX) with federal payment status codes as defined in\nsection\n398-2.1\nof this Part. SSP benefits\nmay not be issued to, or assigned on behalf of, deceased individuals, their\npayees, relatives, heirs, estates or on behalf of any debt, including any debt\nowed to a congregate care facility where such individual may have been provided\ncare, room and board, or any other private or public entities to whom the\ndeceased SSP recipient may owe any debt or legal obligation. Individuals or\ncouples who meet the eligibility criteria for active receipt of SSI benefits as\ndefined in section\n398-2.1\nof this Part, but who\nreside in a residential health care facility regulated pursuant to the\nprovisions of article 28 of the Public Health Law may receive SSPNA.
