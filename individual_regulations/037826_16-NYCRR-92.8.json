Tit. 16 § 92.8 - Determination of meter performance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Meter registration shall be considered indeterminate when there is any doubt as\nto whether the accuracy of the registration can be determined. Meter\nregistration may also be considered indeterminate if two successive readings\ntaken at each load fail to agree within the specified maximum error. (b) A meter shall be reported as damaged when\nit is registering incorrectly due to tampering, incorrect connections, overload\nor damage originating from external sources. (c) A meter shall be reported as not\nregistering if for any reason it is found not registering at both the light\nload and heavy loan test points. (d) Meter accuracy may be specified as that\nwhich is measured at a single test point or as a combined accuracy based on\ntests taken at multiple load points. Only one method of determining performance\nmay be used for any meter type. The appropriate method for each meter type is\nspecified in the Part 92 Operating Manual. (e) Test methods used for determination of\nmeter accuracy as specified in the Part 92 Operating Manual. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
