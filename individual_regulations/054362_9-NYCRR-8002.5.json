  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8002.5 - Rescission\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After an inmate\nhas received a parole release date, situations may arise which would cause the\nboard to reconsider its decision to grant parole release. The process for\nreconsideration of a parole release date shall be governed by the procedure\noutlined in this section. (b) Rescission procedure. (1)\n\nWhenever it shall\ncome to the attention of the senior parole officer or the parole officer in\ncharge of an institutional parole office that there may be a basis for board\nreconsideration of a parole release date, said officer may temporarily suspend\nthe inmate's release date. (2)\n\nEvents which may cause the temporary suspension and rescission of a parole\nrelease date shall include, but not be limited to: (i) significant information which existed, or\nsignificant misbehavior which occurred prior to the rendition of the parole\nrelease decision, where such information was not known by the board; or\n(ii)\ncase developments which\noccur subsequent to the board's rendition of its decision to grant release: (a) significant misbehavior or a major\nviolation of facility rules; (b) escape or absconding or removal from temporary release; (c) substantial change in the inmate's mental\nand/or emotional condition which results in commitment to a psychiatric\ncenter; (d) imposition of an\nadditional definite sentence; (e) imposition of an additional indeterminate sentence or the resentence of the\ninmate on the underlying indictment or superior court information to an\nindeterminate term where the minimum period of imprisonment of such term\nexceeds that of the pre-existing minimum term; and\n(f) substantial change in the inmate's status\nin relation to any of the factors for consideration denoted in Executive Law, section 259-i(2)(c). (3)\n\nSubsequent to the temporary suspension of\nthe inmate's release date, the parole officer shall, as soon as practicable, notify the inmate in writing of the suspension. The parole officer having\ncharge of the inmate shall thereafter commence an investigation into the\ncircumstances surrounding the basis for the temporary suspension, and shall\nprepare a rescission report delineating the results of said investigation. Said\nreport shall be submitted to a member of the board as soon as\npracticable. (4)\n\nUpon review of the\nrescission report, a member of the board shall order: (i) that the inmate be held for a rescission\nhearing; or\n(ii)\nthat the inmate's\nrelease date be reinstated, except that where the board's reinstatement occurs\nsubsequent to the date originally established for release, the board shall\norder that release occur as soon after reinstatement as practicable; or\n(iii)\nfor any case involving the\nimposition of an additional indeterminate sentence or a resentence pursuant to\nclause (2)(ii)(e) of this subdivision, that the release date be rescinded and\nthe inmate scheduled to appear before a panel of the Board of Parole at least\none month prior to the expiration of the new or aggregated minimum period of\nimprisonment as calculated by the inmate records coordinator. Written notice of\na rescission decision rendered pursuant to this paragraph shall be sent to the\ninmate, and shall state the reason for rescission. (5)\n\nWhen a rescission hearing is ordered by\nthe board, the inmate shall be presented with a copy of the rescission report\nand a notice of rescission hearing. The notice of rescission hearing shall be\npresented to the inmate not less than seven days prior to the scheduled date of\nthe rescission hearing and shall inform the inmate of the following: (i) the date and place of hearing; (ii)\nthe specific allegations which will be\nconsidered at the hearing; (iii)\nthe inmate's rights at the final hearing, which include: (a) the right to be represented by\ncounsel; (b) the right to appear\nand speak on his own behalf; to present witnesses and introduce documentary\nevidence; and\n(c) the right to\nconfront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, unless he has been convicted of a\ncrime for which an additional sentence has been imposed or unless a majority of\nthe members of the Board of Parole conducting the hearing find good cause in\nthe record for the nonattendance of a witness. (6)\n\nAn attorney who represents an inmate at a\nrescission hearing shall file a notice of appearance with the parole officer in\ncharge of the institutional parole office where the inmate is\nincarcerated. (c) Rescission hearing schedules. (1)\nA\nrescission hearing shall be scheduled to take place within a reasonable time\nafter the board orders a hearing. The hearing shall be convened at the inmate's\nstate facility of incarceration, and shall be conducted by members of the Board\nof Parole. (2)\n\nAn attorney who has\nfiled a notice of appearance with the parole officer in charge of the\ninstitutional parole office shall be given reasonable notice of the date, time\nand place of the hearing. (3)\n\nAdjournments will not normally be granted. Applications for an adjournment by\neither party shall be made to the board member conducting the hearing. However, an adjournment may be granted by the parole officer in charge of the\ninstitutional parole office in which the hearing is scheduled to be conducted\nin the following instances: (i) the inmate\ncannot appear due to unavoidable circumstances, including incarceration outside\nthe facility in which the hearing is scheduled or physical\nincapacitation; (ii)\nnot less than\nfive days before the scheduled hearing, the inmate and/or attorney makes a\nwritten request for a postponement due to unavailability of\nwitnesses; (iii)\nnot less than five\ndays before the hearing, the attorney makes a written request based on his\nrecent assignment to the case; or\n(iv)\nwitnesses to support the allegation are\nunavailable. No more than one adjournment shall be permitted for this reason. A written notice of the time and date of an adjourned hearing\nshall be provided to the inmate and his attorney. (d) Disposition. (1)\n\nIf a majority of the members of the Board\nof Parole conducting the rescission hearing are satisfied that substantial\nevidence was presented at the hearing to form a basis for rescinding the grant\nof release, they shall so find. In such cases, the majority of the members may: (i) rescind the inmate's release date and set\na new date for further release consideration not more than 24 months from the\ndate of the original release interview; or\n(ii)\nrescind the inmate's original release\ndate and set a new release date. (2)\n\nIf a majority of the members of the board\nconducting the hearing are not satisfied that substantial evidence exists to\nform a basis for rescinding the grant of release, the board shall cancel the\nsuspension and reinstate the inmate's original release date or, if that date\nhas past, release shall occur as soon thereafter as is practicable. (3)\n\nWithin 14 days after the rescission\nhearing, a written statement shall be prepared and sent to the inmate and his\nattorney, indicating the disposition of the proceeding and the reasons\ntherefor.
