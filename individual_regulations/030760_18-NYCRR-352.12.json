  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 352.12 - Income and benefits as related to employment\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn determining initial and continuing eligibility, current employment, past employment, employability and work-related benefits\nshall be fully explored and verified. The applicant or recipient shall be\nrequired to seek and accept employment in which he is able to engage, to\nutilize placement facilities and to make application for work-related\nbenefits. (a) Present employment. (1)\n\nIncome from wages. The employment and\nearnings of an employed applicant or recipient must be verified, including the\nname and address of employer, social security number, work classification, date\nemployment started, amount of gross and net wages, items covered by deductions, exemptions and number of dependents claimed for income tax purposes. (2)\n\nIncome from self-employment or small\nbusiness. The facts and conditions of a business owned or operated by an\napplicant or recipient must be explored and verified insofar as possible, including operating costs, gross sales, net profits, current inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, general financial history, and present\nand future prospects. A careful analysis and appraisal of these facts is\nrequired as a basis for counseling the owner on liquidation or continuance of\nthe business. The social security number must be secured. If the business has\nbeen in existence for three years, the social services district must review the\nbusiness to determine if the business has the potential for future growth. If\nthe social services district determines that the business has no potential for\nfuture growth, and does not produce income at least equal to that which could\nbe expected from employment, the applicant or recipient must be required as a\ncondition of eligibility to liquidate the business. If, after the social\nservices district conducts the review of the business, the district determines\nthat there is potential for growth of the business, the social services\ndistrict may defer the requirement that the applicant or recipient liquidate\nthe business for a period of up to an additional two years. (b) Past employment. An employment\nhistory shall be obtained and verified where practicable for each applicant or\nrecipient with previous work experience, for a period sufficient to determine\nhis presumptive eligibility for work-related benefits, his occupational\nexperience, his work record, and the possibilities for reemployment. The\nemployment history shall include names and addresses of former employers, social security number, dates of employment and the nature of work performed. In the case of recently employed, employable persons the information shall\ninclude the amount of weekly wages and reason for termination of\nemployment. (c) Work-related\nbenefits. (1)\n\nThe agency shall explore\neligibility for work-related benefits, require presumptively eligible persons\nto make application therefor, and verify the receipt of benefits in accordance\nwith the applicable board rules, department regulations, and the procedures and\nforms required by the department or administrative agency for clearance of such\nbenefits. (2)\nOASDI benefits shall\nbe deemed an available resource that must be utilized as a condition of\neligibility, including benefits available for retired workers and the wives of\nretired workers at age 62 and for widows at age 60. Exceptions may be made in\nshort-term cases where need is presumed to continue for not more than three\nmonths. Where need is presumed to be temporary and no referral is made, the\ncase record should clearly state the reason for the decision. (3)\n\nSpecial OASDI age-72 benefits shall be\ndeemed an available resource that must be utilized as a condition of\neligibility, except when a cash assistance applicant and/or recipient would be\ndisadvantaged by receipt of such benefits.
