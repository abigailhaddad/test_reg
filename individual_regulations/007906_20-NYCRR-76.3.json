  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 76.3 - Sales of cigarettes out-of-state\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 471, 471-a, 475 and 476\n(a) The Constitution of the United States\nprohibits any state from imposing a tax which directly burdens or unduly\nimpedes interstate or foreign commerce and from attempting to impose a tax on\nany person, property or privilege which is not within such state's\njurisdiction. While it is axiomatic that New York State is without power to\nimpose the cigarette tax under any such circumstances, a licensed cigarette\nagent may, pursuant to this section, sell cigarettes upon which the tax has not\nbeen prepaid and precollected but which are within this State's taxing\nauthority to out-of-state purchasers without incurring any tax liability\npursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law. (b) When such cigarettes upon which the\ncigarette tax has not been prepaid and precollected are sold for purposes of\nresale or use outside of the State of New York, the licensed cigarette agent\nshall require and receive from the out-of-State purchaser, at the time of each\ndelivery and as proof of the exempt sale, a certificate to the effect that the\ncigarettes (evidenced by an attached detailed invoice or other such document)\nwill be immediately removed from the State to an identified location for such\npurposes and that such cigarettes shall not be returned to the State for sale\nor use herein. The certificate must be signed by the purchaser and must be in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n76.1\n(d) of this Part. (c) No person other\nthan a duly licensed cigarette agent (or its employees) may possess in this\n\nState cigarettes upon which the tax has not been prepaid and precollected for\npurposes of making out-of-state sales where such cigarettes have come within\nthe jurisdiction of New York State for purposes of taxation. An agent must\nreport all sales of cigarettes to out-of-state purchasers in its monthly\ncigarette tax return. (d) See Part\n77 of this Title for refund provisions applicable to out-of-state sales of\ncigarettes upon which the cigarette tax has been paid. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n76.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
