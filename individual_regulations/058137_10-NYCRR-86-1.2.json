Tit. 10 §§ 86-1.2 - Financial and statistical data required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each medical facility shall complete and file with the department and/or its agent annual financial and statistical report forms supplied by the department and/or its agent. Medical facilities certified for title XVIII (Medicare) shall use the same fiscal year for title XIX (Medicaid) and title B (children's bureau programs) as is used for title XVIII. All other medical facilities must report their operations on a calendar-year basis. (b) Financial and statistical reports required by this Subpart shall be submitted to the department and/or its agent no later than five months following the close of the fiscal period. Extensions of time for filing reports may be granted by the commissioner upon application received prior to the due date of the report only in those circumstances where the medical facility establishes, by documentary evidence, that the reports cannot be filed by the due date for reasons beyond the control of the facility. (c) In the event a medical facility fails to file the required financial and statistical reports on or before the due dates, or as the same may be extended pursuant to subdivision (b) or (e) of this section, or fails to comply with the provisions of subdivision (k) of this section, the commissioner shall reduce the current rate paid by State governmental agencies by two percent for a period beginning on the first day of the calendar month following the original due date of the required reports and continuing until the last day of the calendar month in which the required reports are filed. (d) In the event that any information or data which a facility has submitted to the department on required reports, budgets or appeals for rate revisions intended for use in establishing rates is inaccurate or incorrect, whether by reason of subsequent events or otherwise, such facility shall forthwith submit to the department a correction of such information or data which meets the same certification requirements as the document being corrected. (e) If the financial and statistical reports required by this Subpart are determined by the department or its agent to be incomplete, inaccurate or incorrect, the facility will have 30 days from date of receipt of notification to provide the corrected or additional data. Failure to file the corrected or additional data within 30 days, or within such period as extended by the commissioner, will result in application of subdivision (c) of this section. (f) Specific additional data related to the rate setting process may be requested by the commissioner. These data, which may include but are not limited to, those for use in a wage geographic differential survey, a peer grouping data survey, a medical supplies survey, a malpractice insurance survey, a graduate medical education survey and a quarterly utilization survey, must be provided by the medical facility within 30 days from the date of receipt of notification to supply such information. The commissioner must supply to each facility, prior to the start of each rate period, a preliminary listing of the data that will be required. Failure to submit the additional data shall result in application of the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section, unless the medical facility can prove by documentary evidence that the data being requested is not available. (g) General hospitals shall submit to the commissioner at least 120 days prior to the commencement of each revenue cap year, a schedule of anticipated capital-related inpatient expenses for the forthcoming year pursuant to the provisions of section\n86-1.25\nof this Subpart. (h) General hospitals with exempt psychiatric units shall submit hospital data regarding patients in such units as required by the Office of Mental Health (see 14 NYCRR Part\n580\n). (i) Each medical facility shall file with the department a complete copy of the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service Form 990, for that facility. The Form 990 shall be submitted to the department no later than 30 days following the annual filing with the Internal Revenue Service. Failure to submit the Form 990 shall result in application of the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section. (j) Generally accepted accounting principles. The completion of the financial and statistical report forms shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied to the medical facility, unless the reporting instructions authorize specific variation in such principles. (k) Accountant's certification.

The minimum standard for the term independent shall be the standard used by the State Board of Public Accountancy. (l) Certification by operator, officer or official.
