  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 36.1 - Erroneous refund\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For\npurposes of paragraph (5) of subsection (c) of section 1083 and subsection (m)\nof section\n1084\nof the Tax Law, the term erroneous\nrefund means a refund which is issued as a result of an error made by an\nemployee of the Department of Taxation and Finance, including an error made in\nan audit of the return. However, a refund in the amount requested by the\ntaxpayer on the return, including a refund of such amount issued after\nverification of such return for mathematical error by an employee of the\ndepartment, is not an erroneous refund as defined in this subdivision, up to or\nin any part of the amount claimed, since such refund is issued relying entirely\non the claims made therein by the taxpayer. (b) Examples of the application of the\nerroneous refund concept under subdivision (a) of this section include, but are\nnot limited to, the following: Example 1:Taxpayer A claims a New York investment tax\ncredit of $4,500 on A's 1986 New York State corporation tax return. Upon\nprocessing, the investment tax credit claimed is entered on the department's\ncomputer as $5,400 and the department increases the refund requested by A. At a\nlater date, within the statute of limitations pursuant to section\n1083\nof the Tax Law, the department\ndiscovers its error and issues a deficiency for the portion of the refund\nissued in error. Since such portion of the refund previously issued occurred as\na result of an error made by an employee of the department, such portion is an\nerroneous refund and interest will not be imposed on the deficiency pursuant to\nsubsection (m) of section\n1084\nof the Tax Law. Example 2:Taxpayer C files a timely 1986 New York\ncorporation tax return requesting a refund. C receives a refund in the amount\nrequested. Upon audit, within the statute of limitations pursuant to section\n1083\nof the Tax Law, an item claimed on\nsuch return is disallowed and a deficiency for the tax due is issued. Since the\ndepartment relied entirely on the claims made by C on the return in issuing the\nrefund in the amount requested by C, such refund is not an erroneous refund and\ninterest will be computed on the tax due pursuant to subsection (a) of section\n1084\nof the Tax Law.
