  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 990.15 - Testimony of Safety Board and staff\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept as provided in this section, no member of the board\nor its staff shall be compelled or permitted to testify in any litigation\ninvolving any matter which is or was subject to an investigation by the board, either during or subsequent to such investigation, unless the board is a party\nto such litigation. Testimony of members of the board's staff may be available\nfor use in actions or suits for damages arising out of accidents investigated\nby the board, through depositions or written interrogatories only. Depositions\nmay only be taken at the board's main office, unless the board agrees to a\ndeposition at another location. Depositions must be on notice to all parties, and must be at a time convenient to the board. Members of the board's staff may\nbe compelled to submit to a deposition only once in connection with any\naccident investigation, and consequently, when more than one lawsuit arises, it\nshall be the duty of counsel seeking the deposition to ascertain the identity\nof all parties and to notify them to afford them opportunity to participate in\nthe deposition. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n990.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
