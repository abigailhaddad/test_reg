(b) The design and the operation\nof pasteurization equipment and all appurtenances thereto shall comply with the\napplicable specifications and operational procedures set forth in sections 2.45\nthrough\n2.48\nof this Part and set forth in\n\nAppendicies 3-10 to this Part, except with respect to milk, lowfat milk, skim\nmilk, milk products, goat milk, goat milk products, sheep milk, sheep milk\nproducts, frozen desserts and melloream that will be aseptically processed or\nultra-pasteurized, the design and the operation of processing equipment and\nappurtenances thereto shall also comply with Appendix L and Item 16p(c) of the\nPMO. (c) Cream for buttermaking\nshall be pasteurized at a temperature of not less than 165° F and held\ncontinuously in a vat at such temperature for not less than 30 minutes, or at a\ntemperature of not less than 185° F for not less than 15 seconds, or any other\ntemperature and holding time approved by the commissioner that will assure\npasteurization and comparable keeping-quality characteristics. If the vat\nmethod of pasteurization is used, vat covers shall be kept closed during the\nholding and cooling periods. (d) Every person who operates a milk plant at which frozen desserts are\nmanufactured shall ensure that all flavoring agents added to frozen desserts\nafter the frozen desserts have been pasteurized are sterile, aseptically\nprocessed or otherwise treated to a temperature which will render them free of\nall pathogenic bacteria, or alternatively have a water activity (aw) value of\n0.85 or less or have a pH level of 4.6 or less. All flavoring agents shall, insofar as possible, be completely used up during each day's\nmanufacturing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
