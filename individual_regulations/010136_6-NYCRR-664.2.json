Amphibian species are those that are considered obligate\nvernal pool breeders in New York State, including the Spotted Salamander\n('Ambystoma maculatum'), Wood Frog ('Lithobates sylvaticus' or 'Rana\nsylvatica'), Jefferson Salamander ('Ambystoma jeffersonianum'), Blue-Spotted\n\nSalamander ('Ambystoma laterale'), hybrids of Jefferson and Blue-Spotted\n\nSalamander, Eastern Tiger Salamander ('Ambystoma tigrinum'), and Marbled\n\nSalamander ('Ambystoma opacum'). (d) 'Commissioner' means the commissioner of\nthe Department of Environmental Conservation or a duly authorized\nrepresentative. (e) 'Contiguous'\nmeans physically touching or physically connected. (f) 'Critically imperiled' means a wetland\nplant community, plant species, or animal species that because of extreme\nrarity, steep declines in population, or severe threats are at a high risk of\nextirpation in New York State, with generally five or fewer occurrences within\nthe State. (g) 'Delineation' means\nthe precise demarcation of a regulated freshwater wetland boundary. (h) 'Department' means the New York State\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation. (i) 'Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map' or\n'DFIRM' means, for the purposes of this Part, the digital insurance and\nfloodplain management map produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including the 'National Flood Hazard Layer', that identifies, based on detailed\nor approximate analyses, the areas subject to flooding during a 1-percent\nannual chance (100-year) flood event in a community. Flood insurance risk\nzones, which are used to compute actuarial flood insurance rates, also are\nshown on Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps. In areas studied by detailed\nanalyses, the DFIRM shows base flood elevations to reflect the elevations of\nthe 1-percent annual chance flood.

Vernal pools, temporarily hold water during the\nspring, summer, and/or fall, and typically dry up for a period of time during\nthe year. Vernal pools do not support permanent adult fish populations, yet\nthey provide essential habitat for amphibian, invertebrate, and other\nspecies.
