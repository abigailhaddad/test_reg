(c) Procedure. (1)\n\nAn employee may\nrequest an exemption from any requirement to report one or more items of\ninformation that pertain to his or her spouse or unemancipated children by\nfiling a written request with the commission on or before: (i) April 1st of the year in\nwhich such exemption is requested, if he or she is employed by the Unified\n\nCourt System on January 1st, or commences employment from January 2nd through\n\nApril 15th, of that year; or\n(ii)\n15 days from the date that the\nemployee commences employment (which includes a change to a new job title that\nrequires him or her to file) if he or she commences employment with the Unified\n\nCourt System from April 16th through December 31st of the year in which the\nexemption is requested. (2)\n\nThe request for the exemption shall\ninclude: (i) the name, home\naddress, work address, work telephone number, and job title of the employee\nrequesting the exemption; (ii)\nthe specific information the\nspouse or employee objects to reporting on the employee's financial disclosure\nstatement; (iii)\na\nstatement that the employee or his or her spouse objects to reporting the\ninformation on the financial disclosure statement, giving specific reasons and\njustifications therefor; (iv)\na statement in support of the\nemployee's claim that the information that would otherwise be required to be\nreported on the financial disclosure statement will have no material bearing on\nthe discharge of the employee's official duties, giving specific reasons and\njustifications therefor; and\n(v) documentation supporting the\naforesaid statements may be annexed to the request. (3)\n\nThe request for exemption\nmust be signed by the employee requesting the exemption. (d) Commission action. (1)\n\nUpon receipt of a request\nfor an exemption from the requirement to report one or more items of\ninformation which pertain to an employee's spouse or unemancipated children, the commission shall review the material filed to determine whether an\nobjection has been made by the appropriate person to the reporting of the\ninformation, and whether the information for which an exemption is requested\nwill have a material bearing on the discharge of the employee's official\nduties. (2)\n\nIf the\ncommission determines that additional information would be useful, it may\nrequest such information from the employee requesting the exemption. Such\nadditional information must be filed with the commission within the time limit\nset forth in the commission's written request. If the commission has not\nreceived such information within the said time limit, it may render its\ndecision on the information available. The commission, in its discretion, may\nrequest a meeting with the employee, or his or her spouse, to discuss the\nexemption request. (3)\n\nUnless the commission decides by a\nmajority of the total members of the commission without vacancy that the\nemployee or his or her spouse objects to providing the information necessary to\nmake disclosure, and that the information that would otherwise be required to\nbe reported will have no material bearing on the discharge of the employee's\nofficial duties, the commission shall deny the request for exemption. In\napplying the material bearing standard to decide exemption requests, the\ncommission weighs competing public and private interests including the\nfollowing: (i) whether the\ndisclosure of the information could pose a safety threat to the employee or his\nor her family, and the nature of that threat, including its seriousness and\nimminence; (ii)\nwhether the information may relate in a substantial and important way to the\nemployee's official duties; (iii)\nwhether the information could\nreveal or relate to an actual or potential conflict of interest; (iv)\nthe employee's role in\nthe judicial, administrative or managerial process of the Unified Court\n\nSystem; (v) in the\ncase of a spousal/child exemption request, whether the filer has access, or can\nobtain access, to the information required to be reported; (vi)\nwhether the standard is\nbeing applied in the case of a spousal/child exemption request or a deletion\nrequest. The employee's burden is far greater when seeking an exemption\nrequest. The granting of an exemption request means that the relevant\ninformation will not be reported at all on the financial disclosure statement, while the granting of a deletion request means that the information will be\nreported on the financial disclosure statement, but deleted from the copy made\navailable to the public; and\n(vii)\nsuch other factors as may be\nrelevant. If an employee requests a spousal exemption\non the grounds that he or she has no knowledge of his or her spouse's assets or\nincome, and that his or her spouse refuses to supply this information to him or\nher, the employee must so state specifically in the form of an affidavit. The\nemployee must, at a minimum, convince the commission that his or her spouse\nrefuses to provide the information, that he or she has no other source\nregarding this information, and that he or she has made a bona fide attempt to\nobtain, and cannot obtain, the information. Other potentially relevant, but not\nnecessarily controlling, matters include the circumstances of, and reasons for, a spouse's refusal to provide the employee with the relevant information, the\nduration and consistency over time of his or her spouse's refusal to disclose\nsuch information to the employee, and whether the employee and his or her\nspouse file or have filed joint Federal, State or local tax returns. If the\nemployee and his or her spouse have filed a joint tax return, the employee must\nat a minimum report such information as is available from that return. Judiciary Law, section 211(4) and Part 40 of this Title establish a strong\npublic policy favoring disclosure. Thus employees otherwise required to file, who have requested exemptions, must demonstrate that an individual exception to\nthis policy is warranted. (4)\n\nThe commission shall give written\nnotice of its decision to the employee requesting the exemption of its\ndecision. (e) Statement of marital status. If the\nhusband or wife of the employee filing a financial disclosure statement is not\na spouse as hereinbefore defined, the employee shall file with his or her\nfinancial disclosure statement a statement signed by the employee indicating\nthat he or she has been living separate and apart from his or her husband or\nwife for the entire reporting year with the intention of terminating the\nmarriage or remaining permanently separated. This statement shall set forth the\ndate of the separation and the current address of the employee's husband or\nwife. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
