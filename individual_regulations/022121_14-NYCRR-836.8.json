Such notification must be made by telephone or secure electronic method\nimmediately after an incident is discovered. (b) If it appears that a crime may have been\ncommitted against any custodian or service recipient, the provider must\nimmediately make such reports as are necessary to provide notification to the\nappropriate law enforcement agency of the incident. A provider may disclose\nclient-identifying information to the appropriate law enforcement agency only\nwhen such disclosure: (1)\nis directly related\nto a client's commission of a crime on the premises of the program or a threat\nto commit such a crime; and\n(2)\nis\nlimited to the circumstances of the incident, including the status of the\nindividual committing or threatening to commit the crime, and such individual's\nname and address. (c) In\nthe event of a client's death in an inpatient or residential program under any\ncircumstances or within 30 days of such client's discharge, immediate\nnotification must be made to both the VPCR and the Justice Center's Mortality\n\nReview Unit (subject to the provisions of 42 CFR Part\n2\n), the process for which\ncan be found on the Justice Center's website, the local coroner or medical\nexaminer, or any other state or local agency identified under state laws\nrequiring the collection of health or other vital statistics.
