Tit. 9 § 4118.3 - Racing inducements\n\nState Regulations\n\nNo track shall give, promise, loan or offer to any\nhorseman any consideration or thing of value to secure the appearance of a\nhorse or horseman at a track for the purpose of participating in racing\nexcept: (a) purse money distributed\naccording to the posted conditions of a race; (b) round trip transportation of a horse, such horse's regular driver and groom, and one ownership interest to and from a\ntrack for an international championship and a reasonable subsistence allowance\nfor said persons during the period they are restricted from racing at another\ntrack as provided for in section\n4118.9\nof this Part. If such\ntransportation and subsistence allowance are furnished by a track the cost\nthereof may be charged by the track, if the parties so agree, against purse\nwinnings, except from said international championship, to the extent of said\ncost; provided that the track in being reimbursed does not receive more than\none half of each said purse won in other races. However, such cost may not be\ncharged against an owner for failing for good cause to enter or start such\nowner's horse in any race; and\n(c) awards made to drivers of horses breaking or equaling track or world records, or to leading drivers at a race meeting.
