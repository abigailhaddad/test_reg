  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4116.10 - Special equipment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every\nsulky used in a race at a licensed harness racing meeting shall be equipped\nwith such special equipment as the commission shall order. The obtaining and\ninstallation of special equipment are the responsibility of each owner. A\ndriver shall not drive a sulky not equipped with special equipment as so\nordered. Mud fenders must be available and must be used whenever ordered by the\npresiding judge. Every sulky shall be equipped with wheel discs of a type\napproved by the commission, which shall be of a solid color or transparent; no\nstripes or designs upon wheel discs shall be permitted. (b) If a sulky is involved in an accident, the paddock judge will affix a tag to the sulky that says \"Do Not Use.\" An\naccident is any unintended event or occurrence during a race or exercise run\nwhere a sulky is operated in a manner in which it was not designed, including\ncollision with any fixed or moveable object other than brief contact made\nbetween the wheel hubs of sulkies travelling in the same direction, locking of\nwheels with another sulky where a wheel loses contact with the ground, or an\nejection of the driver from the sulky. The owner of the sulky that receives the\n\"Do Not Use\" tag must then have the sulky inspected by its manufacturer or an\nauthorized representative. The \"Do Not Use\" tag may be removed by the\nmanufacturer or authorized representative only after inspecting the sulky and\nmaking any necessary repairs. Only the manufacturer or authorized\nrepresentative is approved to remove the \"Do Not Use\" tag. Documentation\nidentifying the sulky and repairs made must be filed by the trainer with the\npaddock judge prior to its introduction back into use. (c) The owner of a sulky is responsible for\nthe overall integrity and soundness of his or her sulky used during training, qualifying or racing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
