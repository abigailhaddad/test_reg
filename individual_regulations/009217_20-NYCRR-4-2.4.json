  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.4 - Net income from qualified financial instruments for corporations other than non-captive REITs and non-captive RICs\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(5)(a))\n\nThe following rules apply to corporations that are not\nsubject to section\n9-4.3\nof this Subchapter. (a) (1)\nA\nqualified financial instrument means any financial instrument that meets the\nfollowing criteria: (i) the instrument is\ndescribed in one of the specified clauses of section 210-A(5)(a)(2) clause: (A)\n-loans, (B) - Federal, state and municipal debt, (C) - asset backed securities\nand other government agency debt, (D) - corporate bonds, (G) - stock or\npartnership interest, (H) - other financial instruments, or (I) - commodities; and\n(ii)\nthe instrument has been\nmarked to market in the taxable year. (2)\n(i) If\na corporation has marked to market any instrument described in clause (A), (B), (C), (D), or (I) of section 210-A(5)(a)(2), then any other financial instrument\ndescribed in the same clause that has not been marked to market also is a\nqualified financial instrument in the taxable year. Each of these clauses is\none type of financial instrument. (ii)\n\nThe determination of qualified financial\ninstrument is done separately for stocks and partnership interests described in\nsection 210-A(5)(a)(2)(G). Stocks are one type of financial instrument and\npartnership interests are another type of financial instrument. If a\ncorporation has marked to market a stock, then any other stock that has not\nbeen marked to market also is a qualified financial instrument in the taxable\nyear. If a corporation has marked to market a partnership interest, then any\nother partnership interest that has not been marked to market also is a\nqualified financial instrument in the taxable year. (iii)\n\nIf a corporation has marked to market a\nspecific financial instrument described in section 210-A(5)(a)(2)(H), then only\na financial instrument of the same type also is a qualified financial\ninstrument in the taxable year. Therefore, some types of financial instruments\ndescribed in section 210-A(5)(a)(2)(H) may be qualified financial instruments\nwhile other types of financial instruments subject to such clause may be\nnonqualified financial instruments. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, the following financial instruments\nalways will be nonqualified financial instruments: (i) loans secured by real property; (ii)\nloans not secured by real property, if\nthe only loans the corporation has marked to market are loans secured by real\nproperty; (iii)\nstock that is\ninvestment capital; (iv)\nstock that\nis not marked to market and generates other exempt income, with respect to that\nother exempt income; (v) partnership interests that do not meet the definition of security in IRC\nsection 475(c); and\n(vi)\ninstruments the receipts from which are subject to section 210-A(5)(b)(2) and\n(6). (4)\n\nIf a\ncorporation is included in a combined report, the determination of whether a\nfinancial instrument is a qualified financial instrument is made as though all\ncorporations included in the combined report are a single corporation. Thus, if\none corporation in the combined group marks to market a specific type of\nfinancial instrument, then all such financial instruments of that type reported\nby every member of the combined group are considered qualified financial\ninstruments. (5)\n\nIf a corporation\nis a partner in a partnership and is computing its tax with respect to its\ninterest in the partnership using the aggregate method as described in section\n9-2.3\nof this Subchapter, and the\npartnership marks to market a type of financial instrument, the corporation is\ndeemed to have marked to market that type of financial instrument for purposes\nof determining if that type of financial instrument is a qualified financial\ninstrument. (b) Except\nas provided in subdivision (c) of this section, the amount of receipts, net\nincome (not less than zero) and net gains (not less than zero) from qualified\nfinancial instruments included in New York receipts or everywhere receipts is\ndetermined using the sourcing method contained in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and as\nfurther described in this Subpart. (c) (1)\nA\ntaxpayer, or the designated agent in the case of a combined report, may elect\nthe fixed percentage method to include 8% of net income from qualified\nfinancial instruments in New York receipts and 100% of all net income from\nqualified financial instruments in everywhere receipts (whether or not such net\nincome would otherwise be included in the New York receipts or everywhere\nreceipts pursuant to the provisions of section 210-A(5)(a)(2). Net income from\nqualified financial instruments is the sum of: (i) net gains (not less than zero) from each\ntype of qualified financial instrument that would be subject to the same\nsourcing method in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and this Subchapter if not for the\nfixed percentage method; (ii)\nmarked to market net gains (not less than zero) from each type of qualified\nfinancial instrument that would be subject to the same sourcing method in\nsection 210-A(5)(a)(2) and this Subchapter if not for the fixed percentage\nmethod election; (iii)\nnet income\n(not less than zero) from each type of qualified financial instrument that\nwould be subject to the same sourcing method in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and this\n\nSubchapter if not for the fixed percentage method; and\n(iv)\nreceipts from each type of qualified\nfinancial instrument. (2)\n\nThe fixed percentage method election must\nbe made annually and may only be made on an original, timely filed report, determined with regard to extensions of time for filing. Any fixed percentage\nmethod election made on a report that is filed late will be invalid and\nineffective. (3)\n(i) Once the fixed percentage method election\nhas been made in the manner required in paragraph (2) of this subdivision for a\ntaxable year, it is binding on the taxpayer and the Department for that taxable\nyear and cannot be revoked or overridden for that taxable year. (ii)\n\nIn the case of a combined report, the\nfixed percentage method election must be made by the designated agent. It is\nbinding on all members of a combined group and the Department for that taxable\nyear and cannot be revoked or overridden for that taxable year. (4)\n\nIf the fixed percentage\nelection has been made, other exempt income, as defined in section 208(6-a) and\nsection\n3-4.6\nof this Subchapter, generated by a stock that is marked to market will be re-classified as business\nincome and will be included in New York and everywhere receipts as provided in\nthis subdivision. (5)\nA partnership\ncannot make the fixed percentage method election. (d) In the case of a combined report, net\nincome from qualified financial instruments included in the combined group's\n\nNew York receipts and everywhere receipts is the sum of: (i) net gains (not less than zero) from each\ntype of qualified financial instrument that would be subject to the same\nsourcing method in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and this Subchapter if not for the\nfixed percentage method for all members of the combined group; (ii)\nmarked to market net gains (not less\nthan zero) from each type of qualified financial instrument that would be\nsubject to the same sourcing method in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and this\n\nSubchapter if not for the fixed percentage method election for all members of\nthe combined group; (iii)\nnet\nincome (not less than zero) from each type of qualified financial instrument\nthat would be subject to the same sourcing method in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and\nthis Subchapter if not for the fixed percentage method for all members of the\ncombined group; and\n(iv)\nreceipts\nfrom each type of qualified financial instrument for all members of the\ncombined group. (e) Examples. For purposes of the following examples, it is assumed\nthat the corporations do not have investment capital or other exempt income\ngenerated by stock that is not marked to market. Example 1: Corporation X, a dealer in securities, elects\nto use the fixed percentage method in the manner required by subdivision (c) of\nthis section to determine the amount of its net income (not less than zero)\nfrom qualified financial instruments to include in its New York receipts or\neverywhere receipts. It owns and marks to market an unsecured loan. However, Corporation X was not required, under IRC section 475, to mark to market the\nloan, because the loan was acquired by Corporation X in the ordinary course of\nits business and is not being held for sale by Corporation X. Since the loan\ncomes within this exception to the general rule that requires dealers in\n\nSecurities to use the mark to market accounting method for such securities, the\nloan will be deemed to not to have been marked to market for purposes of\n\nCorporation X's election to use the fixed percentage method. The loan will be\ndeemed not to have been marked to market even if Corporation X fails to\nidentify the loan as meeting the exception to the general rule. Also, since the\nloan is deemed to not have been marked to market, as that term is defined in\nthese regulations, no other loan that has not been marked to market by\n\nCorporation X will be a qualified financial instrument in the taxable year. These unsecured loans are nonqualified financial instruments. The amount of any\nreceipts and net gains from these assets that are included in New York or\neverywhere receipts is determined using the sourcing rule in section\n210-A(5)(a)(2)(A) and section\n4-2.5\nof this Subpart. Example 2: Corporation X owns and marks to market\nunsecured loan A, corporate bond B, and stock C. In addition, it owns unsecured\nloan D, unsecured loan E, corporate bond F, corporate bond G, stock H, loan I\nsecured by real property, and loan J secured by real property, but does not\nmark to market these instruments. Corporation X elects to use the fixed\npercentage method in the manner required by subdivision (c) of this section to\ndetermine the amount of net income (not less than zero) from qualified\nfinancial instruments included in New York receipts or everywhere\nreceipts. The following instruments are considered qualified\nfinancial instruments: unsecured loans A, D and E; corporate bonds B, F, and G; and stocks C and H. The amount of net income (not less than zero) from\nqualified financial instruments included in New York receipts or everywhere\nreceipts is determined using the rules for the fixed percentage method. Loans I\nand J secured by real property are nonqualified financial instruments. Therefore, the amount of receipts and net gains (not less than zero) from these\ninstruments included in Corporation X's New York receipts or everywhere\nreceipts is determined using the sourcing method in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and\nthis Subpart. Example 3: Corporations Y and Z are properly included in\na combined report. Corporation Y owns and marks to market loans secured by\nreal property, corporate bonds, and interests in publicly traded partnerships. Corporation Z owns unsecured personal loans, stocks, and corporate bonds, but\ndoes not mark to market these financial instruments. Corporation Y, the\ndesignated agent, elects to use the fixed percentage method in the manner\nrequired by subdivision (c) of this section to determine the amount of the\ncombined group's net income (not less than zero) from qualified financial\ninstruments to include in the combined group's New York receipts or everywhere\nreceipts. The following instruments are qualified financial instruments in the\ncombined report of Corporations Y and Z: Corporation Y's corporate bonds and\ninterests in publicly traded partnerships and Corporation Z's corporate bonds. The amount of receipts, net gains (not less than zero), and net income (not\nless than zero) from these instruments included in the combined group's New\n\nYork receipts or everywhere receipts is determined using the rules for the\nfixed percentage method. Corporation Y's loans secured by real property are\nalways considered nonqualified financial instruments. In addition, Corporation\nZ's unsecured loans are nonqualified financial instruments because the only\nloans that are marked to market by either corporation are loans secured by real\nproperty and Corporation Z's stocks are nonqualified financial instruments\nbecause neither corporation marked to market stocks. Therefore, the amount of\nsuch receipts and net gains (not less than zero) from Corporation Y's loans\nsecured by real property and Corporation Z's unsecured loans included in the\ncombined group's New York receipts or everywhere receipts is determined using\nthe sourcing method outlined in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and this Subpart. Example 4: Corporation X elects to use the fixed\npercentage method in the manner required by paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nthis section to determine the amount of its net income (not less than zero)\nfrom qualified financial instruments to include in its New York receipts or\neverywhere receipts. It has $1,000 in dividends from Stock A, ($200) loss from\nthe sale of Stock B, $750 gain from the sale of corporate bond C that was sold\nthrough a licensed exchange, $25,000 gain from the sale of corporate bond D\nthat was not sold through a registered securities broker or dealer or through a\nlicensed exchange, $10,000 of marked to market gains from stock, and ($2,500)\nmarked to market losses from stock. Corporation X marks to market its stocks\nand bonds. Therefore, stocks and bonds constitute qualified financial\ninstruments. Corporation X has $34,250 of net income (not less than\nzero) from qualified financial instruments included in everywhere receipts\nbroken down as follows: * $1,000 of dividends from stock; * $0 of gains from sales of stock (as the loss is limited\nto zero); * $750 of gains from sales of bonds sold through a\nlicensed exchange or registered securities broker or dealer; * $25,000 of gains from sales of bonds not sold through a\nlicensed exchange or registered securities broker or dealer; and\n* $7,500 of marked to market net gains from stock\n($10,000 minus $2,500). Corporation X includes $2,740 (8% multiplied by $34,250)\nfrom qualified financial instruments in its New York receipts. Since\n\nCorporation X only has net income (not less than zero) from qualified financial\ninstruments, the result is a BAF of 0.080000. Example 5: Corporations R and S are properly included in\na combined report, with Corporation R identified as the designated agent. Corporation R elects to use the fixed percentage method in the manner required\nby subdivision (c) of this section to determine the amount of the combined\ngroup's net income (not less than zero) from qualified financial instruments to\ninclude in New York receipts and everywhere receipts. Corporation R owns and marks to market stock A, stock B, bond D issued by State D, and unsecured loan H. Corporation S owns stock C, treasury bill E, bond F issued by New York State, and unsecured loan G, but\ndoes not mark to market these instruments. Although Corporation S does not mark\nto market its stock, government issued debt, and unsecured loan, these\ninstruments still are qualified financial instruments because the determination\nis done as though all the corporations properly included in the combined report\nare a single corporation. In addition, corporation R owns loan I secured by real\nproperty in State Y and Corporation S owns loan J secured by real property in\n\nNew York and an interest in widely held partnership K. Since Corporation S does\nnot mark to market its interest in widely held partnership K and Corporation R\ndoes not own and mark to market any interests in publicly traded or widely held\npartnerships, the interest in partnership K is a nonqualified financial\ninstrument. The income, gains, or losses from qualified financial\ninstruments for Corporations R and S is broken down as follows: * $200 of dividends from stock A; * $750 of dividends from stock B; * ($300) loss from the sale of stock C; * ($500) loss from the sale of State D bond; * $700 gain from the sale of State Q bond; * $150 of interest from treasury bill E; * $100 gain from the sale of New York State bond\nF; * $600 of interest from unsecured loan G; * $1,000 gain from the sale of unsecured loan H; and\n* $400 of marked to market net gains from stock. The combined group includes $3,400 of net income (not\nless than zero) from such qualified financial instruments in everywhere\nreceipts broken down as follows: * $950 of dividends from stock; * $0 of gains from sales of stock (as the loss is limited\nto zero); * $200 of gains from sales of other state bonds (100% of\nthe net gain is included when the fixed percentage election is made, as opposed\nto 50% of the net gain under the sourcing method in section 210-A[B]); * $150 of interest from treasury bills; * $100 of gains from sales of New York State\nbonds; * $600 of interest from unsecured loans; * $1,000 of gain from unsecured loans; and\n* $400 of marked to market net gains from stock. The combined group includes $272 ($3,400 multiplied by 8\npercent) of net income from qualified financial instruments in the combined\ngroup's New York receipts. The amount of income, gains, and losses from nonqualified\nfinancial instruments for Corporations R and S is: * $300 gain from the sale of loan I secured by real\nproperty in State Y ($0 is included in the combined group's New York receipts\nand $300 is included in the combined group's everywhere receipts as the real\nproperty is not located in New York State); * $250 gain from the sale of loan J secured by real\nproperty in New York ($250 is included in both the combined group's New York\nreceipts and everywhere receipts as the real property is located in New York\n\nState); * $400 gain from the sale of widely held partnership K\ndomiciled in New York ($0 is included in both the combined group's New York\nreceipts and everywhere receipts as these gains are excluded from the BAF); and\n* $200 of marked to market net gains from loans secured\nby real property ($91 is included in the combined group's New York receipts, determined by multiplying the $200 of marked to market net gains by the ratio\nof net gains from actual sales of loans secured by real property located in New\n\nYork to net gains from actual sales of all loans secured by real property. $200\nis included in the combined group's everywhere receipts). The combined group includes $341 of income and net gains\nfrom nonqualified financial instruments in its New York receipts and $750 of\nincome and net gains from nonqualified financial instruments in its everywhere\nreceipts. The combined group has a total of $613 of New York\nreceipts ($272 from qualified financial instruments and $341 from nonqualified\nfinancial instruments) and $4,150 of everywhere receipts ($3,400 from qualified\nfinancial instruments and $750 from nonqualified financial instruments). The\nresult is the combined group's BAF is 0.147711. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
