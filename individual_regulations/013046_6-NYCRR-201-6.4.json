  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 201-6.4 - Standard permit requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'General conditions'. With the exception of subdivision (f) of this section the\nprovisions contained in this Subpart are considered standard solely for the\n\nFederal portion of the title V facility permit. The operational flexibility\nprovisions under subdivision (f) of this section shall be available under both\n\nState and Federal portions of the title V facility permit. Each title V\nfacility permit issued under this Part shall include the following standard\nprovisions: (1)\n\nAll Federal emission\nlimitations and standards, including those operational requirements and\nlimitations that assure compliance with all applicable requirements at the time\nof permit issuance. (i) The origin of and\nauthority for each term or condition, and any difference in form as compared to\nthe applicable requirement upon which the term or condition is based. (ii)\n\nAny permit containing the department's\ndetermination that an alternative emission limit constitutes compliance with a\nregulation in the State implementation plan shall contain provisions to ensure\nthat the resulting emission limit has been demonstrated to be quantifiable, accountable, enforceable, and based on replicable procedures. The department's\ndetermination that an emission source is eligible for an alternative emission\nlimit can be made in the permit issuance, renewal or significant modification\nprocess. Permits may only include alternative emission limits if provided for\nin the State implementation plan and if the alternative emission limit is\ndetermined by the department to be equivalent to the limit in the State\nimplementation plan. (iii)\n\nIf an\nexisting facility has installed best available control technology (as defined\nin section 169 of the act), or technology required to meet a lowest achievable\nemission rate (as defined in section 171 of the act), prior to the promulgation\nof an applicable MACT or GACT standard to such stationary source, per section\n112(d) and (j) of the act, for the same hazardous air pollutant (or stream of\nhazardous air pollutants) it shall not be required to comply with such standard\nuntil the date five years after the date on which installation or reduction has\nbeen achieved, as determined by the department. (2)\n\nThe permittee must comply with all\nconditions of the title V facility permit. Any permit non-compliance\nconstitutes a violation of the act and is grounds for enforcement action; for\npermit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or for denial\nof a permit renewal application. (3)\n\nThe permit may be modified, revoked, suspended, reopened and reissued, or terminate d f or c au s e. The filing of a\nrequest by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or of a notification of planned changes or anticipated\nnoncompliance does not stay any permit condition. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator shall furnish to\nthe department, within a reasonable time, any information that the department\nmay request in writing to determine whether cause exists for modifying, rev o\nking and reissuing, or terminating the permit or to determine compliance with\nthe permit. Upon request, the permittee shall also furnish to the department\ncopies of records required to be kept by the permit or, f or information\nclaimed to be confidential, the permittee may furnish such records directly to\nthe administrator along with a claim of confidentiality, if the administrator\ninitiated the request for information or otherwise has need of it. (5)\n\nIt is not a defense for an owner or\noperator in an enforcement action to claim that it would have been necessary to\nhalt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the\nconditions of this permit. (6)\n\nThe\npermit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive\nprivilege. (7)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of a facility shall pay fees to the department consistent with the fee\nschedule authorized by Subpart 482-2 of this Title. (8)\n\nThe department or an authorized\nrepresentative shall be allowed upon presentation of credentials and other\ndocuments as may be required by law to: (i) enter upon the permittee's premises where a facility subject to the permitting\nrequirements of this Subpart is located or emissions-related activity is\nconducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of the\npermit; (ii)\nhave access to and\ncopy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions\nof the permit; (iii)\ninspect at\nreasonable times any emission sources, equipment (including monitoring and air\npollution control equipment), practices, and operations regulated or required\nunder the permit; and\n(iv)\nsample\nor monitor at reasonable times substances or parameters for the purpose of\nassuring compliance with the permit or applicable requirements. (9)\nA severability clause to\ninsure the continued validity of the remaining various permit requirements in\nthe event of a challenge to any portions of the permit. (b) 'Permit conditions for monitoring'. Each\ntitle V facility permit issued under this Part shall include the following\nprovisions pertaining to monitoring: (1)\nall\nemissions monitoring and analysis procedures or test methods required under the\napplicable requirements, including any procedures and methods for compliance\nassurance monitoring as required by the act shall be specified in the\npermit; (2)\nwhere the applicable\nrequirement does not require periodic testing or instrumental or\nnon-instrumental monitoring (which may consist of recordkeeping designed to\nserve as monitoring), the permit shall specify the periodic monitoring\nsufficient to yield reliable data from the relevant time periods that are\nrepresentative of the major facility's compliance with the permit. Such\nmonitoring requirements shall assure use of terms, test methods, units, averaging periods, and other statistical conventions consistent with the\napplicable requirements; and\n(3)\nas\nnecessary, requirements concerning the use, maintenance, and installation of\nmonitoring equipment or methods. (c) 'Permit conditions for recordkeeping and\nreporting of compliance monitoring'. (1)\n\nThe\nfollowing information must be included in records and reports: (i) the date, place as defined in the permit, and time of any required sampling or measurements; (ii)\nthe date(s) any required analyses were\nperformed; (iii)\nthe company or\nentity that performed any required analyses; (iv)\nthe analytical techniques or methods\nused including quality assurance and quality control procedures if\nrequired; (v) the results of such\nanalyses including quality assurance data where required; (vi)\nthe operating conditions as existing at\nthe time of any required sampling or measurement; (vii)\nany deviation from permit requirements\nmust be clearly identified; and\n(viii)\nreports must be certified by a\nresponsible official, consistent with section\n201-6.2\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nRecords of all monitoring data\nand supporting information must be retained for a period of at least five years\nfrom the date of the monitoring, sampling, measurement, report, or application. Support information includes all calibration and maintenance records and all\noriginal strip-chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, all\nquality assurance information and copies of all reports required by the\npermit. (3)\n\nThe permit shall\nincorporate all applicable Federal reporting requirements which must include\nthe following: (i) electronic submittal of\nreports of any required monitoring in a format acceptable to the department at\nleast every six months; and\n(ii)\nnotification and reporting of permit deviations and incidences of noncompliance\nstating the probable cause of such deviations, and any corrective actions or\npreventive measures taken. If the permittee seeks to have a violation excused\nas provided in section\n201-1.4\nof this Part, the permittee\nshall report such violations as required under section 201-1. 4(c) of this\n\nPart. In order to have a violation of a Federal regulation (such as a new\nsource performance standard or national emissions standard for hazardous air\npollutants) excused, the specific Federal regulation must provide for an\naffirmative defense during start- up, shutdowns, or malf unctions. All other\npermit deviations shall only be reported as required under subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph, unless the department specifies a different reporting\nrequirement within the permit. (d) 'Compliance schedules'. Each title V\nfacility permit issued shall contain the following provisions for compliance: (1)\n\nThe permit shall include a provision\nrequiring compliance with the schedule proposed pursuant to section\n201-6.2\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nWhere any performance or emission\nstandard or other requirement is established for a facility prior to the\nissuance of a permit, the permit may contain a compliance schedule requiring\nthe facility to achieve compliance as soon as practicable but not later than\nthe time required by the act or an applicable requirement. (3)\n\nAny document (including reports) required\nby a title V permit shall contain a certification by a responsible official as\nset forth in section\n201-6.2\nof this Subpart that based\non information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the statements and\ninformation in the document are true, accurate and complete. (4)\n\nProgress reports consistent with an\napplicable schedule of compliance and are to be submitted at least\nsemiannually, or at a more frequent period if specified in the applicable\nrequirement or by the department. Such progress reports shall contain the\nfollowing: (i) dates for achieving the\nactivities, milestones, or compliance required in the schedule of compliance, and dates when such activities, milestones or compliance were achieved; and\n(ii)\nan explanation of why any\ndates in the schedule of compliance were not or will not be met, and any\npreventive or corrective measures adopted. (e) 'Compliance certification'. Requirements\nfor compliance certification with terms and conditions contained in the permit, including emission limitations, standards, or work practices. Permits shall\ninclude each of the following: (1)\nthe\nfrequency, not less than annually or more frequent periods as specified in the\napplicable requirement or by the department, of the electronic submissions of\ncompliance certifications; (2)\na\nmeans for assessing or monitoring the compliance of the facility with its\nemission limitations, standards, and work practices; (3)\na requirement that the compliance\ncertification include the following: (i) the\nidentification of each term or condition of the permit that is the basis of the\ncertification; (ii)\nthe compliance\nstatus; (iii)\nwhether compliance\nwas continuous or intermittent; (iv)\nthe method(s) used for determining the\ncompliance status of the facility, currently and over the reporting period\nconsistent with subdivision (b) of this section; (v) such other facts as the department shall\nrequire to determine the compliance status of the facility; and\n(vi)\nall compliance certifications shall be\nsubmitted to the department and to the administrator an d shall contain such\nother provisions as the department may require to ensure compliance with all\napplicable requirements. (f) 'Operational Flexibility'. Each Title V\npermit shall contain a provision stating that no permit modifications will be\nrequired for changes that are provided for in the permit. Such changes may be\nmade without a permit modification if the changes are not modifications under\nany provision of Title I of the Act and do not exceed, or cause the facility to\nexceed, an emissions cap or limitation in the permit. Any compliance\ncertifications, record keeping, or reporting required by the Title V facility\npermit must incorporate and consider any approved changes made pursuant to this\n\nSubdivision. (1)\n\nAlternate operating\nscenarios. The owner or operator of a major facility may apply f or a range of\nconditions to allow for the flexibility to operate under more than one\noperating scenario. The facility owner or operator shall identify each proposed\nalternate operating scenario in the Title V facility permit application, as\ndescribed in Subpart 201-6.2 of this Part. Each proposed alternate operating\nscenario shall be described in sufficient detail to allow the department to\nassess the control requirements, determine compliance with applicable\nrequirements, and maintain the department's source inventory. Each approved\nalternate operating scenario shall be included in the Title V facility permit. Upon issuance of the permit, operation under each proposed alternate operating\nscenario is authorized without a permit modification. The facility owner or\noperator must record the duration of operation under each operating scenario in\na log at the facility and note any changes from one operating scenario to\nanother. Operational records kept pursuant to this paragraph shall be\nmaintained at the facility for a period of at least five years. (2)\n'Protocol'. (i) The owner or operator of a major facility\nmay develop and propose, as part of the Title V facility permit application, a\nprotocol to allow for future physical or operational changes to be made without\nthe need for a permit modification. Each protocol must include provisions for\nevaluating potential changes for compliance with the following criteria: ('a')\nall applicable requirements with which\nthe new or changed operation or emission source must comply must already exist\nin the facility's Title V permit; and\n('b')\nthe change is not part of a project\nthat results in a significant net emissions increase as described in Part 231\nof this Title. (ii)\n\nEach\napproved protocol shall be included in the Title V facility permit. Upon\nissuance of the permit, the facility owner or operator is authorized to make\nany changes pursuant to the approved protocol without the need for a permit\nmodification provided that the facility owner or operator supplies the\ndepartment with written notification as required by Paragraph (3) of this\n\nSubdivision at least fifteen days in advance of making the proposed changes. (3)\n'Notifications'. The facility owner or operator must notify the department in writing at least f\nif teen days in advance of making any change pursuant to Paragraph (2) of this\n\nSubdivision. The department shall respond in writing with a determination\nwithin 15 days of receipt of the notification. Notifications made pursuant to\nthis paragraph shall contain the following information: (i) Identification of the emission unit, process(es), emission source(s), and emission point(s) affected by the proposed\nchange with any applicable revisions to the emission unit structure; (ii)\n\nDescription of the proposed change, including the operating parameters affected; (iii)\n\nIdentification and description of any\nemission control device or technology that will be used; and\n(iv)\n\nDocumentation of the proposed change's\ncompliance with respect to all applicable requirements, including the\nfollowing: ('a')\n\nCalculations demonstrating\nthe emission rate potential and maximum projected annual actual emission rates\nfor all contaminants affected by the change; ('b')\n\nDocumentation demonstrating that the\nchange is not subject to the New Source Review requirements of Part 231 of this\n\nTitle; ('c')\n\nIdentification and\nevaluation of all state and federal regulations applicable to the proposed\nchange; ('d')\n\nAny additional\noperating and record keeping procedures necessary to ensure compliance with all\napplicable requirements; and\n('e')\n\nAny other relevant information used for the evaluation of the proposed change\nunder the protocol. (4)\n\nThe department reserves the right to\nrequire a permit modification to impose applicable requirements or permit\nconditions if it determines that changes proposed pursuant to Paragraph (2) of\nthis Subdivision do not meet the criteria described in Paragraph (2) of this\n\nSubdivision, or that the changes may have a significant air quality impact. In\nsuch cases, the department shall require that the facility owner or operator\nnot undertake the proposed changes until a permit modification is issued. The\ndepartment's determination shall include a listing of any additional\ninformation necessary to complete its review of the proposed changes. (5)\n\nChanges made pursuant to the provisions\nof this Subdivision are not subject to the permit shield described in Section\n201-6.4\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart until they are incorporated into the facility's Title V facility\npermit. (6)\n'Reserved'. (g) 'Permit shield'. (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this\n\nSubpart, the department shall include a provision in the title V permit stating\nthat compliance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance\nwith any applicable requirements as of the date of permit issuance. This permit\nshield applies provided the applicable requirements are included and are\nspecifically identified in the permit or the department, in acting on the\npermit application or modification, determines in writing that other\nrequirements specifically identified are not applicable to the major facility, and the permit includes the determination or a concise summary thereof. (2)\n\nNothing herein shall preclude\nthe department from modifying or revoking the permit pursuant to Part 621 of\nthis Title or from exercising its summary abatement authority, or alter or\naffect the following: (i) the ability of the\ndepartment to seek to bring suit on behalf of the State of New York, or the\nadministrator to seek to bring suit on behalf of the United States, to\nimmediately restrain any person causing or contributing to pollution presenting\nan imminent and substantial endangerment to public health, welfare or the\nenvironment to stop the emission of air pollutants causing or contributing to\nsuch pollution; (ii)\nthe liability\nof an owner or operator of a title V facility for any violation of applicable\nrequirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance; (iii)\nthe applicable requirements of title IV\nof the act; or\n(iv)\nthe ability of\nthe administrator to obtain information from a facility owner or operator\nconcerning the ability to enter, inspect and monitor the facility. (h) 'Term of permits'. The following time periods shall apply to the term of title V facility permits: (1)\n\nPeriods of up to five years for title V\nfacility permits and general permits f or facilities subject to this\n\nSubpart. (2)\nA fixed term of five\nyears for \"affected sources.\" Title V permits for \"affected sources\" will be\nissued in such a manner as to eliminate inconsistencies between the expiration\nof the title V permit and the effective dates of applicable requirements under\ntitle IV of the act. (i) 'Reopening f or cause'. (1)\nA title V permit\nshall be reopened and modified under any of the following circumstances: (i) When additional applicable requirements\nunder the act become applicable to a title V facility with a remaining permit\nterm of three or more years, a reopening shall be completed not later than 18\nmonths after promulgation of the applicable requirement. No such reopening is\nrequired if the effective date of the requirement is later than the date on\nwhich the permit is due to expire, unless the original permit or any of its\nterms and conditions has been extended by the department pursuant to the\nprovisions of section 201- 6.6 of this Subpart. (ii)\n\nThe department or the administrator\ndetermines that the permit contains a material mistake or that inaccurate\nstatements were made in establishing the emissions standards or other terms or\nconditions of the permit. (iii)\n\nThe\ndepartment or the administrator determines that the title V permit must be\nmodified or reopened to assure compliance with applicable\nrequirements. (iv)\n\nAdditional\nrequirements (including excess emissions requirements) become applicable to an\n\"affected source\" under the Acid Rain Program. Upon approval by the\nadministrator, excess emissions offset plans shall be deemed to be incorporated\ninto the permit. (2)\n\nProceedings to reopen and issue a title V facility permit shall be required to\nfollow the same procedures as apply to initial permit issuance but shall affect\nonly those parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists. (3)\n\nReopenings shall not be initiated before\na notice of such intent is provided to the facility by the department at least\n30 days in advance of the date that the permit is to be reopened, except that\nthe department may provide a shorter time period in the case of an\nemergency.
