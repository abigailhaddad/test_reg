  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1960.4 - Use of POTW and MS4\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as set\nforth in subdivision (c) of this section, disposal of wastewater is prohibited\nto other than POTW. (1)\n\nThe disposal of\nsanitary wastewater and industrial wastewater is prohibited to other than the\nPOTW from premises required to connect thereto under section\n1960.3\nof this Part, except that\ncertain industrial wastes may be discharged after suitable treatment to the\ndiversion sewer, storm sewers, or to watercourses, under provisions of the\n\nClean Water Act, as amended, provided that a valid SPDES discharge permit for\nsuch discharge is in effect. (2)\n\nAny person who erects, constructs or maintains a privy, cesspool or septic tank\non any property accessible to the POTW shall be deemed and shall be declared to\nbe erecting, constructing and maintaining a nuisance, which nuisance the water\nboard is authorized to abate in the manner provided by law. (3)\n\nThe disposal of hauled wastes, including\nsanitary waste from septic tanks or portable toilets into the POTW shall be\nprohibited except as permitted in writing by the director and for a fee as\nestablished in section\n1960.8\nof this Part. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding any of the provisions\nabove, nothing herein contained shall prohibit a user to dispose of wastes by\nany other legally prescribed methods. (b) POTW and MS4 limitations or prohibitions\nand limitations. (1)\n\nNo person shall discharge\nor allow to be discharged any sanitary or contaminated wastewater to the water\nboard's MS4. (2)\n\nNo person shall\ndischarge or allow to be discharged uncontaminated storm water runoff, uncontaminated surface runoff or uncontaminated cooling water to any sanitary\nsewer. (3)\n\nNo person shall allow\nexcessive amounts of infiltration to any sanitary or combined sewer. (4)\n\nNo person shall discharge or allow to be\ndischarged inflow to any sanitary sewer. (5)\n\nUsers for whom water board MS4 access is\nnot presently provided or whose premises are not located within 100 feet of the\ndiversion sewer or water courses suitable to receive uncontaminated cooling\nwater, storm water runoff, or pretreated industrial wastewaters meeting the\nwater board's SPDES discharge permit limits may, upon receiving written\npermission from the director, discharge such waters to the combined sewers. When the MS4 is constructed and made available by the water board to receive\nsuch waters, the yard piping shall be modified, within such time period as\nprescribed by the director, to separate these waters from industrial and/or\nsanitary wastewaters. Appropriate separate connections shall be made to the\nsanitary sewer and MS4. However, users located near watercourses or the\ndiversion sewer into which such waters may be discharged shall modify as\nnecessary their yard piping, within such time period as prescribed by the\ndirector, to discharge only industrial process wastewater and/or sanitary\nwastewater to the sanitary or combined sewer. Such users may discharge\nuncontaminated cooling water and such pretreated industrial wastewater to the\nwatercourses, the diversion sewer or to the MS4. Such cooling waters and\npretreated industrial wastewaters shall require individual SPDES discharge\npermits. (6)\n\nIndustrial plants or\nothers taking water from any source other than the POTW for use in cooling or\nas process water or for any other purpose shall report such quantities and\ntheir ultimate disposal, whether to sanitary sewers, storm sewers, or diversion\nsewer, to the director in writing as requested. (7)\n\nAny user, whether an SIU or not, discharging to the diversion sewer shall provide a continuously and immediately\naccessible control manhole suitable for inspection, observation, sampling, testing and measurement of discharge. (c) The following discharges to the MS4 are\nacceptable unless NYSDEC or the water board has determined them to be\nsubstantial contributors of pollutants: (1)\nwater line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or\nlawn watering, existing diverted stream flows, rising ground water, uncontaminated ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped\nground water, foundation or footing drains, crawl space or basement sump pumps, air conditioning condensate, irrigation water, springs, water from individual\nresidential car washing, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges, residential street wash water, water\nfrom fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing\npollutants. Such exempt discharges shall be made in accordance with an\nappropriate plan for reducing pollutants. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
