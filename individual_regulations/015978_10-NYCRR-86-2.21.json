(5)\n\nFacility. The term\nfacility\nshall mean a proprietary residential health care facility, as the term\nresidential health care facility\nis defined in article 28 of the Public Health Law and in regulations of the department.

The term\ninitial allowed facility\ncost shall mean the portion of certified costs approved by the commissioner or, in the case of facilities granted operating certificates prior to April 15, 1973, the costs of the facility as verified by audit to the satisfaction of the commissioner or, in the case of facilities not able to comply with either of the foregoing standards, costs imputed pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, in or prior to the first year of useful facility life attributable to the acquisition of land and the construction, acquisition or renovation of building and nonmovable equipment. The commissioner shall disregard any costs relating to prior transactions involving the facility which he finds were not bona fide or the terms of which are found to be other than fair and reasonable. (7)\n\nUseful facility life. The term\nuseful facility life\nshall mean a period of 40 years measured from the calendar year in which a facility commences operations as determined by the commissioner. (8)\n\nRate of return. The term\nrate of return\nshall mean the annual rate of return on equity invested, and said rate for a rate year shall be equal to the yield on 30-year United States Treasury bonds in effect on the second Wednesday of September of the year prior to the rate year. (9)\n\nCapital improvement.

The term\nhospital-based residential health care facility\nshall mean a facility holding a certificate of operation as a residential health care facility which is wholly owned by a hospital as that term is defined in Subpart 86-1 of this Title, and is physically located in a building or buildings, part of which building or buildings are also used for provision of acute care hospital services. (12)\n\nEffective term. The term effective term shall mean the number of years and months required, pursuant to the term of the note or mortgage, to fully amortize the principal of the debt, predicated upon the regular principal payments required by the mortgage or note, but determined without regard to any provision for making the balance all due and payable at a given date or upon a stated event, and without regard to any provision for acceleration of the debt or any original or subsequent agreement for the suspension or moratorium of principal payments. (b) Subject to subdivision (f) of this section, the reimbursement rate of every facility certified by the commissioner and approved by the State Director of the Budget pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law shall, in each year of useful facility life, include a capital cost component determined in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (c), (d) or (e) of this section applicable to the facility in such year. (c) (1)\n\nThe provisions of subdivision (e) of this section shall not apply for the term prescribed by paragraph (3) of this subdivision to any facility which, as of the effective date of this section, is located in and operated from leased space pursuant to a lease: (i) which was entered into and approved for reimbursement prior to March 10, 1975; and\n(ii)\nwhich the commissioner finds to be bona fide, valid and noncancelable; and\n(iii)\nthe payments, or a portion thereof, made pursuant to such lease are found by the commissioner to have been the proper basis for reimbursement of capital cost paid to such facility pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law prior to March 10, 1975. (2)\n\nThe capital cost component of a facility within the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall, for the term prescribed by paragraph (3) of this subdivision, consist of a payment factor sufficient to reimburse the facility for the total payments required under its lease to the extent approved by the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, and subject to the historical limitations set forth by the commissioner. (3)\n\nCapital cost reimbursement for leased facilities shall be made pursuant to this subdivision for the balance of the lease term (computed without regard to any future extension or option to renew authorized by the lease) remaining as of the effective date of this subdivision. Upon the expiration of such balance of the lease term provided in an approved lease (as said lease so provides as of August 1, 1977) or such earlier expiration date as may be agreed to by the parties to an approved lease, capital cost reimbursement shall be made pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section notwithstanding any extension or renewal of such lease or the execution of a new lease by or on behalf of the facility; provided, however, that the commissioner may, in his discretion, continue capital cost reimbursement for such leased facilities pursuant to this subdivision, at a rental amount approved by the commissioner prior to such extension or renewal, and not pursuant to subdivision (e), upon his finding that there is a public need for such facility at the time and place and under the circumstances proposed and that the continued operation of such facility would be jeopardized by a limitation of reimbursement pursuant to subdivision (e). (4)\nA lease with a related organization described in subdivision (a) or (d) of section\n86-2.26\nof this Subpart shall be deemed to be a non-arms length lease. (5)\n\nAny capital expenditures associated with non-arms length leases shall be approved and certified to, if required, pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law. In the computation of reimbursement for non-arms length leases, the capital cost shall be included in allowable costs only to the extent that it does not exceed the amount which the facility would have included in allowable costs if it had legal title to the asset (the cost of ownership), such as straight-line depreciation, insurance, and interest. Accelerated depreciation on these assets may not be included in allowable costs under any circumstances. (d) The provisions of subdivision (e) of this section shall not apply to hospital-based residential health care facilities. Such facilities will be reimbursed pursuant to capital cost regulations in Subpart 86-1 of this Part. (e) (1)\n\nSubject to the provisions of subdivisions (c), (d) and (f) of this section, the capital cost component for every facility shall consist of the payment factors provided in this subdivision that, in any year of useful facility life, are applicable to the facility. (2)\n\nInterest. The capital cost component shall, in each year of useful facility life, include a payment factor sufficient to reimburse, at a rate which the commissioner finds to be reasonable under the circumstances prevailing at the time of the placing of the capital indebtedness, interest on capital indebtedness. (3)\n\nAmortization. (i) Subject to the limitations of paragraph (5) of this subdivision, the capital cost component shall, in each year of useful facility life, include a payment factor sufficient to reimburse the amortization component of capital indebtedness pursuant to the terms of the mortgage note or bond. (ii)\n\nThe capital indebtedness of a facility, to the extent that the original principal of such debt does not exceed the initial allowed facility cost of the facility, shall be recognized as follows: (a) For capital indebtedness with an effective term of 10 years or less, amortization expense will be recognized for the purpose of reimbursement only, if the schedule of debt amortization is within the limitation set forth in section\n86-2.21\n(e)(5)\nof this Subpart for each of the years of debt amortization. (b) For capital indebtedness with an effective term in excess of 10 years, amortization expense will be recognized for the purpose of reimbursement upon a determination by the commissioner that the following standards are met: (1)\nthe debt is incurred for authorized purposes; (2)\nthe interest rate is reasonable for the time and place in which the capital indebtedness is committed, and for the type of indebtedness associated with the interest rate; (3)\nthe amortization schedule is reasonable (amortization must be required in each year of the mortgage in accordance with the established financial practices); (4)\nthe effective term is consistent with customary commercial practices in the geographic area of the facility; and\n(5)\nthe effective term is in accordance with efficient production of services. (c) For capital indebtedness other than first mortgages, the amortization expense will be recognized for the purpose of reimbursement upon a determination by the commissioner that the debt, complies with the standards set forth in section\n86-2.21\n(e)(3)(ii)\n(\nb\n) of this Subpart, and the following additional standards: (1)\nthey must be incurred for the purpose of financing either an approved purchase or construction of a facility; and\n(2)\nthe effective term of financing for a capital improvement is reasonable when compared to the estimated useful life of the improvement. (d) Capital indebtedness for any unauthorized purpose will not be recognized for any reimbursement purpose. (4)\n\nReturn of equity. Subject to the limitations of paragraph (5) of this subdivision, the capital cost component shall include a payment factor sufficient to return equity. A facility shall be eligible for the return of equity commencing in the first year following the department's determination, among other factors, that the facility has the ability to meet current capital indebtedness (including principal and interest) over the balance of useful facility life. This shall mean that within the confines of the regulations expressed in this Subpart, capital reimbursement will be sufficient to provide for the remaining amortization of capital indebtedness. The commissioner's determination shall also take into account such factors as the age, size, location and condition of the facility, and the financial condition of the facility. (5)\n\nLimitation. (i) Annual reimbursement payments for capital cost under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subdivision shall not at any time result in a cumulative average payment in excess of three and three one-hundredths percent of initial allowed facility cost. For years prior to 1981, actual amortization or depreciation paid by Medicaid will be used in the computation of the limitation. For years prior to Medicaid or in years when Medicaid payments did not include an expense equivalent of depreciation or amortization, a three and three one-hundredths percent payment will be imputed. (ii)\n\nThis limitation may be waived by the commissioner where a facility applies to the commissioner for approval to refinance an existing mortgage because its recognized amortization expense exceeds the amount of allowable reimbursement for amortization of principal and interest expense (including credit from prior amortization reimbursement). In those instances where the commissioner determines that it would be more expensive to reimburse the debt service that would be incurred if the facility refinanced the remaining principal, than it would be to continue to reimburse the debt service on the existing mortgage, the commissioner may reimburse up to the actual debt service incurred by the facility under the existing mortgage, plus return on equity in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nReturn on equity. The capital cost component for every facility shall include a payment factor sufficient to pay an annual rate of return on average equity, as such average annual equity shall be determined by the commissioner in each year of useful facility life. (7)\n\nResidual reimbursement. After the expiration of useful facility life, the commissioner may approve a payment factor for any facility for which he determines that continued capital cost reimbursement is appropriate; provided, however, that such payment factor shall not exceed one half of the capital cost reimbursement received by such facility in the final year of useful facility life. (8)\n\nCapital improvement cost reimbursement. (i) The capital improvement cost shall be reimbursed by adjusting the initial allowed facility cost, capital indebtedness, equity determinations and limitations as stated in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, to include the capital improvement cost. (ii)\n\nAdjustments in accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be made in the following manner: (a) if the cost of an improvement is $100,000 or more, and certificate of need approval has been granted by the commissioner, then component useful life for the improvement will be permitted. Such component useful life will be equivalent to the estimated asset life in accordance with the\n\nMedicare Provider Reimbursement Manual\nor the remaining useful life of the facility, whichever is less. Where a capital improvement adjusts the expected useful life of the facility beyond the remaining portion of the original useful facility life, the limitation set forth in section\n86-2.21\n(e)(5)\nof this Subpart, will be increased to allow for the reimbursement of the amortization component of the debt obtained to finance the improvement. (b) If the cost of an improvement is less than $100,000, then the cost will be reimbursed over the remaining portion of the expected useful life. In such instances the reimbursement will commence with either the reporting of such costs on an annual certified cost report or, upon submission of a cost report, certified by an independent public accountant, whichever is submitted first. In either event, the reporting of such costs must be accompanied by a sworn statement by the administrator or the chief fiscal officer of the facility to the effect that the improvements made are not part of a number of planned related projects which, in the aggregate, total $100,000 or more. (c) If the cost of an improvement is less than $100,000 and: (1)\nis undertaken as the result of an emergency situation; (2)\naffects the health and safety of the patients; and\n(3)\nthe facility can demonstrate dire financial condition; then the limitation set forth in section\n86-2.21\n(e)(6)\nof this Subpart will be modified to allow for the reimbursement of the debt service associated with the financing of the approved capital improvement over the effective term of the obligation or five years, whichever is greater. Any contribution to the improvement by the facility and not financed by the debt obligation will be considered an equity contribution and an adjustment to the facility's total capital equity will be made. (d) If a facility undertakes an authorized improvement without incurring additional debt, then the facility will receive a return on equity and, when a determina tion has been made in accordance with section\n86-2.21\n(e)(4)\nof this Subpart, a return of equity, for the funds invested in the improvement. (f) (1)\n\nWith respect to facilities granted operating certificates prior to March 10, 1975, the commissioner may modify or provide exceptions to subdivision (c) or (e) of this section in circumstances where he finds that application of the provisions of either subdivision would result in (1) excessive reimbursement to the facility, or (ii) severe economic hardship to the facility not caused by circumstances reasonably under the control of the facility. In determining severe economic hardship, the commissioner shall consider such factors as debt service required on capital indebtedness, prior withdrawal of assets from the facility, and the financial condition of the facility in general. In such cases where the commissioner makes a finding of severe economic hardship, the capital cost component of the rate shall not exceed the debt service on capital indebtedness. (2)\n\nThe commissioner may revise the capital cost component of the reimbursement rate applicable to any facility which he determines is based upon previous error, deceit or any other misrepresentation or misstatement by the facility. (3)\n\nThe capital cost component shall not be affected by any sale, lease or transfer occurring after March 10, 1975. (g) In lieu of determining initial allowed facility cost pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, the commissioner may estimate the original fair and reasonable cost of the facility with due regard for the fair and reasonable cost of facilities of comparable age, size, location and condition, and impute an initial allowed facility cost to: (1)\nevery facility for which records on the historical cost or book value of land, building or nonmovable equipment are not available or not verifiable to the satisfaction of the commissioner; (2)\nevery leased facility which, as of the effective date of this section, is not eligible for reimbursement pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section; (3)\nevery facility which, after the effective date of this section, ceases to be eligible for reimbursement pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section and becomes eligible for reimbursement pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section; or\n(4)\nevery facility whose construction was completed prior to the calendar year in which this section becomes effective and whose initial facility year occurs in or after the calendar year in which this section becomes effective. (h) In the event that a facility fails to submit information necessary for the implementation of this section, after notification pursuant to subdivision (f) of section\n86-2.2\nof this Subpart, the capital cost component of the rate shall consist of interest, if reported, and amortization not in excess of the lesser of the amortization payment required under capital indebtedness, or 2<< percent of initial allowed facility cost. (i) (1)\n\nThe limitation provision of paragraph (e)(5) of this section may be waived for certain qualifying facilities. In order to be considered a qualifying transaction, all of the following conditions must be met: (i) A sale or transfer between nonrelated parties must take place. (ii)\n\nThe purchaser must assume the seller's remaining mortgage repayment schedule at the associated fixed rate of interest. (iii)\n\nThe difference between the unpaid principal balance of the seller's mortgage (first mortgage) and the Medicaid-allowable transfer price must be generated either from second mortgage proceeds or contributed equity capital or both. (iv)\n\nThe annual amount of allowable interest expense incurred as described in this section, under the terms of the first and second mortgage, plus the annual principal debt amortization must be less than that which would otherwise be reimbursed pursuant to this section, if no assumption of the existing first mortgage were made. (This comparison is hereinafter referred to as the comparative analysis test.) For purposes of this subdivision, the loan-financed portion of the Medicaid-allowable transfer price shall be held constant and the comparative analysis test shall be applied to each year of the effective term of the first and second mortgages. In instances where more than one facility is involved in the transaction, the facilities may be combined for purposes of the comparative analysis test. (2)\n\nQualifying facilities shall be reimbursed principal debt amortization, interest and return of equity in the following manner: (i) Principal debt amortization. In each year, during the effective term of the mortgage, the capital cost component of the rate shall include a payment factor sufficient to reimburse the principal debt amortization component of the allowable portion of the mortgage. (ii)\n\nInterest. The capital cost component shall include a payment factor sufficient to reimburse interest associated with the allowable portion of the mortgage as defined by paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (iii)\n\nReturn of equity. The equity portion of the Medicaid-allowable transfer price shall be reimbursed in equal annual amounts beginning in the first year following the expiration of the term of the mortgages over the remaining useful facility life.
