  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 527.4 - Sale of services of producing, fabricating, processing, printing or imprinting\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1105(c)(2)\n(a) Imposition. (1)\n\nSection\n1105 (c)(2)\nof the Tax Law\nimposes a tax on the receipts from services of producing, fabricating, processing, printing or imprinting tangible personal property, performed for a\nperson who directly or indirectly furnishes the property. (2)\n\nThe enumerated services are not taxable\nwhen: (i) purchased for resale; or\n(ii)\nperformed on property intended for\nresale. (3)\n\nFurnishing\n\"indirectly\" means that items of tangible personal property are supplied to the\nperson performing the enumerated services by an agent or other person on behalf\nof the customer; or when the items of tangible personal property are not\nsupplied by the person performing the enumerated services at the direction of\nthe customer. (4)\n\nWhen such\nservices are combined with the sale of property by the person performing the\nservices, the entire transaction is subject to tax as a retail sale. (See\nsection\n526.6\nof\nthis Title.)\n(b) Producing. Producing\nmeans the manufacture of a\nproduct from one or more raw materials and any process in which a raw material\nloses its identity when the production process is completed. Example 1: An individual purchases tweed cloth from a retail textile\nstore and has a tailor make a suit for the individual to wear. The tailor's\ncharge for the service of making the suit is taxable. Example 2: A corporation purchases lumber from a mill and has the\nlumber taken to a cabinetmaker who uses the lumber to build a bookcase for use\nin its corporate offices. The cabinetmaker's charge to build the bookcase is\ntaxable. (c) Fabricating. Fabricating\nis the alteration or\nmodification of tangible personal property to the specifications of the\npurchaser of the service, without changing the identity of the property. However, alterations to clothing do not constitute fabricating; rather they\nconstitute tailoring services and are excluded from tax. (See section\n527.5\n[b][3]\nof this Part). Example 1: An individual purchases sheet metal from a supplier and\ntakes the sheet metal to a metal shop to be cut, perforated, and bent to the\nindividual's specifications, for the individual's own use. The metal shop's\ncharge for these services is taxable. Example 2: A lumber yard charges a corporation for cutting 4 foot by 8\nfoot sheets of plywood into 2 foot by 2 foot squares. The plywood had been\npurchased for the purchaser's own use. The lumber yard's charge for the cutting\nservices is taxable. (If the lumber yard sold the plywood to the corporation\nand cut it into squares at the time of sale, then its charge to cut the plywood\nis taxable as part of the sale of tangible personal property, pursuant to\nparagraph [a][4] of this section.)\n(d) Processing. Processing is the performance of any service on tangible\npersonal property for the owner which effects a change in the nature, shape, or\nform of the property. Example 1: A person raises a hog for his own food. He has the hog\nslaughtered dressed, cut and wrapped by a butcher. The butcher's services are\ntaxable. Example 2: The developing of film by a photographic laboratory is a\ntaxable processing service. Example 3: A person cuts, edits, dubs sound, and adds titles to\nconvert exposed and developed film footage into a completed film. Such\nprocedures constitute taxable processing of the film. Example 4: A firm which owns existing computer programs of the metal\nbar type and the imprinted electronic tape type asks a service organization to\nchange the programs. For the metal bar type, the change is effected by\nrearranging, adding or removing metal pins. For the taped program, the change\nis effected by altering the imprint on the tape. The services provided\nconstitute processing the metal bars and tapes. (e) Printing and imprinting. (1)\n\nThe services of printing and imprinting\ntangible personal property furnished by or on behalf of a customer of the\nprinter are taxable under section\n1105 (c)(2)\nof the Tax Law; the service of printing or imprinting tangible personal property which is sold\nby the person performing the service in conjunction with the sale is taxable as\npart of the sale under section\n1105 (a)\nof the Tax Law. Example 1: A printer prints a form letter on letterhead stationery\nfurnished by his customer. The printer's services are taxable. Example 2: A firm addresses envelopes furnished by its customer. The\naddressing services are a taxable printing service. Example 3: A printer prints business calling cards for his customer, supplying both the card and the service of printing. This is the sale of\ntangible personal property, the total amount being taxable as such. (See\nsection\n526.6\nof\nthis Title.)\n\nExample 4: A corporation has its bonds printed by a printer, and has\nits supplier furnish the embossed paper to the printer. The printer's services\nare taxable, whether or not possession of the embossed paper has passed to the\ncorporation, and regardless of the fact that the embossed paper has been\nsupplied to the printer by a third party, on behalf of the\ncorporation. (2)\n\nFor rules\nconcerning the collection and reporting of sales taxes on bulk printing and\nmailing of advertising matter see Part 543 of this Title. (f) Resale. (1)\n\nWhen the services enumerated in this\nsection are rendered on property held for resale, the services are not taxable. Example 1: A manufacturer of home appliances has certain of the\ncomponent appliance parts galvanized by a plating firm. The service of\ngalvanizing is not taxable since it is being performed on a product which will\nbe sold by the manufacturer. (2)\n\nWhere a person performing a service\nsubject to tax purchases tangible personal property, which becomes a part of\nthe property on which the services are performed or which is later transferred\nto the purchaser of the service in conjunction with the service performed, the\npurchase of the property is for resale and is not subject to the sales tax. Example 2: A plating company purchases zinc for galvanizing steel\nwhich is furnished by its customer. The zinc becomes part of the steel. The\npurchase of the zinc by the plating company is a purchase for resale which is\nnot subject to tax. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
