  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 203-4.4 - Reciprocating Compressors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe requirements of this\nsection apply to reciprocating natural gas compressors located at natural gas\ntransmission compressor stations, and natural gas underground storage\nfacilities. (2)\n\nThe requirements of\nthis section do not apply to reciprocating natural gas compressors that operate\nfewer than 200 hours over a rolling twelve (12) month period total, provided\nthat the owner or operator: (i) Maintains a\nnon-resettable hour meter on the engine, and\n(ii)\n\nMaintains a record, for a minimum of\nfive (5) years, of the operating hours per month, and\n(iii)\n\nProvides a rolling twelve (12) month\ntotal calculation of hours to the Department once per year. (b) Beginning January 1, 2023, components on driver engines and compressors shall comply with the LDAR\nrequirements specified in Subpart 203-7, except for the rod packing components\nsubject to subdivision\n203-4.4\n(c) and, (c) The compressor rod packing\nor seal emission flow rate through the rod packing or seal vent stack shall be\nmeasured annually by direct measurement (high volume sampling, bagging, calibrated flow measuring instrument) while the compressor is running at normal\noperating temperature using one of the following methods: (1)\n\nVent stacks shall be equipped with a\nmeter or instrumentation to measure the rod packing or seal emissions flow\nrate; or, (2)\n\nVent stacks shall be\nequipped with a clearly identified access port installed at a height of no more\nthan six (6) feet above ground level or a permanent support surface for making\nindividual or combined rod packing or seal emission flow rate\nmeasurements. (3)\n\nIf the\nmeasurement is not obtained because the compressor is not operating for the\nscheduled test date and the remainder of the inspection period, then testing\nshall be conducted within seven (7) days of resumed operation. The owner or\noperator shall maintain, and make available upon request by the Department, a\ncopy of operating records that document the compressor hours of operation and\nrun dates and a signed statement from the responsible official in order to\ndemonstrate compliance with this requirement. (d) Beginning January 1, 2023, compressor\nvent stacks used to vent rod packing or seal emissions shall be controlled with\nthe use of a vapor collection system as specified in Subpart 203-8; or, (e) A compressor with a rod\npacking or seal with a measured emission flow rate greater than two (2) scfm, or a combined rod packing or seal emission flow rate greater than the number of\ncompression cylinders multiplied by two (2) scfm, shall be successfully\nrepaired within thirty (30) days from the date of the initial emission flow\nrate measurement. (1)\n\nAn extension to the\nthirty (30) day deadline may be granted by the Department if the owner or\noperator can demonstrate that the parts or equipment required to make necessary\nrepairs have been ordered and the owner or operator notifies the Department as\nspecified in Section\n203-10.3\nto report the delay and\nprovides an estimated time by which the repairs will be completed. (f) The owner or operator shall\nmaintain for at least five (5) years a record of the flow rate measurement and\nshall report the result to the Department within sixty (60) days after\ncompleted. (g) A reciprocating\nnatural gas compressor with a rod packing or seal emission flow rate measured\nabove the standard specified as a critical component shall be successfully\nrepaired by the end of the next scheduled process shutdown or within twelve\n(12) months from the date of the initial flow rate measurement, whichever is\nsooner.

Tit. 6\n§§\n203-4.4\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register February 16, 2022/Volume XLIV, Issue 07, eff. 3/3/2022\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
