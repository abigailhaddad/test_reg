  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2202.8 - Return on capital value\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nlandlord may file an application for an increase in maximum rents on the ground\nthat the current maximum gross building rental established pursuant to section\n2201.4 or\n2201.5\nof this Title does not equal\nthe sum of: (1)\nthe real estate taxes, water\ncharges and sewer rents on the property; (2)\nthe operating and maintenance expenses of\nthe property; (3)\nan allowance for\nthe vacancy and collection losses on the property; and\n(4)\na return of 81/2 percent on capital value\nwhich, except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, shall be\nthe equalized assessed value obtained by multiplying the current assessed value\nof the property by the current equalization ratio established by the New York\n\nState Board of Equalization and Assessment pursuant to article 12-A of the Real\n\nProperty Tax Law. Increases or decreases in real estate taxes, water\ncharges, sewer rents, and wages currently in effect may be projected in making\nsuch computation. (b) The administrator may make a\ndetermination that: (1)\ncapital value is an\namount different from that prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section, where\nthere has been a reduction in assessed valuation for the year next preceding\nthe effective date of the assessed valuation in effect at the time of the\nfiling of the application; or\n(2)\ncapital value is equal to five times the equalized assessed value of the\nbuildings, where the assessed valuation of the land exceeds four times the\nassessed valuation of the buildings thereon. (c) The administrator may make a\ndetermination that capital value is an amount different from that prescribed in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, where there has been a bona fide sale of the\nproperty since February 1, 1961, as the result of a transaction at arm's\nlength, on normal financing terms, at a readily ascertainable price, and\nunaffected by special circumstances such as, but not limited to, a forced sale, exchange of property, package deal, wash sale or a sale to a cooperative. In\ndetermining whether a sale was on normal financing terms, the administrator\nshall give due consideration to the following factors: (1)\nthe ratio of the cash payment received by\nthe seller to the sales price of the property and the annual gross income from\nthe property; (2)\nthe total amount\nof the outstanding mortgages which are liens against the property (including\npurchase money mortgages), as compared with the equalized assessed value of the\nproperty; (3)\nthe ratio of the\nsales price to the annual gross income of the property, with consideration\ngiven to the total amount of rent adjustments previously granted, exclusive of\nrent adjustments because of changes in dwelling space, services, furniture, furnishings or equipment, major capital improvements or substantial\nrehabilitation; (4)\nthe presence of\ndeferred amortization in purchase money mortgages, or the assignment of such\nmortgages at a discount; and\n(5)\nany other facts and circumstances surrounding such sale which, in the judgment\nof the administrator, may have a bearing upon the question of\nfinancing. (d) No\nincrease in maximum rent shall be granted under this section where there is\npending, without final disposition, a judicial proceeding to correct the final\ndetermination of the Tax Commission with respect to the assessed valuation of\nsuch property for the city fiscal year in which the landlord filed the\napplication for such increase, or for the city fiscal year immediately\npreceding the filing of the application for such increase. (e) No application for an increase in any\nmaximum rent under this section may be filed with respect to any property if\n(1) on the date that the application is sought to be filed, less than two years\nhave elapsed since the date of filing of the last prior application for an\nincrease under this section, which application resulted in the granting of an\nincrease, or (2) less than two years have elapsed since the last sale of the\nproperty and the application is based upon a sales price in excess of the\nequalized assessed valuation. This latter limitation shall not apply, however, when the application is based upon a sale, within such two-year period, at a\nprice in excess of the equalized assessed valuation, if such price is less than\nthe price in the last sale which meets the criteria heretofore specified in\nsubdivision (c) of this section occurring prior to two years before the\napplication is sought to be filed. (f) For the purposes of this section, the\ntest year shall be the most recent full calendar year or the landlord's most\nrecent fiscal year, or any 12 consecutive months ending not more than 90 days\nprior to the filing of the application for an increase.
