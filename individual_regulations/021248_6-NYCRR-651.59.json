  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 651.59 - Grant payments\n\nState Regulations\nA two-payment reimbursement procedure will be applied\nby the commissioner to all applicants who qualify for State assistance. The\nfirst payment will be awarded after approval of each application by the\ncommissioner. The second payment will not be awarded until completion of the\nfirst payment procedure for all municipalities applying for operation and\nmaintenance aid in that fiscal year. (a) First payment. The first payment will be\ndetermined by applying a uniform rate of reimbursement to the total eligible\ncosts of each qualified applicant. The uniform rate of reimbursement will be\nestablished each State fiscal year by the commissioner and will be the same for\nall applicants. The first payment will be approved or denied, in total, contingent upon the applicant's demonstrated ability to comply with all grant\nrequirements and conditions. Funding for the first payment will be obtained\nfrom the portion of the State appropriation for operation and maintenance aid\nawards appropriated for that purpose. (b) Second payment. The second payment will\nbe made using funds from two sources: (1)\n\nThe\nremaining amount of the funds appropriated for a uniform rate of reimbursement\nwill be approved or denied using the same criteria as subdivision (a) of this\nsection. The percentage rate of reimbursement for this second payment will be\nset at a rate which will fully expend the funds appropriated for a uniform rate\nof reimbursement. This rate will be the same for all applicants. (2)\n\nThe performance portion of each operation\nand maintenance aid grant will be approved in total or in part, or denied, based on a performance factor to be determined for each applicant. The\nperformance factor will be calculated by comparing selected parameter\nconcentrations, limits, or loadings allowed by the applicant's State Pollutant\n\nDischarge Elimination System (SPDES) permit with the actual annual average\nconcentrations or loadings of the respective parameters in each sewage\ntreatment plant's discharge. A mathematical formula will be established by the\ncommissioner for determining the performance factor, which will be a proportion\ndetermined by dividing the permitted effluent limit for each selected parameter\nby the actual annual average concentration or loading for that parameter and\nthen taking the arithmetic mean of those values. If the proportion thus\ndetermined exceeds 1.0, a value of 1.0 will be used as the performance factor. The performance payment will be made from funds appropriated for that\npurpose. (c) If the\nfirst payment is denied in total, then the second payment (the uniform rate and\nthe performance rate) will also be denied in total. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n651.59\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
