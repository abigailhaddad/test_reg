  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8.88 - Executive order no. 88: directing state agencies and authorities to improve the energy efficiency of state buildings\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, New York is dedicated to the mutually compatible\ngoals of environmental protection, energy security, and economic growth; and\nWHEREAS, increasing energy efficiency has been identified\nas among the most cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas and other\nenvironmental pollutant emissions and increasing energy security; and\nWHEREAS, increasing energy efficiency can lead to increased\njobs and a reduction in building operating expenses; and\nWHEREAS, New York is committed to implementing new policies\nto promote the efficient use of energy and natural resources in the interest of\nthe long-term protection and enhancement of the State's environment, economy\nand public health; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Andrew M. Cuomo, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nthe Laws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: I. DEFINITIONS\nFor the purposes of this Executive Order, the following\nterms are defined as follows: A. \"Affected State Entities\" means (i) all agencies and departments over which the\n\nGovernor has Executive Authority, and (ii) all public-benefit corporations, public authorities and commissions, for which the Governor appoints the Chair, the Chief Executive, or the majority of Board Members, except for the Port\n\nAuthority of New York and New Jersey. B. \"Average Source Energy Use Intensity\" or\n\"average EUI\" means the average source energy use per square foot for all\nstate-owned and managed buildings. C. \"Source energy\" means all the energy used\nin delivering energy to a site, including power generation, transmission and\ndistribution losses. II. ENERGY REDUCTION TARGET\nBy April 1, 2020, all Affected State Entities shall\ncollectively reduce the average EUI in State-owned and managed buildings by at\nleast 20% from a baseline of the average EUI of such buildings for State fiscal\nyear 2010/2011 (\"Target\"). III. OBLIGATIONS TO MEET TARGET\nA. Central Management and Implementation\n\nTeam: The New York Power Authority (\"NYPA\") shall establish a central\nmanagement and implementation team (\"CMIT\") to administer this Executive Order. (1)\n\nThe CMIT is hereby directed and\nauthorized to: (a) Take all appropriate\nmeasures to ensure that the Target is met; (b) Direct Affected State Entities to comply\nwith the requirements of this Executive Order; (c) Create guidelines (\"Guidelines\") within\nnine months of the issuance of this Executive Order to assist Affected State\n\nEntities in complying with this Executive Order, and thereafter update such\n\nGuidelines as necessary; (d) Provide strategic, technical, and other assistance to each Affected State\n\nEntity to support implementation of this Executive Order; (e) Develop annual milestones for achieving\nthe Target over the next seven years within 12 months of the issuance of this\n\nExecutive Order; (f) Develop and\nimplement reporting requirements to document each Affected State Entity's\nprogress toward meeting the Target; (g) Develop a comprehensive operations and\nmaintenance plan for the State's building portfolio to help achieve no cost and\nlow cost efficiency improvements and ensure that efficiency savings are\nsustained; and\n(h) Submit an annual\nreport to the Governor by January 15th of each year, beginning in 2014, detailing the overall progress Affected State Entities are making toward\nmeeting the Target. Requirements for the annual report shall be contained in\nthe Guidelines. (2)\n\nThe\n\nOffice of General Services and the New York State Energy Research and\n\nDevelopment Authority are hereby directed to provide technical assistance to\nthe CMIT and each of the Affected State Entities with respect to complying with\nand implementing the requirements of this Executive Order and those established\nby the CMIT pursuant to this Executive Order. B. Affected State Entities\n\nIn addition to the requirements established above, each of\nthe Affected State Entities shall comply with the following: (1)\n\nBenchmarking. For each State fiscal year, each Affected State Entity shall measure the energy use in State-owned and\nmanaged buildings having an area greater than 20,000 square feet. Buildings on\nmaster-metered campuses shall be benchmarked at the campus level until they are\nsub-metered at the building level, after which point those buildings shall be\nbenchmarked at the building level. (2)\n\nAudits. Buildings that receive low\nbenchmark scores, as defined by the Guidelines, shall undergo an American\n\nSociety of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (\"ASHRAE\")\n\nLevel II energy audit, or any other comparable audit that the CMIT approves. Campuses that have above-average EUIs or poor benchmark scores, as defined by\nthe Guidelines, or are otherwise prioritized by the Affected State Entities and\nthe CMIT, shall undergo a campus-wide ASHRAE Level II energy audit or any other\ncomparable audit approved by the CMIT. In addition to energy efficiency\nmeasures, the audits shall identify opportunities for cost-effective on-site\nrenewable generation and high-efficiency combined heat and power. (3)\n\nRequired Capital Projects and Energy\n\nOptimization Measures. Affected State Entities shall implement a cost-effective\nportfolio of measures identified and recommended in the audit and shall\ncomplete or make substantial progress toward completion of such measures within\ntwo years of completion of the audit. A portfolio may include, but shall[LM1]\nnot be limited to, no- and low-cost operational improvements, retrocommissioning, capital energy efficiency retrofits, on-site renewable and\nhigh-efficiency combined heat and power, and other measures identified by the\nCMIT. (4)\n\nSubmetering. Affected\n\nState Entities shall work with the CMIT to prioritize sub-metering for all\nrelevant energy sources of buildings larger than 100,000 square feet on a\nmaster-metered campus to identify ways to finance such sub-metering. All\nbuildings having an area larger than 100,000 square feet on master-metered\ncampuses shall be sub-metered for all fuels and other energy sources by\n\nDecember 31, 2016, to enable individual building benchmarking, unless the\n\nAffected State Entity that owns or operates the building can demonstrate to the\nCMIT that it is not cost-effective or feasible to do so. (5)\n\nIncorporating Energy Efficiency Analysis\nin the Capital Planning Process. As part of the capital planning process, all\n\nAffected State Entities shall include an energy efficiency analysis in the\ndesign phase of all capital project plans. The capital project should include\nenergy efficient measures or technologies determined to be the most\ncost-effective, as defined by the Guidelines. (6)\n\nCredits. Affected State Entities may\nreceive credit towards the Target for increasing energy efficiency in leased\nspace. In addition, Affected State Entities may receive credit towards meeting\nthe Target for installing on-site renewable generation if the host site for\nsuch renewable generation has deployed all cost-effective energy efficiency\nimprovements consistent with the goals of this Executive Order. Affected State\n\nEntities shall consult with and apply to the CMIT concerning such\ncredits. (7)\n\nReporting. No later\nthan October 1st of each calendar year, each Affected State Entity shall submit\nall information requested by the CMIT on all State-owned and managed buildings\nhaving an area over 20,000 square feet, as well as any other information\nrelated to assessing compliance with this Executive Order. C. Exemptions\n\nElectric usage attributable to vehicle charging shall not\nbe included in the Target and requirements of this Executive Order. The CMIT is\nauthorized to provide other exemptions for good cause shown pursuant to\ncriteria and procedures established in the Guidelines, including exceptions\nassociated with buildings that have obtained and maintained ENERGY STAR or\nsimilar certification, or have benchmark scores placing such buildings in the\ntop quartile of comparable buildings for the particular year at issue. Affected\n\nState Entities shall submit requests for annual exemptions to the CMIT. Any\nsuch request for exemptions and resulting determination by the CMIT shall be\nincluded in the annual report. IV. REPEAL OF PRIOR EXECUTIVE ORDERS\nExecutive Order No. 111, promulgated on June 10, 2001, is\nhereby revoked and superseded by this Executive Order as of the date\nhereof. Signed: Andrew M.
