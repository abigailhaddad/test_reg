  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 204.3 - Answer\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Filing. The respondent shall file with the director an original and 4\ncopies of an answer to the charge, with proof of service of a copy thereof on\nall other parties within 10 working days after receipt of a copy of the charge\nfrom the director. Should the chairperson authorize electronic filing of such\nanswer, the filing of a signed paper original consistent with this section and\nelectronic filing and service of a copy shall constitute compliance with the\nfiling and service requirements herein contained. The original shall be signed\nand sworn to before any person authorized to administer oaths. (b) Motion for\nparticularization of the charge. If the respondent believes that a charge is so vague and\nindefinite that it cannot reasonably be required to frame an answer, the\nrespondent may, within 10 working days after receipt of a copy of the charge\nfrom the director, file, in the same manner as would be applicable to the\nfiling of an answer, a motion with the administrative law judge, with proof of\nservice on all other parties, for an order directing the charging party to file\na verified statement supplying specified information. The charging party may\nlikewise file a response to the motion within seven working days after its\nreceipt thereof, with proof of service of a copy of the response on all other\nparties. The filing of such motion will extend the time during which the\nrespondent must file and serve its answer until 10 working days after receipt\nof the ruling of the administrative law judge on the motion, or until such\nlater date as the administrative law judge may set. The failure of a party to\ntimely comply with an order of particularization may, in the discretion of the\nadministrative law judge, constitute ground for precluding the party from\noffering any evidence as to the matters dealt with by the order. (c) Contents. (1)\n\nThe answer shall include a specific\nadmission, denial or explanation of each allegation of the charge or, if the\nrespondent is without knowledge thereof, the answer shall so state and such\nstatement shall operate as a denial. Admissions or denials may be made to all\nor part of an allegation, but shall fairly meet the circumstances of the\nallegation. (2)\n\nThe answer shall\ninclude a specific, detailed statement of any affirmative defense, including\nbut not limited to an allegation that the violation occurred more than four\nmonths before the filing of the charge. A clear and concise statement of the\nfacts supporting any affirmative defense, including the names of the\nindividuals involved and the date and place of the occurrence of each\nparticular act alleged, shall be set forth. An answer to an alleged violation\nof section 209-a.1(g) of the act shall identify the statute, interest\narbitration award, collectively negotiated agreement, policy, or practice that\nforms the basis of the employer's affirmative defense, if any. (d) Motion for\nparticularization of the answer. If the charging party believes that the statement of facts\nsupporting any affirmative defense is so vague and indefinite that such\ncharging party cannot reasonably be expected to address them in an expeditious\nmanner at a hearing, such charging party may, within 10 working days after\nreceipt of the answer, file with the administrative law judge in the same\nmanner applicable to the filing of the charge a motion for an order directing\nthe respondent to file a verified statement supplying specified information. The respondent may file a response to the motion within seven working days\nafter its receipt thereof, with proof of service of a copy of the response on\nall other parties. The failure of a party to timely comply with an order of\nparticularization may, in the discretion of the administrative law judge, constitute grounds for precluding the respondent from offering any evidence as\nto the matters dealt with by the order. (e) Amendment. The administrative law judge may permit the respondent to\namend the answer upon good cause shown at any time before or during the\nhearing, or at any time prior to the issuance of the administrative law judge's\ndecision and recommended order, upon such terms as may be deemed just, consistent with due process. (f) Admission by failure to\nanswer. If the respondent fails to file a timely answer, the\nadministrative law judge may deem such failure to constitute an admission of\nthe material facts alleged in the charge and a waiver by the respondent of a\nhearing. (g) A public\nemployer which is made a party to an improper practice charge pursuant to\nsection 209-a.3 of the act may file responsive pleadings in accordance with\nsubdivisions (a)-(e) of this section. The administrative law judge may deem the\npublic employer's failure to file any responsive pleading to constitute a\nwaiver of the public employer's right to participate in any hearing held on the\nallegations of impropriety set forth in the charge.
