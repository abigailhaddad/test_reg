  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1727-1.4 - Additional provisions for operating projects\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After initial occupancy, applications\nwill continue to be accepted at all times unless the estimated waiting period\nis three years or more or the number of applications shall equal the number of\ndwelling units for the project, whichever basis shall result in a shorter list. During any period in which applications are being accepted, the housing company\nshall implement an ongoing affirmative fair housing marketing program to\nattract eligible applicants least likely to apply to the project. In cases\nwhere the waiting period is three years or more or reaches a number in excess\nof the number of dwelling units for the project, the housing company, with the\nwritten approval of the division, may discontinue acceptance of applications, except that such discontinuance shall not apply to eligible Vietnam veterans, their surviving spouses, project displaces, or to the mobility-impaired or\nmembers of their family who are mobility-impaired in projects having apartments\ndesigned for or modified to accommodate the mobility-impaired. The housing\ncompany must obtain the approval of the division at least 30 days in advance\nbefore it reopens applications to the public. The division will base its\napproval on a review of the housing company's compliance with this Part and the\nhousing company's submission of an affirmative fair housing marketing plan\nacceptable to the division. Such reopening of applications shall be processed\nin the same fashion as the processing of inquiries and applications, pursuant\nto sections\n1727-1.1, 1727- 1.2 and 1727-1.3 of\nthis Subpart. (b) The processing of\naccepted applications to determine eligibility should be limited to a number\nsufficient to provide an adequate number of eligible applicants in numerical\norder, to meet turnover requirements. (c) From time to time, the housing company\nshall canvass the applicants on its waiting list, in chronological order, in\nsuch manner as the housing company may deem appropriate in order to fill\nvacancies or to assess the need to reopen its waiting lists. Such canvass may\nbe either by first class mail or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The canvass shall list the current range of rents or carrying charges, by\napartment size, as well as any rent or carrying charge increases approved for\nfuture implementation. It shall further request a written statement of\ncontinued interest on the part of the applicant, as well as any changes in\naddress and state that failure to provide such statement within 21 days will be\ndeemed as noninterest on the part of the applicant. Where a housing company has\nelected to conduct the canvass of the waiting list by use of certified mail, return receipt requested, such action shall be deemed sufficient to meet the\nrequirement and intent of this section. However, where first class mail is used\nto conduct the canvass, the housing company is required to again canvass those\napplicants who failed to respond to the initial canvass by use of certified\nmail, return receipt requested. Failure by an applicant to respond to the\ncertified mail canvass will be deemed as noninterest, whereupon the application\nshall be terminated with an appropriate annotation made to the AWL (or to the\nmanual log) kept pursuant to section\n1727-1.3\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart and evidence of the canvass efforts maintained in the housing\ncompany's applicant files. (d) Upon\nthe request of an applicant, the housing company is obligated to advise said\napplicant of his or her position on the waiting list. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1727-1.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
