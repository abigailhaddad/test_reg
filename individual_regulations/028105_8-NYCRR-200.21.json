The certification of\nimpartial hearing officers is subject to suspension or revocation on the\ngrounds of incompetence or misconduct. (1)\n\nComplaints alleging the misconduct or challenging the competence of an\nimpartial hearing officer shall be made in a signed written statement to the\ncommissioner and shall contain a concise statement and documentation of the\nfacts upon which the complaint is based. (2)\n\nUpon receipt of the complaint, the\ncommissioner shall provide the impartial hearing officer with notice of the\ncomplaint and 30 days to respond thereto. (3)\n\nThe commissioner shall provide for review\nand, if warranted, further investigation of the complaint. The investigation\nprocess shall be conducted in accordance with the following: (i) A summary of the complaint shall be sent\nto the impartial hearing officer and complainant. (ii)\n\nAdditional information may be requested\nfrom the complainant, as appropriate, which may include a request for a sworn\naffidavit. (iii)\n\nThe impartial\nhearing officer shall be provided an opportunity to respond in writing and\nprovide documentation to the State Education Department. The response from the\nimpartial hearing officer must be received not later than 30 days from the date\nthe impartial hearing officer receives the complaint summary. (iv)\n\nAll relevant information shall be\nreviewed. (v) A written final\ndecision shall be sent to the impartial hearing officer and complainant that\naddresses each allegation in the complaint. (vi)\n\nIf, upon a review of the facts, the\ncommissioner finds misconduct or incompetence on the part of the impartial\nhearing officer, the commissioner may issue a warning letter to the impartial\nhearing officer containing an order for corrective action, or, depending on\nsuch factors as the level of misconduct or incompetence and the number of prior\nfindings of misconduct or incompetence against the impartial hearing officer, the certification of the impartial hearing officer may be suspended or\nrevoked. (4)\n\nIn addition\nto complaints made to the commissioner in accordance with paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, the commissioner, on his or her initiative, may suspend, revoke or\ntake such other appropriate action with respect to the certification of the\nimpartial hearing officer upon a finding that: (i) the impartial hearing officer failed to\ncomply with an order of the commissioner; (ii)\nthe impartial hearing officer failed to\nissue a decision in a timely manner where such delay was not due to extensions\ngranted at the request of either party as documented in the record; or\n(iii)\nthe State Review Officer\ndetermined that an impartial hearing officer engaged in conduct which\nconstitutes misconduct or incompetence. (5)\n\nThe commissioner, upon finding that good\ncause has been established of either misconduct or incompetence on the part of\nthe impartial hearing officer, shall revoke or suspend the certification of the\nimpartial hearing officer, except that the commissioner may, in his discretion, issue either a warning or a conditional suspension of certification pending\ncompletion of a specified course of training where the imposition of a more\nsevere penalty would not be justified.
