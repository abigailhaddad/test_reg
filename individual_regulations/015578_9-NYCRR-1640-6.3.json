  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-6.3 - Local taxes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Local taxes, other than taxes on real property. Subdivision 1 of section\n52\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law exempts a local agency from the payment of the taxes or fees\nto any subdivision of the State or to any officer or employee thereof, except\nwhere such officer or employee is personally entitled by law to such fees as\ncompensation for services rendered or performed by him in his official\ncapacity. Subdivisions of the State include counties, cities, villages, towns, and special districts, as well as departments and agencies of the State itself. Property of a local agency is, however, only partly tax exempt, as explained in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. As with State taxes, the exemption from local\ntaxes appears to be automatic and the law does not prescribe any particular\nprocedure to be followed by a local agency in connection with such exemption. Members, officers, and employees of a local agency traveling on official\nbusiness in connection with the affairs of the local agency are exempt from\npayment of the New York City tax on occupancy of hotel rooms. To obtain the\nexemption, a separate exemption certificate for each occupancy and for each\nperson registered is furnished to the hotel, upon registering. A specimen\nexemption certificate is shown as Exhibit 5 of Appendix S-6. Copies may be\nobtained from the Comptroller of the City of New York, 50 Pine Street, New\n\nYork, New York or they may be prepared by the local agency on its own\nstationery. (b) Local taxes on real\nproperty. (1)\n\nThe property of a local agency\nincluded in a project, while subject to State, county, city or village, town, school, and special district taxes, enjoys a partial exemption from such taxes. Taxes on real property are based on assessed valuations. Subdivision 4 of\nsection\n52\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law states that the property included in a project may not, in\nany event, be assessed at an amount in excess of the actual cost of the project\n(meaning development cost, to date) and further exempts from taxation that\nportion of the assessed valuation as represents an increase over the assessed\nvaluation of the real property, both land and improvements, and still retained\nas of the date of the contract for State aid. The value of the tax exemption, determined by applying the current rate of tax to the portion of the assessed\nvaluation exempt from tax, may be applied by a municipality as a credit against\nthe periodic local subsidy which the municipality is required to make to match\nthe State subsidy, in accordance with section\n73\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law. For the purpose of computing the value of the tax exemption\nsubsidy for the first year of project operations, however, project development\ncost may, under certain circumstances, be substituted for current assessed\nvaluation. It should be noted that only the assessed valuation as of the date\nof the contract for State aid is frozen by the statute. The tax rate, and hence\nthe actual amount of taxes the local agency will pay and, likewise, the value\nof the tax exemption, may vary from year to year. In some localities, situations may arise where the property of the local agency is subject to\ntaxation by several local bodies, such as a county and a town, each setting its\nown assessed valuation, independently of the others. In such event, subdivision\n4 of section 52 applies to each such assessed valuation. Where a contract for\n\nState aid has been amended, the date of the original contract governs with\nrespect to the assessed valuations of those properties authorized to be\nacquired under the original contract, whether or not all such properties were\nacquired before the contract was amended. For properties acquired under an\namendment to an original contract and not authorized to be acquired under the\noriginal contract, the assessed valuation as of the date of the amended\ncontract shall govern. Street beds do not have assessed valuation and such\nclosed streets as are included in a project and ceded to the local agency will\nnot enter the base upon which taxes are paid and the value of the tax exemption\ncredit is computed. However, the assessed valuation of land ceded by a local\nagency for new streets, street widening, parks, playgrounds and similar\npurposes should be deducted so that the local agency pays taxes and computes\nthe value of the tax exemption only on the assessed valuation as of the date of\nthe contract for State aid of the retained land and improvements. Reference\nshould be had to the application for financial assistance and to the contract\nfor State aid for possible limitations on the period of time within which the\nceding of land for new streets, etc., must take place. Local agencies must pay\ntaxes on such land while it holds it, even though the land will eventually be\nceded. Local agencies must also pay taxes on land acquired for it in the course\nof condemnation proceedings by a municipality acting as its agent in the\ninterim period between acquisition by the municipality and its transfer to the\nlocal agency. Where a local agency has cleared all or part of the land included\nin a project and finds new construction is impracticable, a municipality was\nauthorized, until July 1, 1953, to reduce the assessment to the assessed\nvaluation of the land as of the date of the contract for State aid plus the\nvalue of any improvements remaining thereon until such time as new construction\nis practicable. In this connection, local agencies should take whatever steps\nare necessary and pursue whatever remedies are available to them, as taxpayers, to secured reductions in assessed valuations on account of\ndemolition. (2)\n\nThe application for\nfinancial assistance identifies the parcels of real property to be acquired for\nproject both in the text and in an exhibit. The Public Housing Law, section\n52(4), establishes the taxable assessed value of the project site for the life\nof the project. The loan and subsidy contract provides that within 10 days\nafter its execution, the assessor shall compile and certify to the authority\nand the division a list of each parcel included in the project site and the\nassessed value thereof as of the date of the loan and subsidy contract. This\nlist should be requested by the authority at the time of delivery of an\nexecuted copy of the loan and subsidy contract to the municipality. A copy of\nthe request made by the authority shall be sent to the division. Where a\npartial taking of a tax parcel is planned, the assessors estimated assessed\nvalue of the land to be acquired shall be obtained in the same manner as\nhereinabove provided. (3)\n\nEach tax\nyear after the execution of the loan and subsidy contract, during the life of\nthe project, a qualified representative of the authority shall immediately upon\npublication of the annual tentative assessment roll as provided in the\napplicable provisions of the Real Property Tax Law review said roll to\ndetermine whether there has been compliance by the assessor with the mandate in\nthe Public Housing Law, section 52(4), regarding the taxable assessed values of\nthe real property included in the project site. The procedures to correct the\ntaxable assessed value of real property included in the project site as\noutlined in the applicable provisions of the Real Property Tax Law shall be\nimmediately taken within the statutory period when a mistake, error, discrepancy or miscalculation is revealed by a review of the tax roll. The\nstatutory period for inspection of the tax rolls is usually three weeks after\nthe tentative tax assessment rolls are open for inspection. Authority counsel\nwill be advised of the mistake, error, discrepancy or miscalculation within two\ndays after its discovery and a copy of such notice sent to the division. The\nprotest to be made in such event is provided for in the Real Property Tax law, section 512. A uthority counsel will draw and file such protest with the\nassessor of the protest, a proceeding shall be instituted as provided in the\n\nReal Property Tax Law, article 7, by authority counsel and a copy of the denial\nand the proceeding shall be forwarded to the division. (4)\n\nThe tentative tax assessment rolls are\nusually open for inspection. (i) In New York\n\nCity, February 1st. (ii)\n\nOutside\n\nNew York City, cities and towns, June 1st. (iii)\n\nVillages, February 1st or such other\ndate as the village may adopt pursuant to Village Law, section 5510. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
