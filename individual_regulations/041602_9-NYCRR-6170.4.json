  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6170.4 - Criminal justice agency responsibilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe primary agency shall be the criminal justice agency\nwhich has contact with the victim. (a) (1)\n\nFor applicable cases in which no arrest\nhas been made, the police agency having responsibility for the case shall\ngenerally be the primary agency responsible for implementation of these\nstandards. (2)\n\nFor applicable cases\nin which an arrest has been made, primary responsibility for implementation of\nthese standards shall generally remain with the police agency responsible for\nthe case until the accused is brought before a court. Subsequent to this\nappearance of the accused in court, the prosecutor's office or other criminal\njustice agency having responsibility for the case shall generally be the\nprimary agency responsible for implementation of these standards. (b) Primary agencies shall provide\ncrime victims with information explaining the victim's role in the criminal\njustice process. Crime victims shall be informed, as indicated below, of the\nstages of the criminal justice process of significance to them and the manner\nin which information about such stages can be obtained. (1)\n\nThe primary agency, as the process goes\nforward, shall be responsible for informing the crime victim of that agency's\nparticular responsibilities in the criminal justice process and how the crime\nvictim will be asked to assist the agency in discharging these\nresponsibilities. Where appropriate, this explanation shall include specific\ninformation regarding the conduct of proceedings at which the victim may be\nasked to assist, including but not limited to identification procedures, testimony and sentencing. (2)\n\nThe\nprimary agencies shall also inform crime victims of the general procedures that\nmay follow in the investigation and prosecution of the criminal case. (3)\n\nThis information may be provided orally\nor in writing, such as through the use of pamphlets. Whenever possible, information under this section should be communicated in person to the victim. This may necessitate follow-up contact with unconscious or otherwise disabled\nor disoriented victims. (4)\n\nThe\nstages of a criminal proceeding about which the crime victim may be informed, where appropriate and of significance to that victim, include, but are not\nlimited to: the arrest of an accused; identification proceedings; the initial\nappearance of an accused before a judicial officer; the release of an accused\npending judicial proceedings; mediation; preliminary hearing; grand jury\nproceedings; pre-trial hearings; disposition, including trial, dismissal, entry\nof a plea of guilty; and sentencing, including restitution. (c) Crime victims and witnesses\nshall be routinely notified of such steps as may be open to law enforcement\nofficers or district attorneys to protect victims and witnesses from\nintimidation. (1)\n\nThe primary agency shall\nprovide victims and witnesses with information regarding current laws against\nvictim/witness intimidation. This information may be provided by a prominently\ndisplayed poster. [FN*]\n(2)\n\nWhen a\nprimary agency becomes aware of circumstances reasonably indicating that a\ncrime victim or witness has been or may be subjected to tampering, physical\ninjury or threats thereof or other intimidation, as a result of his or her\ncooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution, the agency shall\nnotify the victim or witness of appropriate protective measures which are\navailable in the jurisdiction, including but not limited to: change in\ntelephone number, transportation to and from court, relocation and moving\nassistance, judicial protective orders, protective services, local programs\nproviding protective services, and the arrest and prosecution of the\noffender. (3)\n\nPrimary agencies\nshall, where appropriate, assist victims and witnesses in obtaining protective\norders and other protective services. (d) Criminal justice agencies shall make\nreasonable efforts to ensure notification of crime victims and witnesses of\njudicial proceedings relating to their case. (1)\n\nCrime victims and witnesses shall, if\npossible, be informed of judicial proceedings by criminal justice agencies\npossessing such information if the victim or witness provides the agency with a\ncurrent address and phone number. Such notification may be by mail or by\nphone. (2)\n\nJudicial proceedings\nshall include: (i) the arrest of an\naccused; (ii)\nthe initial\nappearance of an accused before a judicial officer; (iii)\nthe release of an accused pending\nfurther judicial proceedings; and\n(iv)\nproceedings in the prosecution of the\naccused, including entry of a plea of guilty, trial, sentencing, and, where a\nterm of imprisonment is imposed, specific information shall be provided\nregarding maximum and minimum terms of such imprisonment. (e) The victim of a violent felony\noffense, a felony involving physical injury to the victim, a felony involving\nproperty loss or damage in excess of $250, a felony involving attempted or\nthreatened physical injury or property loss or damage in excess of $250 or a\nfelony involving larceny against the person, should be consulted by the\ndistrict attorney in order to obtain the views of the victim regarding\ndisposition of the criminal case by dismissal, plea of guilty or trial. In such\na case in which the victim is a minor child, or in the case of a homicide, the\ndistrict attorney should consult for such purpose with the family of the\nvictim. In addition, the district attorney should consult and obtain the views\nof the victim or family of the victim, as appropriate, concerning the release\nof the defendant in the victim's case pending judicial proceedings upon an\nindictment, and concerning the availability of sentencing alternatives such as\ncommunity supervision and restitution from the defendant. The failure of the\ndistrict attorney to so obtain the views of the victim or family of the victim\nshall not be cause for delaying the proceedings against the defendant, nor\nshall it affect the validity of a conviction, judgment or order. (f) Crime victims and witnesses shall, where\npossible, be provided with a secure area, for awaiting court appearances, that\nis separate from all other witnesses. (1)\nA\nsecure waiting area shall be an area removed from, out of sight and earshot of, and protected from entry by, the defendant, his friends and family, defense\nwitnesses and other unauthorized persons. (2)\n\nThe agency prosecuting the crime shall\nmake all reasonable efforts to see that a secure waiting area is made available\nto crime victims and prosecution witnesses who are awaiting court appearances. Other criminal justice agencies having appropriate and available facilities\nshall cooperate with the agency to provide such waiting areas where possible. The agency shall also seek the assistance of any other public or private\nagencies, such as the Office of Court Administration, having appropriate and\navailable facilities. (g) In accordance with applicable law, primary agencies shall ensure the prompt return of property held for\nevidentiary purposes, unless they determine that there is a compelling law\nenforcement reason for retaining it. (1)\n\nProperty shall not include unlicensed weapons or those used to commit crimes, marihuana, controlled substances, contraband, or items the ownership or\nlegality of possession of which is disputed. (2)\n\nProperty of any victim or witness which\nis held for evidentiary purposes should be maintained in good condition. If the\nproperty is not to be returned expeditiously, criminal justice agencies shall\nmake reasonable efforts to notify the victim or witness of the retention of the\nproperty, and shall explain to the victim or witness the property's\nsignificance in the criminal prosecution and how and when the property may be\nreturned. (3)\nA compelling law\nenforcement reason shall mean that retention of the property itself is, or is\nreasonably likely to be, material to the successful conduct of an investigation\nor prosecution. (4)\n\nThe criminal\njustice agency in possession of the property shall consult with all other\nagencies which may become involved in the case before disposing of the\nproperty, and shall make reasonable efforts to identify the rightful owner of\nthe property. (5)\n\nNothing in this\nsection shall be deemed to overrule the provisions of article 450 of the Penal\n\nLaw, with respect to the disposal of stolen property or the authority of a\ncourt to order retention of the property in the furtherance of\njustice. (h) A crime\nvictim or witness who so requests shall be assisted by primary agencies in\ninforming employers that the need for victim and witness cooperation in the\nprosecution of the case may necessitate absence of that victim or witness from\nwork. In addition, a crime victim or witness who, as a direct result of a crime\nor of cooperation with law enforcement agencies or the district attorney in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of a crime, is unable to meet obligations to a\ncreditor, creditors or others, should be assisted by such agencies or the\ndistrict attorney in providing to such creditor, creditors or others accurate\ninformation about the circumstances of the crime, including the nature of any\nloss or injury suffered by the victim, or about the victim's or witness's\ncooperation, where appropriate.
