  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-5.4 - Tubular welded frame scaffolds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Bracing. (1)\n\nTubular welded frame scaffolds\nshall be properly braced by cross bracing or diagonal bracing, or both, for\nsecuring vertical members together laterally. Such braces shall be of such\nlength as will automatically square and align the vertical members of such\nscaffolds so that when erected such scaffolds are plumb, square and rigid. All\nbraces shall be securely connected. (2)\n\nEvery tubular welded frame scaffold\nerected after June 1, 1972 to a height in excess of 26 feet shall be provided\nwith continuous vertical cross-bracing on the inboard and outboard sides of the\nscaffold except as follows: (i) Vertical\ncross-bracing may be omitted at the working level of any such scaffold. Such\nvertical bracing may be omitted between alternate pairs of scaffold frames on\nthe inboard side of any such scaffold for a maximum of two working\nlevels. (ii)\n\nTower bracing may be\nused in which case each separate tower shall be provided with continuous\nvertical cross-bracing for the full height on both the inboard and outboard\nsides. The vertical cross-bracing may be omitted on the inboard side of the\nuppermost working level only. Adjacent towers of the scaffold shall be tied\ntogether on both the inboard and outboard sides by continuous horizontal\nmembers that extend the full length of the scaffold. Such horizontal members\nshall be placed at every level where building or structure tie-ins are required\nby paragraph 23-5.3(h)(1) of this Subpart. (3)\n\nDiagonal horizontal bracing shall be\nprovided at every level where building or structure tie-ins are\nrequired. (b) Scaffold\nframes. (1)\n\nCoupling pins, sprockets or other\nsafe positive couplers shall be used to connect scaffold frames at every\nvertical frame extension. (2)\n\nEach\nframe leg shall have a positive lock or fastener to hold one frame member to\nthe other vertically. (3)\n\nThe\nspacing of frame members of tubular welded frame scaffolds shall not exceed the\nfollowing limits except for special conditions where trusses or other means of\nbracing insure the required factor of safety of such scaffolds: (i) The maximum permissible frame spacing for\nheavy duty scaffolds shall be up to and including six feet. (ii)\n\nThe maximum permissible frame spacing\nfor medium duty scaffolds shall be up to and including eight feet. (iii)\n\nThe maximum permissible frame spacing\nfor light duty scaffolds shall be up to and including 10 feet. (c) Brackets. Brackets\nshall be supported by the vertical members of the scaffold frames. Brackets\nshall not be more than 30 inches in width. When a bracket is used to extend the\nwidth of the frame on any side of a scaffold normally requiring a safety\nrailing, provision shall be made in the outer end of such bracket for a safety\nrailing post. (d) Safety railing\nposts. Each safety railing post installed on a tubular welded frame scaffold\nshall fit over a coupling pin or sprocket connected to the outer end of an end\nframe leg, or shall fit into a frame leg not less than four inches. Such post\nshall be securely fastened to the end frame of the scaffold by a positive\nlocking device. (e) Metal trusses. (1)\n\nWhere metal trusses are used on any\ntubular welded frame scaffold, such trusses shall be provided with sufficient\nsupports for the platform planks between the scaffold frames. (2)\n\nAny metal truss used to span a gap in a\ntubular welded frame scaffold shall have a strength capacity sufficient to\nprovide the required factor of safety. (3)\n\nWhere trusses are used on tubular welded\nframe scaffolds erected to a height of more than 60 feet, such scaffolds shall\nbe designed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of New\n\nYork. Copies of the design drawings for any such scaffold shall be kept at the\nscaffold installation site available for examination by the\ncommissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n23-5.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
