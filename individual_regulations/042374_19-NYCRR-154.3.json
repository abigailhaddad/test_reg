Tit. 19 § 154.3 - Fee\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll requests must be accompanied by the prescribed fee at the\ntime of the submittal of the certificate or other instrument or request for\nservice. Failure to include said fee shall render the request for expedited\nhandling void. The fee for expedited handling shall be payable separately. Where a certificate or other instrument was submitted to the Division with the\nprescribed fee for expedited handling and the Division determined the\ncertificate or other instrument was not acceptable for filing, the revised\ncertificate or other instrument may be re-submitted to the Division by the\nfiler without the payment of the prescribed expedited handling fee and such\ncertificate or other instrument will be processed by the Division pursuant to\nthe original request for expedited handling, provided such certificate or other\ninstrument is re-submitted to the Division within 30 days after it was last\nmailed or otherwise returned to the filer by the Division. Each request to file\na certificate or other instrument will require a separate expedited handling\nfee. A single request which includes multiple services related to a single\nentity and no more than one request to file a certificate or other instrument\nwill require only one expedited handling fee.
