  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-9.4 - Vessel Inspections, Decontamination and Administration\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except for\nactivities exempted by this Subpart, all trailered vessels shall be inspected\nby a VIT prior to launch into the waters of the Lake George Park during the\nboating season to determine that the vessel has met the clean, drained and dry\nstandard. Trailered vessels identified by a VIT as meeting this standard shall\nreceive a VICS. (b) All vessels\ninspected pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section shall be subject to\ndecontamination if determined not to meet the cleaned, drained and dry standard\nby any VIT prior to launching into the waters of the Lake George Park during\nthe boating season. Trailered vessels decontaminated by a VIT shall receive a\nVICS. (c) Upon retrieval from the\nwaters of the Lake George Park during boating season, all trailered vessels\nmust meet the cleaned and drained standard prior to leaving a launch site. Such\nvessels may receive a VICS by an authorized launch operator to demonstrate\ncompliance with this Subpart. If intact, a VICS received from an authorized\nlaunch operator shall preclude the need for a trailered vessel to receive\ninspection by a VIT as described in subdivision (a) of this section. (d) A launch operator must register the\nlaunch site with the Commission on such form as the Commission may prescribe. Following the initial registration, launch sites must be registered annually by\nthe launch operator by May 15 of each year. This requirement shall not apply to\nany launch sites which are owned by a State or local government or which are\nstaffed by Commission personnel. (e) The Commission may enter into written\nagreements with public launch owners and operators to implement the trailered\nvessel inspection program on public launch sites. (f) All launch operators required to register\npursuant to this section shall keep true and accurate records during the\nboating season in a manner specified by the Commission showing the following: the boat registration number of each trailered vessel launched into or\nretrieved from the waters of the Lake George Park at its launch site; the VICS\ninventory maintained by the launch operator; the VICS removed by the launch\noperator prior to a trailered vessel being launched into the waters of the Lake\n\nGeorge Park; the VICS applied to a trailered vessel by a launch operator upon\nretrieval at its launch site of a trailered vessel from the waters of the Lake\n\nGeorge Park. These records shall be maintained on a daily basis and retained\nfor a minimum of three years and shall be available for inspection upon request\nby the Commission. (g) Launch\noperators shall maintain their launch sites in a manner authorized by the\n\nCommission so as to prevent trailered vessels not equipped with an intact VICS\nfrom launching into the waters of the Lake George Park. (h) All VITs will be trained and certified\nannually by the Commission. A reasonable training fee may be charged to\nindividuals taking the course. The Commission will identify the type and hours\nof training to be completed by VITs on an annual basis. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
