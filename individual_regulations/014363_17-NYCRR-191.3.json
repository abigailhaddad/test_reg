Tit. 17 § 191.3 - Types of safety hazards students may encounter while walking to and from school\n\nState Regulations\nA student may encounter three different types of potential\nhazards while walking to school: (a) Highways without sidewalks or adequate shoulders. With this type of hazard, a\nstudent must be walking either on a narrow shoulder or in the roadway. If a\nusable sidewalk exists, then the student is expected to use it unless the\nsidewalk is closed to the public by order of the local municipality. The length\nof the highway section without sidewalks where children walk on the roadway or\non a shoulder within five feet of the roadway is to be measured by any normally\naccepted method (i.e.,use a measuring wheel, measuring tape or scale the\ndistance from a map). For children to be covered by a child safety zone, they\nmust walk the complete length of the section under analysis. When evaluating a\nsubdivision or neighborhood, the district may use the closest residence to the\nschool for which all students in the neighborhood must pass as the point to\nbegin calculations. If this residence qualifies, all other residences in the\nneighborhood will also qualify. In order to determine a point value for this\ntype of hazard, the following information must be known: (1)\nfacility which the student walks on\n(i.e., sidewalk, shoulder greater than five feet wide, shoulder less than five\nfeet wide, or roadway); (2)\n15\nminute volume count on the affected roadway during the normal period when\nstudents walk to and from school; and\n(3)\nspeed limit on the affected roadway. Determine the type of facility, the volume of traffic, and\nthe speed limit using the definitions for \"Curb\", \"Narrow bridge or underpass\", \"Roadway\", \"Shoulder\", \"Sidewalk\", \"Speed limit\", and \"Volume of traffic\". Distances should be rounded to the nearest foot. On a roadway without a\nshoulder for a distance of 397 feet, one point is awarded for the first 300\nfeet and a second point is awarded for feet 301 through 600. (b) Highway intersections. With\nthis type of hazard, the student must be crossing a roadway at an intersection\nor a marked midblock pedestrian crossing. Two roadways may need to be crossed\nat an intersection. When this occurs, only the most critical roadway (highest\npoints) should be used. The roadways which the student must cross can either be\npublic or private. In the case of a private road, such as an entrance to a\nshopping center or an industrial plant, the 15-minute volume must be\nrepresentative of a 15-minute period when the student walks to or from school. Crossing a roadway is not considered a hazard due to the presence of any of the\nfollowing controls which provide pedestrian protection: (1)\nall way stop signs; (2)\nadult crossing guard; and\n(3)\npedestrian bridge or underpass within 500\nfeet of the crossing which can be utilized instead of crossing the road. Each intersection is considered a separate, distinct\nhazard. Along a given route, a student may cross four to five intersections. The intersection with the highest point value should be used in the analysis to\ndetermine if a CSZ exists because a hazardous intersection must be crossed. If\na combination of hazards is to be examined, then the two intersections which\nhave the highest individual point totals may be used. Consequently, the number\nof qualifying points is higher for multiple hazards than it is for a single\nhazard. Determine the type of control, the number of lanes of traffic on the\nroadway being crossed, the volume of traffic, and the speed limit using the\ndefinitions for \"No control\", \"Number of lanes crossed\", \"Speed limit\", \"Stop\nsign control\", \"Traffic control signals\" and \"Volume of traffic\". (c) Highway-railroad\ngrade crossings. With this type of hazard, the following information must be\nknown: (1)\nnumber of tracks in use; and\n(2)\nnumber of trains using the\ntracks during the morning and afternoon crossing periods. Determine the number of tracks and trains using the\ndefinitions for \"Number of tracks\" and \"Number of trains\". (d) ROUTES WITH HIGH DENSITY OF\nVACANT BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES. With this type of hazard, a student's route to school has a\ndensity of vacant or unoccupied structures which exceeds the municipal average\nas certified by the county, city, town, village, borough or other municipal\nentity in which the route is located. (e) ROUTES WITH HIGH INCIDENCE OF VIOLENT\nCRIME. With this type of hazard, the incidence of violent crime\noccurring at any location, intersection or address along the student's route to\nschool exceeds the statewide statistical average for violent crime incidents\nper 100,000 people as certified by the county, city, town, village, borough or\nother municipal entity in which the route is\nlocated.
