  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 167.3 - Procedure for inventorying private bridges\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe inventory procedure consists of providing the selected\nbridge information contained on the included \"Private Bridge Inventory Form.\"\nOne form should be submitted for each private bridge being inventoried. Specific instructions for filling out the form are as follows: (a) County. Enter the name of the county in\nwhich the bridge is located. (b) Political unit. Enter the name of the city, town, or village in which the\nbridge is located. (c) Location\ndescription. Record the narrative location of the bridge by referring it to a\ndistinguishable feature shown on an oil company New York State highway map. Tie\nthe bridge to the nearest town, village, hamlet, junction of numbered touring\nroutes or topographic feature shown on the map. Examples: (1)\n\nIn\n\nCity of Oneonta\n(2)\n3 miles NW of\n\nArcade\n(3)\n1 mile W. of Jct. Rts. 9\nand 22\n(d) Feature\ncarried. Record a description of the feature carried by the bridge. For bridges\ncarrying railroads record the rail line code and milepost identification if\navailable: Examples: (1)\n\nConrail, Hudson Division: line A3, MP 105.40\n(2)\n\nPedestrian Walkway\n(3)\n\nFarm Access\n(4)\n\nIndustrial Plant Service Road\n(e) Feature crossed. Record the\nprimary feature being crossed by the bridge. For bridges crossing over\nrailroads, record the rail line code and milepost identification if available. Examples: (1)\n\nMill\n\nCreek\n(2)\n\nStream (unamed)\n(3)\n\nDitch\n(4)\n\nConrail: Hudson Division, line A3, MP\n105-40\n(f) Owner. Record\nthe name of the bridge owner. If owned by a business or corporation input the\nname of the business. Example: (1)\nJ. H. Smith\n(2)\n\nEastman Kodak\n\nCompany\n(3)\nD & H RR. (4)\n\nTroy Country Club\n(5)\n\nNormanskill Farm\n(g) Owner code. Record the appropriate owner\ncode that best describes the owner. Code Type of Owner\n(1)\n\nIndividual or Multi Unit\n\nResidence\n(2)\n\nFarm\n(3)\n\nCommercial Business\n(4)\n\nIndustrial Facility\n(5)\n\nPrivate Railroad Company\n(6)\n\nPublic Railroad Authority\n(e.g. NYC Transit Auth, Long Is. RR.)\n(7)\n\nPark or recreation area\n(8)\nother\n(h) Year built. Record the year the bridge\nwas originally constructed. If unknown, record \"UNKN\". (i) Number of spans. Record the total number\nof spans the bridge contains. Include all main and approach spans in the\ntotal. (j) Total length of bridge. Record the length of bridge to the nearest foot. The total length is the\ndistance between the joints in the roadway at each abutment. The length should\nbe measured along the curb line (or face of railing). When the abutments are\nnot parallel or the bridge is on a horizontal curve, measure the arc length\nalong both curb lines and take the average. (k) Out to out width of bridge. Record the\nout to out width of the bridge to the nearest tenth of a foot. The out to out\nwidth is the distance between the extreme outsides (fascias) of the\nsuperstructure deck. Do not include railing posts mounted outside the fascias\nas part of the out to out width. For through truss and through girder type\nbridges, the out to out width shall be measured between the inside faces of the\ntrusses excluding the endpost members or the inside web faces of plate girders. For open deck type railroad bridges, the width shall be measured to the outside\nedges of the exterior deck girders or trusses. Overhanging track ties shall not\nbe included in the width. (l) General type of main span. Record the three digit code which describes the\ngeneral type of main spans in the bridge. This code consists of two parts. The\nfirst part is used to indicate the type of material and continuity of\nsuperstructure. The second part is used to indicate the structural type of the\nsuperstructure. Material and continuity codes\n(1)\n\nConcrete\n(2)\n\nConcrete Continuous\n(3)\n\nSteel\n(4)\n\nSteel Continuous\n(5)\n\nPrestress Concrete\n(6)\n\nPrestress Concrete Continuous\n(7)\n\nTimber\n(8)\n\nMasonry\n(9)\n\nAluminum, Wrought Iron or Cast\n\nIron\n(10)\n\nOther\n\nStructural codes\n\nSlab\n\nStringer/Multi-Beam or Girder\n\nGirder and Floorbeam System\n\nTee Beam\n\nBox Beam or Box Girders-Multiple\n\nBox Beam or Box Girder-Single or Spread rame\n\nOrthotropic\n\nTruss - Deck\n\nTruss - Thru\n\nArch - Deck\n\nArch - Thru\n\nSuspension\n\nStayed Girder\n\nMovable - Lift\n\nMovable - Bascule\n\nMovable - Swing\n\nTunnel\n\nCulvert\n\nNo Type is Dominant\n\nOther\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n167.3\n\nAny bridge supported by only two main girders shall be\ncoded with the last two digits being \"03\" regardless of whether a floor system\nis present. This applies to single track railroad bridges supported on two\ngirders or multiple track railroad bridges where each track is individually\nsupported by two girders. Example::A one span steel through truss bridge is coded\nas \"310\". State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
