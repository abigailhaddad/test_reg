  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 444.17 - Operating expenses-general\n\nState Regulations\n[ 3230 ]\n(a) Expenses are expired costs, that is, costs that have been used up in carrying on some activity during the accounting\nperiod and from which no future measurable benefit will be obtained. Hospital\nexpenses consist primarily of employee compensation, but substantial amounts of\nexpense are in the form of supplies used, utilities, repairs, insurance, depreciation and other items. The objective of expense accounting is to\naccumulate, on the accrual basis, complete and meaningful records of expenses. Within each cost center, the expenses are classified, according to natural\nclassification by the use of the fifth and sixth digits in the numerical coding\nsystem. (b) Hospitals are required\nto use in the required reports all revenue and expense accounts which have\ncapitalized titles and which have numerical codes with a fourth digit of zero\n(except where noted) when such a function as defined in this manual exists, even though the activity is not separately organized within the hospital. The\nonly circumstances under which the hospital need not report an existing zero\nlevel account are when the patient service provided in a Daily Hospital\n\nServices cost center is not provided in a discrete unit. (c) PATIENT SERVICE EXPENSE. This group of\naccounts (6000 - 7999) is used to report the direct expenses incurred in\nproviding nursing and other professional services (daily hospital services, ambulatory services and ancillary services) rendered to patients. For each\nnursing and other professional service revenue center account a corresponding\ncost center account is provided. The second, third and fourth digits of the\naccount numbers of the related revenue and expense cost centers are the same. Comparisons of the revenue and direct expense of each nursing and other\nprofessional service center are thereby facilitated. (d) OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE. This group of\naccounts (8000 - 8999) is used to report the direct expenses incurred by the\nresearch, education, general, fiscal and administrative cost centers, and\nvarious unassigned cost centers. When cost finding procedures are performed, the expenses charged to these centers are allocated to the various patient\nservice expense cost centers to determine the full cost of providing each\nrevenue producing service. (e) The\nfollowing pages contain detailed descriptions of the functions or types of\nactivities to be included in each cost center, the name and definition of the\napplicable standard unit of measure and the data source of the standard unit of\nmeasure. (f) STANDARD UNITS OF\nMEASURE. The Standard Unit of Measure is required to provide a uniform\nstatistic for measuring costs. The Standard Unit of Measure for revenue\nproducing cost centers (Daily Hospital, Ambulatory, and Ancillary Services)\nattempts to measure the volume of services rendered to patients (productive\noutput). For non-revenue producing cost centers, the Standard Unit of Measure\nattempts to measure the volume of support services rendered. The Standard Unit\nof Measure provides a method of determining unit cost and revenue to facilitate\ncost and revenue comparisons among peer group health facilities. Standard Units\nof Measure should not be confused with allocation statistics used to allocate\ncost of non-revenue producing cost centers to each other and to the revenue\nproducing centers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n444.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
