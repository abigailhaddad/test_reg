  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.63 - Executive Order No. 63: Creating the State Historical Records Advisory Board and the position of State Historical Records Coordinator. [*][DAGGER][DOUBLE DAGGER]\nState Regulations\n\nNew York's historical records are an invaluable cultural\nresource because of the information they provide about New York's people, institutions, communities and governments. Only through study of the records of\nthe past can we fully understand the present and plan intelligently for the\nfuture. Historians, public policy analysts, sociologists, scientists, demographers, and many other specialists draw on historical records for\nresearch. Historical records also have immediate, practical uses for\nthe citizens of New York: they document legal rights and responsibilities; they\nprovide information needed by managers of institutions, including State and\nlocal governments, to analyze program development and to ensure the continuity\nof administration; they offer essential documentation on the State's\ninfrastructure; and they contain data useful for research into current issues. The records created by our governments provide citizens with the means to\nmeasure the effectiveness and economy of programs and to ensure the\naccountability of public officials. It is appropriate that sound programs for the\nidentification, preservation, management, and use of historical records be\nencouraged by State government on behalf of all New Yorkers. In order to\nencourage, assist, and coordinate the most effective preservation and\nadministration of historical records in the State, it is necessary and\ndesirable to establish the State Historical Records Advisory Board to be\nchaired by the State Historical Records Coordinator. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby establish the New York State\n\nHistorical Records Advisory Board (\"Board\") and the position of State\n\nHistorical Records Coordinator (\"Coordinator\"). General Powers and Duties\n\nThe Board shall serve as an advisory and coordinating body\nfor planning programs and projects for the collection, description, management\nand use of historical records. Specifically, the Board shall: - develop, promulgate, and maintain on a current basis a\nstatement of goals and priorities for historical records programs in New York\n\nState; - encourage the development of coordinated documentation\nstrategies and collaborative programming to ensure systematic and\ncost-effective historical records programs; - encourage cooperation among organizations, institutions\nand groups interested in historical records programs; - encourage the development of educational and\ninformational programs to increase public awareness of the importance of\nhistorical records; - sponsor surveys and gather information on historical\nrecords and on historical records programs and repositories; - encourage broader and more varied use of historical\nrecords for the benefit of the citizens of the State; - review and evaluate applications from within the State\nfor funding under the historical records program of the National Historical\n\nPublications and Records Commission; - cooperate with other Federal or State funding agencies\nthat provide support for historical records projects; - encourage broader support of historical records programs\nby the general public and by private sector funding sources; - make recommendations for the improvement of the keeping\nof historical records throughout the State; and\n- undertake directly, when necessary and when resources are\navailable, special projects of high priority and of statewide\nsignificance. Once each year, the board shall report to the Governor on\nthe condition of historical records in the State and on progress toward the\ngoals and priorities identified by the board. Membership\n\nThe board shall consist of 13 members, exclusive of the\ncoordinator, at least a majority of whom shall have recognized experience in\nthe administration of historical records or archives, and the coordinator, who\nshall serve as chairperson. Five members shall serve for an initial term of one\nyear; four members shall serve for an initial term of two years; four members\nshall serve for an initial term of three years; and the coordinator shall serve\nfor an initial term of four years. Thereafter, all members shall serve for a\nterm of three years, except the coordinator who shall serve for a term of four\nyears. All terms shall end on the 30th day of April. The members of the board shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for travel and actual expenses from funds appropriated\nfor this purpose (through the State Archives). State Historical Records\n\nCoordinator\n\nThe State Archivist shall serve as the State Historical\n\nRecords Coordinator. The State Archives shall serve as the board's secretariat\nin supporting and carrying out its activities. The coordinator's\nresponsibilities shall include, but not be limited to, coordinating, monitoring\nand reporting on projects and activities undertaken by the board; gathering and\nassembling information for the board on other projects, programs and activities\nrelating to historical records; serving as liaison with the National Historical\n\nPublications and Records Commission, making available information on that\n\nCommission's grant program and preparing the board's recommendations on\napplications to the commission from within New York State; serving as the\nboard's liaison to State and local government agencies and officials on matters\nrelating to historical records programs; and, where appropriate, serving as\nproject director for projects administered directly by the board. Cooperation of Other State Agencies\n\nAll State agencies having custody of, or responsibility\nfor, historical records of the State, shall cooperate with, support, and\nprovide assistance to, the board and the coordinator.
