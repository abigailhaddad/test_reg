  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 148.1 - State aid for experimental programs for pre-kindergartens, experimentation and innovation in improvement of instruction and elimination of racial imbalance and improvement of integrated education\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Funds will be made available to school\ndistricts, boards of co-operative educational services, county vocational\neducation and extension boards and area centers for co-operative educational\nservices, within the limits of annual appropriations (L. 1966, ch. 46), in\npartial reimbursement for approved costs for new programs initiated in these\nareas, which costs are incurred by reason of such new or additional\nprograms. (b) Programs to be\nconsidered for such reimbursement are: (1)\npre-kindergartens for children in disadvantaged areas; (2)\nexperimentation and innovation in\nimprovement of instruction; (3)\nelimination of racial imbalance and improvement of integrated\neducation. (c) Applications for aid for such programs shall be submitted to the commissioner\nby the district or other applicant on forms prescribed by the commissioner. Such applications shall be filed by May 15 prior to the school year in which\nthe program is to be carried out. Upon application and justification and within\nthe limits of appropriations, the commissioner may accept applications\nsubsequent to such date in the year 1966. (d) The criteria for review of such\napplications shall be as follows: (1)\n\nSignificance of proposed program. (i) Will\nthe program test important proposals for improving education for all students\nof the district or districts, or for some categories of students having special\neducational needs?\n(ii)\n\nWill the\nresults of the program, if successful, show the suitability of such program for\nimprovement of educational offerings in other districts?\n(2)\n\nAdequacy of planning. (i) Does the proposal reflect knowledge of\navailable research?\n(ii)\n\nAre the\npurposes and goals clearly stated?\n(iii)\n\nAre the procedures to be followed\nclearly outlined?\n(iv)\n\nIs provision\nmade for suitable evaluation of results?\n(v) Does the plan provide for qualified\npersonnel, adequate facilities and resources to carry out the\nprogram?\n(3)\n\nEconomic\nefficiency. (i) Are anticipated expenditures\nreasonable in relation to procedures to be followed and anticipated\nresults?\n(ii)\n\nAre the proposed\nexpenditures over and above those which the district would make in its regular\ninstructional program?\n(e) The application for aid shall indicate\nthe budgeted amount of the proposed program which shall be in addition to\nexisting programs or in addition to the normal cost of instruction provided by\nthe district for children in the area covered by the experimental program. If\nsuch program is approved, the State aid shall be computed as follows: (1)\n\nIn the case of a school district, the\napproved excess costs of the program shall be multiplied by the aid ratio of\nthe district, but not less than 50 per cent. (2)\n\nIn the case of a board of co-operative\neducational services, county vocational education and extension board or an\narea center for co-operative educational services, the aid ratio shall be\ndetermined by dividing the total true valuation of taxable real property of the\nschool districts participating in the program by the total weighted average\ndaily attendance of such districts. The aid shall be the approved excess costs\nof the program multiplied by such aid ratio, but not less than 50 per cent. All\ndistricts participating in such a project must be listed by legal designation\nin the application. (3)\n\nExcept in\n(5) below, all allowances for the purchase of equipment shall be determined by\nprorating the cost on the basis of the reasonable life expectancy of the item\nand the expected period of time it will be used in the proposed experiment. The\ntotal cost of equipment must be shown in the application. (4)\n\nCapital expenditures for construction or\nmajor alterations of buildings cannot be aided. The rental of approved\ntemporary quarters may be aidable as an excess cost. (5)\n\nState aid for approved purchases of\nequipment in the first year of operation of a pre-kindergarten class shall be\nat the district's aid ratio plus 10 percentage points, but not less than 60 per\ncent. The commissioner shall determine the amount and type of pre-kindergarten\nequipment to be approved for aid. (6)\nA limited number of experimental\npre-kindergarten programs may be designated by the commissioner as\ndemonstration and in-service teacher education centers for specified regions, and in such cases the district or other applicant shall be entitled to the full\ncost of services specifically required for such regional demonstration and\nteacher education functions. (7)\n\nApproved expenditures for initial planning for a limited time may be considered\npart of the excess cost and approvable for aid. (8)\n\nThe commissioner may modify the above aid\nprovisions if in his judgment highly unusual circumstances prevail which\nwarrant such modification. (f) There shall be no duplication of aid, and\ndistricts or other applicants shall not submit costs for approval which will be\nreimbursed from Federal aid, or from other special State aid programs. If a\ndistrict is submitting or has submitted the same project for funding in whole\nor in part under a Federal program of aid; or under another special State aid\nprogram; or a private grant program, this should be noted in the plan and the\namount and source of such aid specified. Estimated excess costs must be limited\nto expenditures which would not be incurred unless the proposed experimental\nprogram were undertaken. (g) If the\nproject is approved for aid, said aid will be distributed to the district based\non the following schedule: (1)\ntwenty-five\npercent at the time of project approval; (2)\nquarterly payments as requested by local\ndistricts for projects of less than $100,000; (3)\nmonthly payments as requested by local\ndistricts for projects of more than $100,000; (4)\nbut no more than 90 percent of the total\nproject cost until after receipt and audit of the final expense report at which\ntime the balance will be paid. (h) Each district receiving State aid for an\nexperimental project shall maintain records and make a report of expenditures\nand of progress no later than July 31, following the close of the school\nyear.
