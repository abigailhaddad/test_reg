Some are common to any planning process. Others vary with the area for which\nthe plan is to be prepared. The needs of inhabitants, the region, and of\nsociety define those determinants that receive primary emphasis. The determinants used in preparing this Land Use and\n\nDevelopment Plan were chosen to identify those areas in the park best suited\nfor development. The determinants fall into the following basic categories: (1)\nnatural resources, (2)\nexisting land use patterns, and\n(3)\npublic considerations. The\ndeterminants found within these three categories help identify areas where\nsimilar standards are necessary if develop-ment is to provide positive values\nto both the park and the community in which it is located. Furthermore, they\nidentify areas where the potential costs of development to the developer, the\ncommunity, the prospective purchaser and the environment are so great that\nserious consideration should be given to alternative uses. The natural resource determinants identify those areas that are\nphysically most capable of sustaining development without significant adverse\nimpact. Such determinants as soils, topography, water, vegetation and wildlife\nhave been inventoried and analyzed to assure the protection of the basic\nelements of the park. Existing land uses must also be carefully considered in\nthe planning process, particularly because they are important determinants of\nthe park's present and future character. These determinants identify the\nhistoric patterns of the park's growth and indicate the types of growth that\nhave been and are presently viable. Future development contemplated under the\nplan must also be considered in light of its relation to existing\ndevelopment. The Legislature has found that there is a State interest in the\npreservation of the Adirondack Park, and therefore a variety of public\nconsideration determinants have been analyzed in the preparation of this plan. In general, public consideration determinants help identify areas that must be\nprotected in order to preserve the essential open space character of the park. These areas may be considered important from a public standpoint for such\nreasons as their location near important State lands or their present use in an\nopen space condition. Additionally, there may be a substantial State interest\nin preserving certain critical public considerations. The following determinants were used in the land area\nclassification process. The land use implications paragraph is a general\nindication of the manner in which these determinants were utilized in preparing\nthe plan: A. DETERMINANT: SOIL\n1. Characteristic: Poorly drained or\nseasonally wet soils. Description: Soil with a high-water content or seasonal\nhigh-water table less than 1\n1/2\nfeet from the surface. Land use implications: Onsite wastewater treatment systems will\nnot function adequately and may pollute groundwater supplies. There may also be\na problem of flooded basements, backed-up toilets, broken pavements, cracked\nwalls and similar situations. These problems may lead to community health\nhazards, environmental problems, inconvenience and economic hardship. Severe\ndevelopmental limitations exist in those areas that contain a high proportion\nof poorly drained or seasonally wet soils. Such areas are capable of sustaining\ndevelopment at only a very low level of intensity. 2. Characteristic: Moderately drained soils. Description: Soils with a seasonal high-water table 1\n1/2\nto 4\nfeet below the surface. Land use implications: A potential for onsite wastewater\ntreatment system failure or groundwater pollution exists. The New York State\n\nDepartment of Health recommends that the bottom of a onsite wastewater\ntreatment system, tile field be 18 to 30 inches below the soil surface at final\ngrade, with a minimum depth of two feet between the bottom of the tile field\nand the water table. Special precautions must also be taken to avoid washouts\nwhere deep road cuts are necessary. An occasional problem for roads, streets\nand parking lots on this soil is the \"washboard\" effect caused by frost\nheaving. Although these soils can tolerate a higher level of development than\ncan poorly drained soils, moderate development limitations still\nexist. 3. Characteristic: Well-drained soils. Description: Soils with a depth to the seasonal high-water\ntable of more than four feet. Land use implications: Areas containing well-drained soils\npresent only slight development limitations. Generally, this type of soil can\nadequately filter the effluent from onsite wastewater treatment systems and\nposes few other construction problems. 4. Characteristic: Low permeability soils. Description: Soils with a permeability rate of less than one\ninch per hour. Land use implications: Soils with low permeability\ncharacteristics present severe development problems. Onsite wastewater\ntreatment systems may overflow, causing pollution of surface water. Street, road and parking lot surfaces heave, and building walls and foundations tend to\ncrack. Sanitary landfills may cause acute problems when located on soils with\nthese characteristics. 5. Characteristic: Moderately permeable soils. Description: Soils with a permeability rate of one inch per 30\nto 60 minutes. Land use implications: Problems experienced in soils with this\ncharacteristic are similar to, but slightly less severe than, problems\nexperienced with soils of low permeability. In general, adequately designed and\nengineered onsite wastewater treatment systems, roads and structures help solve\nthe problems that these soils can cause, but these alternatives tend to be\nexpensive. Areas containing a high percentage of these soils should not be\ndeveloped at a high level of intensity. 6. Characteristic: Permeable soils. Description: Soils with a permeability rate of more than one\ninch per 30 minutes. Land use implications: Generally, these soils present only\nslight development limitations, and they can handle a relatively intense level\nof development. However, excessive permeability may create a potential for the\npollution and contamination of groundwater and nearby uncased wells if onsite\nwastewater treatment systems are employed. 7. Characteristic: Shallow depth to bedrock. Description: Soils with a depth to bedrock of less than one and\n1 % feet. Land use implications: These soils present severe development\nconstraints. Massive excavation costs are necessary to do even minimal\ndevelopment. Onsite wastewater treatment systems are not possible under these\nconditions, as soil depths are not sufficient to provide adequate filtration of\neffluent. Community sewage systems can only be installed at a prohibitive cost. Shallow soils also present substantial road and building construction problems. These soils should not be developed. 8. Characteristic: Moderate depth to bedrock. Description: Soils with a depth to bedrock of 1 I/2 to 4\nfeet. Land use implications: These soils present moderate development\nlimitations. Onsite wastewater treatment problems can arise with effluent\nflowing directly over the bedrock into nearby drainages or groundwater\nsupplies. The more shallow portions of these soils result in increased\nexcavation costs. Intense development should not occur in these\nareas. 9. Characteristic: Deep soils. Description: Soils with a depth to bedrock of more than four\nfeet. Land use implications: Relatively intense development can occur\non these soils. 10. Characteristic: Extremely stony soils. Description: Soils with over 35 percent coarse fragments less\nthan three inches in diameter. Land use implications: These soils present development\nproblems. Excavation for such purposes as onsite wastewater treatment systems, homesites with basements, and streets and roads is costly and difficult. Soils\nwith this description affect the rate at which water moves into and through the\nsoil. The difficulty of establishing a good vegetative ground cover can cause\nerosion problems. Generally, intense development should be avoided on soils of\nthis nature. B. DETERMINANT: TOPOGRAPHY\n1. Characteristic: Severe slopes. Description: Areas with slopes of over 25 percent. Land use implications: These slopes should not be developed. Development on these slopes presents serious environmental problems. Erosion\nrates are greatly accelerated. Accelerated erosion increases siltation. Septic\nsystems will not function properly on these slopes. Development costs are\nlikely to be massive because of the special engineering techniques that must be\nemployed to ward off problems such as slipping and sliding. Proper grades for\nstreets are difficult to attain and often can only be accomplished by large\nroad cuts. 2. Characteristic: Steep slopes. Description: Areas with slopes of 16 to 25 percent. Land use implications: These slopes present substantially the\nsame environmental hazards relating to erosion, sewage disposal, siltation and\nconstruction problems as are found on severe slopes. However, if rigid\nstandards are followed, some low intensity development can take place. 3. Characteristic: Low and moderate\nslopes. Description: Areas with slopes of not greater than 15\npercent. Land use implications: Such slopes can be developed at a\nrelatively intense level, so long as careful attention is given to the wide\nslope variability in this range. Construction or engineering practices that\nminimize erosion and siltation problems must be utilized on the steeper slopes\nin this range. 4. Characteristic: Unique physical features. Description: Gorges, waterfalls, formations and outcroppings of\ngeological interest. Land use implicatons: These features represent scarce\neducational, aesthetic and scientific resources. Construction can seriously\nalter their value as such, particularly where it mars the landscape or the\nformations themselves. Consequently, these areas should be developed only at\nextremely low intensities and in such a manner that the unique features are not\naltered. 5. Characteristic: High elevations. Description: Areas above 2,500 feet. Land use implications: These areas should ordinarily not be\ndeveloped. They are extremely fragile and critical watershed storage and\nretention areas that can be significantly harmed by even a very low level of\ndevelopment intensity. C. DETERMINANT: WATER\n1. Characteristic: Floodplains. Description: Periodically flooded land adjacent to a water\nbody. Land use implications: These areas should not be developed. Periodic flooding threatens the safety of residents and the destruction of\nstructures. Development that would destroy the shoreline vegetation would\nresult in serious erosion during flood stages. Onsite wastewater treatment\nsystems will not function properly and will pollute both surface and ground\nwaters. 2. Characteristic: Wild and scenic rivers. Description: Lands within one-half mile of designated wild and\nscenic rivers or of designated study rivers that presently meet the criteria\nfor eventual wild or scenic designation. Land use implications: The New York State Legislature has found\nthat these lands constitute a unique and valuable public resource. Consequesntly, these lands should not be developed in order to protect the rare\nresource of free flowing waters with essentially primitive shorelines. 3. Characteristic: Marshes. Description: Wetlands where there is found a grass-like\nvegetative cover and a free interchange of waters with adjacent bodies of\nwater. Land use implications: These areas present severe developmental\nlimitations. Continual flooding makes onsite wastewater treatment impossible\nand construction expensive. The filling of these areas will destroy the most\nproductive ecosystem in the park and will lower their water retention capacity. Therefore, these areas should not be developed. D. DETERMINANT: FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM\n1. Characteristic: Bogs. Description: Sphagnum, heath or muskeg vegetation underlaid\nwith water and containing rare plant and animal communities that are often of\nimportant scientific value. Land use implications: These areas should not be developed. They are sensitive areas whose delicate ecological balance is easily upset by\nany change in water level or the addition of any pollutants. 2. Characteristic: Alpine and subalpine life\nzones. Description: Areas generally above 4,300 feet exhibiting\ntundra-like communities. Land use implications: These areas should not be developed. The\nvegetative matter in these areas cannot withstand any form of compaction or\ndevelopment. These communities are extremely scarce in the park. 3. Characteristic: Ecotones. Description: Areas of abrupt change from one ecosystem to\nanother, giving rise to extraordinary plant and animal diversity and\nproductivity. E. DETERMINANT: VEGETATION\n1. Characteristic: Virgin forests. Description: Old-growth natural forests on highly productive\nsites, including those natural areas identified by the Society of American\n\nForesters. Land use implications: These areas deserve protection and\nshould, therefore, be developed only at a low level of intensity. Intense\ndevelopment of these areas would destroy illustrative site types, including\nvestiges of primitive Adirondack conditions deemed important from both\nscientific and aesthetic standpoints. 2. Characteristic: Rare plants. Description: Areas containing rare plant communities, including\nthose identified by the State Museum and Science Services. Land use implications: These areas should not be developed. Development, even at a very low level of intensity, would modify the habitat of\nthese plants and thereby cause their possible extinction in New York\n\nState. F. DETERMINANT: WILDLIFE\n1. Characteristic: Rare\nand endangered species habitats. Description: Habitats of species of wildlife threatened with\nextinction either in New York State or nationwide. Land use implications: These areas should not be developed. Development at even a low level of intensity would modify the habitats of these\nspecies and thereby cause their possible extinction in New York State or\nnationwide. These small areas are often the survival link for entire\nspecies. 2. Characteristic: Key wildlife habitats. Description: Important deer wintering yards, waterfowl\nproduction areas and bodies of water containing native strains of trout. Land use implications: These areas can sustain only a very\nlimited level of development intensity without having a significant adverse\naffect on the wildlife. Development at greater intensities would alter the\nhabitats, thus making them unsuitable for continued use by wildlife. Development also increases the vulnerability of these critical areas. G. DETERMINANT: PARK\nCHARACTER\n1. Characteristic: Vistas. Description: Area viewed from the 40 Adirondack Park vistas\nidentified in the State Land Master Plan. Land use implications: The intensity of development should vary\nwith the distance from the vista with the purpose of protecting the open-space\ncharacter of the scene. Development within one-quarter mile of the vista will\nhave a substantial visual impact on this character and should be avoided. Between one-quarter mile and five miles, a low intensity of development will\nnot damage the open-space appearance, whereas intense development would. Relatively intense development beyond five miles will not damage the scene so\nlong as it does not consist of large clusters of buildings or industrial\nuses. 2. Characteristic: Travel corridors. Description: Presently undeveloped areas adjacent to and within\nsight of public highways. Land use implications: Travel corridors play an important role\nin establishing the park image to the majority of park users. Unscreened\ndevelopment within these areas would be detrimental to the open-space character\nof the park. The allowable intensity of development should not be allowed to\nsubstantially alter the present character of these travel corridors. 3. Characteristic: Proximity to\n\nState land. (a) (1)\n\nDescription: Areas within sight and sound\nof, but not more than one-half mile from, intensively used portions of\nwilderness, primitive and canoe areas. (2)\n\nLand use implications: Intense\ndevelopment of these areas would threaten the public interest in and the\nintegrity and basic purposes of wilderness, primitive and canoe area\ndesignation. Consequently, these lands should be developed at only a very low\nlevel of intensity. (b) (1)\n\nDescription: Inholding surrounded by\nwilderness, primitive or canoe areas. (2)\n\nLand use implications: Development at\nmore than a very minimal level of intensity should not be allowed. The\ndevelopment of such parcels would compromise the integrity of the most fragile\nclassifications of land under the Adirondack Park State Land Master\n\nPlan. (c) (1)\n\nDescription: Inholdings of less than\n1,000 acres surrounded by wild forest lands and inaccessible by two-wheel-drive\nvehicles. (2)\n\nLand use\nimplications: These areas should not be developed at more than a very low level\nof intensity. Intense development of these areas would constitute a hazard to\nthe quality of the surrounding wild forest lands. 4. Characteristic: Proximity to\nservices. (a) (1)\n\nDescription: Areas that are remote from\nexisting communities and services. (2)\n\nLand use implications: Intense\ndevelopment of these areas would be detrimental to open-space character of the\npark. Development of such remote areas is also generally costly in terms of\nservices provided by local government. Consequently, a low level of development\nshould be permitted. (b) (1)\n\nDescription: Areas that are readily\naccessible to existing communities. (2)\n\nLand use implications: These areas can\nsustain a high level of development intensity. Local government services can be\nefficiently and economically provided in such areas. Development here will\ngenerally be of positive economic value to a community. 5. Characteristic: Historic sites. Description: Sites of historic significance from a local, park\nor national standpoint. Land use implications: Any development of the site itself or\nits immediate environs, except restoration, would destroy the site's historical\nand educational values. H. DETERMINANT: PUBLIC FACILITY\n1. Characteristic: Public sewer systems. Description: Areas served by a public sewer system. Land use implications: Development may occur in these areas in\nspite of certain resource limitations that have been overcome by public sewer\nsystems. Consequently, these areas can often be used for highly intensive\ndevelopment. 2. Characteristic: Proposed public sewer\nsystems. Description: Areas identified in a county comprehensive\nsewerage study where public sewer systems are considered feasible. Land use implications: Encouraging relatively intense\ndevelopment in these areas will often provide the necessary impetus to\nestablish the proposed systems. These systems will overcome certain health\nhazards and associated environmental problems that would otherwise be\nconsidered limiting. I. DETERMINANT: EXISTING LAND USE\n1. Characteristic: Urbanized. (a) (1)\n\nDescription: A large, varied and concentrated community with a diversity of\nhousing and services. (2)\n\nLand use\nimplications: Generally, these areas have the facilities and potential to\ndevelop as major growth and service centers. (b) (1)\n\nDescription: A small, concentrated community. (2)\n\nLand use implications: Generally, these\nareas have the potential to develop as growth centers. 2. Characteristic: Residential. Description: Areas of primarily residential development. Land use implications: The primary use of these areas should\ncontinue to be residential in nature. 3. Characteristic: Forest management. Description: Large tracts, primarily of northern hardwood or\nspruce-fir forests, under active forest management. Land use implications: These areas should be developed at only\na very minimal level of intensity. They constitute a unique natural resource. The supply of these species of trees, which are uncommon in such quantities\nelsewhere in the State, is important to insure a continuing supply of saw-logs\nand fiber for the economically vital wood-using industry of the region. 4. Characteristic: Agricultural\nlands. (a) (1)\n\nDescription: Areas under intensive\nagricultural management in which there is evidence of continuing capital\ninvestment for buildings and new equipment. (2)\n\nLand use implications: These areas are an\nimportant resource within the Adirondack Park. These areas are of economic\nimportance in some areas of the park. Consequently, these areas should only be\ndeveloped at a very minimal level of intensity. (b) (1)\n\nDescription: Areas containing less viable agricultural activities frequently\ninterspersed with other types of land uses. (2)\n\nLand use implications: These areas are\nimportant to the open space character of the park and also contain pockets of\nimportant agricultural soils. Consequently, they should be utilized for a low\nlevel of development intensity. 5. Characteristic: Industrial uses. (a) (1)\n\nDescription: Areas containing large-scale economically important industrial\nactivities, located outside of centralized communities. (2)\n\nLand use implications: These areas have\nbeen intensively used and are important to the economy of the Adirondack Park. They should remain in active industrial use. (b) (1)\n\nDescription: Proposed industrial sites identified by the State Department of\n\nCommerce or regional or local planning agencies. (2)\n\nLand use implications: Because they are\npotentially important to the economy of the Adirondack Park, industrial uses\nshould be encouraged in these areas. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
