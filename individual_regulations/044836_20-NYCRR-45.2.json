  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 45.2 - Methods of accounting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nstatute imposes a tax upon the gross income for the period specified, as\ndistinguished from a tax on receipts from sales made during the specified\nperiod, and may be construed to require a cash system of accounting and\nreporting. The accounting systems of utilities under the supervision of the\n\nState Department of Public Service are, it is understood, on the accrual basis. The State Tax Commission, therefore, will accept reports on either the cash or\nthe accrual basis, according to the usual accounting system employed, providing\nsuch accounting system correctly reflects the true gross income of the\nreporting utility. (b) A utility\nkeeping its accounts on the cash basis shall include in gross income cash\nreceived by reason of any sale made or service rendered, all amounts allowed as\ncredits against charges for sales made or services rendered, and credits\nallowed for property of any kind or nature. (c) A utility keeping its accounts on the\naccrual basis shall include in gross income all receipts accrued on its books\nfor the reporting period, but will be permitted to deduct such sums as\nrepresent, for example, uncollectible accounts, returned merchandise, etc., regardless of when the sales were made or services rendered, thus achieving\nsubstantially, if not exactly, the same results as would be attained by the\ncash system of accounting and reporting. If a utility, as an established\npractice, has made periodic charges to provide for uncollectible accounts, that\npractice may be continued, provided the charges are reasonable. In such event, a utility may not deduct an additional amount for uncollectible\nitems. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n45.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
