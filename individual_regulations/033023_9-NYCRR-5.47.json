  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5.47 - Executive order no. 47: destruction of surplus state firearms\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, public safety and trust demand that State-owned\nfirearms be disposed of with the utmost care and concern for the safety and\nwelfare of the citizens of New York State; WHEREAS, under current practice surplus or used State\nfirearms commonly are traded in as part payment for new firearms\npurchases; WHEREAS, because this practice results in the return of\nthese weapons to the commercial gun market, it creates an unacceptable risk\nthat they may be possessed and used unlawfully; WHEREAS, the small fiscal savings that result from this\npractice are far outweighed by the need to ensure that firearms previously\nowned by the State never be turned against the very citizens for whose\nprotection they had been acquired; NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby order that: 1. State agencies shall not dispose of\nunneeded, used or surplus firearms through trades in exchange for new State\nfirearms. 2. At least once each\nyear and as frequently as practicable, all such firearms shall be transferred\nto the Division of State Police and shall be promptly destroyed or otherwise\nrendered permanently inoperative. 3. The Superintendent of State Police shall\ndevelop and implement policies and procedures consistent with law for the\nreceipt, handling and destruction of these weapons. Signed: George E. PatakiDated: December 16, 1996\n[FN*] [Revoked by Executive Order No. 9 (David A. Paterson), infra.]\n[Revoked by Executive Order No. 2 (Andrew M. Cuomo), infra.]\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
