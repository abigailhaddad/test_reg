Tit. 16 § 1001.19 - Exhibit 19: noise and vibration\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 19 shall contain: A study of the noise impacts of the construction and\noperation of the facility, related facilities and ancillary equipment. The name\nand qualifications to perform such analyses of the preparer of the study shall\nbe stated. If the results of the study are certified in any manner by a member\nof a relevant professional society, the details of such certification shall be\nstated. If any noise assessment methodology standards are applied in the\npreparation of the study, an identification and description of such standards\nshall be stated. The study shall include: (a) A map of the study area showing the\nlocation of sensitive sound receptors in relation to the facility, related\nfacilities and ancillary equipment (including any related substations). The\nsensitive sound receptors shown shall including residences, outdoor public\nfacilities and areas, hospitals, schools and other noise-sensitive\nreceptors. (b) An evaluation of\nambient pre-construction baseline noise conditions, including A-weighted/dBA\nsound levels, prominent discrete (pure) tones, at representative potentially\nimpacted noise receptors, using actual measurement data recorded in winter and\nsummer and during day and night as a function of time and frequency using a\nsuitable and suitably calibrated sound level meter (SLM) and octave band\nfrequency spectrum analyzer, or similar equipment. The ambient pre-construction\nbaseline sound level should be filtered to exclude seasonal and intermittent\nnoise. (c) An evaluation of future\nnoise levels during construction of the facility and related facilities\nincluding predicted A-weighted/dBA sound levels at potentially impacted and\nrepresentative noise receptors, using computer noise modeling. (d) An estimate of the noise level to be\nproduced by operation of the facility, related facilities and ancillary\nequipment assuming wind-induced background noise or stable atmospheric\nconditions, as appropriate, and not assuming any attenuation of sound that\ntransiently occurs due to weather or temperature. (e) An evaluation of future noise levels\nduring operation of the facility, related facilities and ancillary equipment\nincluding predicted A- weighted/dBA sound levels,, prominent discrete (pure)\ntones, and amplitude modulated sound, at potentially impacted and\nrepresentative noise receptors, using computer noise modeling, and an analysis\nof whether the facility will produce significant levels of low frequency noise\nor infrasound. (f) A statement in\ntabular form of the A-weighted/dBA sound levels indicated by measurements and\ncomputer noise modeling at the representative external property boundary lines\nof the facility and related facilities and ancillary equipment sites, and at\nthe representative nearest and average noise receptors, for the following\nscenarios: (1)\n\nDaytime ambient noise level - a\nsingle value of sound level equivalent to the level of sound exceeded for 90\npercent of the time during the daytime hours (7 am - 10 pm) of a year\n(L\n90\n). (2)\n\nSummer nightime ambient noise level - a single value of sound level equivalent\nto the level of sound exceeded for 90 percent of the time during the nightime\nhours (10 pm - 7 am) during the summer (L\n90\n). (3)\n\nWinter nightime ambient noise level - a\nsingle value of sound level equivalent to the level of sound exceeded for 90\npercent of the time during the nightime hours (10 pm - 7 am) during the winter\n(L\n90\n). (4)\n\nWorst case future noise level during the daytime period - the daytime ambient\nnoise level (L\n90\n), plus the noise level from the\nproposed new sources modeled as a single value of sound level equivalent to the\nlevel of sound exceeded for 10 percent of the time by such sources under normal\noperating conditions by such sources in a year\n(L\n10\n). (5)\n\nWorst case future noise level during the summer nightime period - the summer\nnightime ambient noise level (L\n90\n), plus the noise level\nfrom the proposed new sources modeled as a single value of sound level\nequivalent to the level of sound exceeded for 10 percent of the time by such\nsources under normal operating conditions by such sources in a year\n(L\n10\n). (6)\n\nWorst case future noise level during the winter nightime period - the winter\nnightime ambient noise level (L\n90\n), plus the noise level\nfrom the proposed new sources modeled as a single value of sound level\nequivalent to the level of sound exceeded for 10 percent of the time by such\nsources under normal operating conditions by such sources in a year\n(L\n10\n). (7)\n\nDaytime ambient average noise level - a single value of sound level equivalent\nto the energy-average ambient sound levels (Leq) during daytime hours (7 am -10\npm).

(9)\n\nTypical future noise level during the\ndaytime period - the energy- average ambient sound level during daytime hours\n(Leq), plus the noise level from the proposed new sources modeled as a single\nvalue of sound level equivalent to the level of the sound exceeded 50 percent\nof the time by such sources under normal operating conditions by such sources\nin a year (L\n50\n). (g) A description of the noise standards\napplicable to the facility, including any local requirements, and noise design\ngoals for the facility at representative potentially impacted noise receptors, including residences, outdoor public facilities and areas, hospitals, schools, other noise- sensitive receptors, and at representative external property\nboundary lines of the facility and related facilities and ancillary equipment\nsites. (h) A tabular comparison of\nthe noise standards applicable to the facility, including any local\nrequirements, and noise design goals for the facility, and the degree of\ncompliance indicated by computer noise modeling at the representative external\nproperty boundary lines of the facility and related facilities and ancillary\nequipment sites, and at the representative nearest and average noise\nreceptors. (i) An identification\nand evaluation of reasonable noise abatement measures for construction\nactivities, including a description of a complaint- handling procedure that\nshall be provided during the construction period. (j) An identification and evaluation of\nreasonable noise abatement measures for the final design and operation of the\nfacility including the use of alternative technologies, alternative designs, and alternative facility arrangements. (k) An evaluation of the following potential\ncommunity noise impacts: hearing damage (as addressed by applicable\noccupational safety and health administration standards); indoor and outdoor\nspeech interference; interference in the use of outdoor public facilities and\nareas; community complaint potential; the potential for structural damage; and\nthe potential for interference with technological, industrial or medical\nactivities that are sensitive to vibration or infrasound.
