Tit. 12 § 38.32 - Procedures for picking up, receiving, and opening packages\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each licensee who expects to receive a\npackage containing quantities of radioactive material in excess of the\napplicable A\n1\nor A\n2\nvalue\nspecified in Appendix A-12, Table 1 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule), shall\nmake arrangements to: (1)\nreceive the package\nwhen the carrier offers it for delivery; or\n(2)\nreceive notification of the arrival of\nthe package at the carrier's terminal and to pick up the package\nexpeditiously. (b) Each\nlicensee, upon receipt of a package containing radioactive material in\nquantities described in subdivision (a) of this section, or any package that\nshows evidence of damage or leakage shall monitor the external surfaces of the\npackage for radioactive contamination and radiation levels. The licensee shall\nperform the monitoring as soon as practical after receipt of the package, but\nnot later than three hours after the package is received during the licensee's\nnormal working hours, or not later than three hours from the beginning of the\nnext working day if it is received after working hours. (c) Upon receipt of a package marked as\ncontaining radioactive material, and in a quantity equal to or less than the\napplicable A\n1\nor A\n2\nquantity, each licensee shall: (1)\nsurvey each package\nfor radiation levels; and\n(2)\nmonitor the package surface for radioactive contamination, unless the shipper\nof the package provides documentation of monitoring for radioactive\ncontamination immediately prior to shipment demonstrating the absence of\ncontamination. (3)\nthe licensee\nshall perform the monitoring required by this subdivision as soon as practical\nafter receipt of the package, but not later than three hours after the package\nis received during normal working hours, or not later than three hours from the\nbeginning of the next working day if it is received after working\nhours.

Notification to the commissioner shall be made by telephone\nas well as by telegram, mailgram or facsimile. (1)\n(i) Removable radioactive contamination in excess of 10 picocuries (22 dpm, or 370\nmBq) per square centimeter on the external surfaces of the package for\nbeta/gamma emitters, radionuclides with half lives less than 10 days, natural\nuranium and thorium, U-235, U-238, Th-232, or Th-228 and Th-230 in ores; and\none picocurie (2.2 dpm, or 37 mBq) per square centimeter for all other alpha\nemitting radionuclides; all such contamination is to be averaged over 300\nsquare centimeters; (ii)\n\nFor\nexclusive use shipments, removable contamination in excess of ten times the\nlimit specified in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (2)\n(i) Radiation levels at one meter from the external surface of the package in\nexcess of 10 millirem (0.1 mSv) per hour, or radiation levels at the surface of\nthe package in excess of 200 millirem (2 mSv) per hour; (ii)\n\nFor exclusive use shipments, a radiation\nlevel in excess of 1000 millirem (10 mSv) per hour at the package\nsurface. (e) Each licensee shall: (1)\nestablish and\nmaintain written procedures for the safe opening of packages in which\nradioactive material is received that include consideration given to special\ninstructions for the type of package being opened; and\n(2)\nensure that the procedures are\nfollowed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n38.32\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
