Click\nto view image\n(b) From 2081, Contraband Test\n\nProcedure. Click\nto view image\n(c) NIK® System, statement of\nprincipals, procedures and tests. NIK® Public Safety developed the NIK® System of\n\nNarcotics Identification as a means of rapidly screening and presumptively\nidentifying substances suspected of being abused drugs, narcotics and\nhallucinogens. Designed to be a completely self-contained system, the kit in\nits several configurations, provides all necessary elements to perform chemical\ncolor tests for the commonly known and most frequently abused narcotics and\ndangerous drugs. Each test pack contains the chemical required to perform the\ndesired test in pre-filled, hermetically sealed glass ampoules. This eliminates\nthe need for measuring, mixing and dispensing of reagents while affording a\nmaximum of protection to the investigator. Reagent shelf life is also\nsubstantially prolonged by this method of packaging. Chemicals used are ACS\ngrade or better, providing the highest rate of accuracy. The NIK® System is designed to function as a\ntransportable-mininarcotics identification laboratory. It may be carried with\nyou and it therefore, available for use whenever and whenever the need may\narise. \"COLORMETRIC CHEMICAL TESTING\"\nThe NIK® System employs chemical colormetric comparison\nas the means by which narcotics and other controlled substances are screened\nand presumptively identified. Each test pack contains one or more chemical\nreagents which will predictably develop a color or a series of colors in the\npresence of the most commonly known narcotics and dangerous drugs. When the\npredicted color reaction occurs while following the recommended test sequence. a positive identification is presumed. A positive identification is considered\na component of probable cause and generally recognized within our legal system\nas being presumptive in nature. \"NIK® POLYTESTING SYSTEM\"\nThe NIK® System of Narcotics Identification is based upon\na poly testing procedure whereby a suspect material is subjected to a series of\nprogressively discriminating screening tests. The results of a single test may\nor may not yield a valid result. However, the sequential results of several\ntests, if they all indicate a positive reaction for a particular substance, provides a high degree of certainty that the suspect material is in fact what\nthe NIK® Poly testing System indicates it to be. Experiments have been and continue to be conducted with\nhundreds of licit and illicit chemical compounds in a continuing effort to\neliminate false positive results. No chemical reagent system, adaptable to\nfield use exists, that will completely eliminate the occurrence of an\noccasional invalid test result. A complete forensic laboratory would be\nrequired to qualitatively identify an unknown suspect substance. In absence of\nsuch a laboratory facility, the NIK® System, utilizing the recommended Poly\ntesting procedure, is your best assurance that the presumptive results of a\npositive identification are what they appear to be. \"NIK® TESTING CAPABILITY\"\nThe NIK® System will presumptively identify most\nsubstances which fall within the following general groups of abused\ndrugs: A.

SIRCHIE NARK® II SYSTEM OF NARCOTICS\nIDENTIFICATION\nSirchie's NARK® II Progressive System for Drug\n\nIdentification has the capability of presumptively identifying several families\nof substances suspected of being abused drugs. Designed to function as a\ntransportable narcotics laboratory, it is available for use wherever the need\nfor its capability might arise. Each of the tests is comprised of one or more\nchemical reagents based on National Institute of Justice Standard 0604.01\nand/or UN Standard ST/NR/13RE V1. When a predictable color or series of colors\noccur within a specific testing sequence, a positive identification may be\npresumed. COLORIMETRIC CHEMICAL TESTING\nThe NARK® II System employs chemical colorimetric\ncomparison as the means by which narcotics and other controlled substances are\nscreened and presumptively identified. Each test pack contains one or more\nchemical reagents which will predictably develop a color or a series of colors\nin the presence of the most commonly known narcotics and dangerous drugs. When\nthe predicted color reaction occurs while following the recommended test\nsequence, a positive identification is presumed. A positive identification is\nconsidered a component of probable cause and generally recognized within our\nlegal system as being presumptive in nature. Interpretation of Generated Colors\n\nFor purposes of colorimetric confirmation, it is not required\nthat you obtain an exact color match. Your colors, however, must fall within a\ngeneral area of the targeted family of color(s) referenced for that particular\nsubstance. Continue to keep in mind three important factors when reviewing your\ngenerated colors: (1)\n\nThe basic color\nor lack of color. (2)\n\nAny color\nshift or change: e.g., orange to brown. (3)\n\nThe location of colors within the test\npouch. NARK® II POLYTESTING SYSTEM\nThe NARK® II System of Narcotics Identification is based\nupon a poly testing procedure whereby a suspect material is subjected to a\nseries of progressively discriminating screening tests. The results of a single\ntest may or may not yield a valid result. However, the sequential results of\nseveral tests, if they all indicate a positive reaction for a particular\nsubstance, provides a high degree of certainty that the suspect material is in\nfact what the NARK® II testing indicates it to be. Experiments have been\nand continue to be conducted with hundreds of licit and illicit chemical\ncompounds in a continuing effort to eliminate false positive results. No\nchemical reagent system, adaptable to field use exists, that will completely\neliminate the occurrence of an occasional invalid test result. A complete\nforensic laboratory would be required to qualitatively identify an unknown\nsuspect substance. In absence of such a laboratory facility, the NARK® II\ntesting, utilizing the recommended procedure, is your best assurance that the\npresumptive results of a positive identification are what they appear to\nbe. NARK® II TESTING CAPABILITY\nNARK® II provides for presumptive identification of the\nfollowing groups of drugs: A. Cannabis Sativa L. B. Hallucinogens\nC. Stimulants\nD. Depressants\nE. Narcotics\n\nMaterial or Substance Classification\n\nHard Materials or Tablets\n\nIf unidentifiable, crush into powder form and begin\ntesting with NARK2001 Marquis Reagent\n\nCapsules\n\nIf unidentifiable, carefully remove a portion of powder\nfrom the capsule and begin testing with NARK2001 Marquis Reagent\n\nPowders\n\nBegin with NARK2001 Marquis Reagent\n\nPlant Material\n\nUse several at least 1/4\" long particles and place\ninto NARK2005 Duquenois-Levine or NARK20023 Synthetic Cannabinoid Reagent\n\nBrown or Black Tar Heroin\n\nPlace into NARK20011 Mecke's Modified Reagent a size\nsimilar to the top of a pinhead\n\nBuprenorphine\n\nPlace a size similar to the top of a pinhead, into\nNARK20010 Special Opiates Reagent, confirm with NARK20011 Mecke's Modified\n\nReagent. Liquid Samples should not be placed directly into the test\npouch. Instead, wet a piece of sterile paper approximately 1/2\" x\n1/2\" or sterile swab, with two or three drops of the suspect liquid, permit the paper or swab to briefly air dry and then insert the paper or swab\ninto the pouch. A sterile swab is ideal for this transfer. Storage\n\nIdeally field tests should be stored at room temperature\n(70°F +/- 10° or 21°C +/- 3°). NEVER allow these tests to be\nexposed to direct ultraviolet rays (either direct sunlight or fluorescent\nlighting). Examples of incorrect storage; desk tops, window sills, vehicle\nseats and the front and back decks of vehicles. If tests are frozen, DO NOT\nUSE, dispose and replace. Note: If tests are cold, the color reactions will\nappear slower. If tests are hot, the color reactions will appear faster than\nlisted.
