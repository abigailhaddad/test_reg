(5)\n\nUnless the fee is waived by the provider, if the individual does not obtain full Medicaid coverage by the payment start\ndate, or if the individual loses full Medicaid coverage on or after the payment\nstart date, the individual and/or liable parties must either: (i) pay for the preexisting services\ndelivered on or after the payment start date in accordance with the applicable\nfee schedule in section\n635-12.9\nof this Subpart; or\n(ii)\npay for the preexisting\nservices delivered on or after the payment start date with the reduced fees\nestablished by the provider.
