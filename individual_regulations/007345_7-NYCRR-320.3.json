The unit is designed to\nmeet the therapeutic needs of seriously mentally ill incarcerated individuals, while maintaining adequate safety and security on the unit. Although a BHU is\nnot operated as a disciplinary housing unit, in light of the security concerns\nassociated with the behaviors that resulted in their confinement and other\nsanctions, incarcerated individuals that pose a significant or unreasonable\nrisk to the safety of incarcerated persons, staff or the facility may be\nsubject to limitations on the quantity and type of property they are permitted\nto have, in order to maintain security and order on the unit.
