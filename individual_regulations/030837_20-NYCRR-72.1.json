  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 72.1 - Licensing of wholesale dealers of cigarettes\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 475 and 480\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, upon application, may license a person to\nbe a wholesale dealer of cigarettes as defined in section\n70.2\n(h)(2)\nof this Title. No person shall sell cigarettes in New York State for purposes\nof resale nor own, operate or maintain one or more cigarette vending machines\nin, at or upon any New York premises owned or occupied by someone else, unless\nsuch person has been granted and publicly displays, in such person's place of\nbusiness, a license as a wholesale dealer of cigarettes or unless otherwise\nprovided for in this Title. Further, no cigarette agent shall sell cigarettes\nto an unlicensed wholesale dealer, or to a wholesale dealer whose license has\nbeen cancelled or suspended pursuant to section\n72.3\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe license\ngranted to a wholesale dealer by the department is personal to the person to\nwhom it is granted and such license is not assignable. Except as provided\nherein, a license as a wholesale dealer shall continue in effect until\ncancelled or suspended by the department or until surrendered by the\nlicensee. (3)\n\nNothing in this\nsubdivision, nor Title, shall be construed to require licensing in any\ncircumstance in which the State is without power to do so by reason of the\n\nUnited States Constitution or any laws enacted pursuant thereto. Furthermore, in isolated circumstances, in which the State has the power to require\nlicensing, the department may allow a person to act in the capacity of a\nwholesale dealer without obtaining a wholesale dealer's license for an\nexclusive purpose which is not in the usual course of such person's business. A\nperson who wishes to act in such capacity must receive the advanced written\napproval of the department or must act under order or direction of a\ncourt. (b) (1)\n\nAn application for a license as a\nwholesale dealer of cigarettes must be made on a form prescribed by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance for such purpose and must fully disclose all\nof the information requested therein. Such application must be accompanied by a\nnonrefundable $1,500 fee for filing the application in the form of a bank\ncheck, certified check (or other guaranteed draft acceptable to the department)\nor money order, made payable to the Department of Taxation and Finance, unless\nsuch fee has been paid during the preceding 12 months, in which case, the fee\nfor a new license shall be $1,000. There will be no fee, however, for the\nfiling of an application for a license as a wholesale dealer where such\napplication is based solely upon the ownership, operation or maintenance of one\nor more cigarette vending machines in, at or upon premises owned or occupied by\nanother person. (2)\n\nThe department\nwill review the information submitted by the applicant and may for cause refuse\nto license such applicant in accordance with section\n72.2\nof this\n\nPart. Upon approval of an application for a license as a wholesale dealer, the\ndepartment will issue, for prominent public display, an individual certificate\nof license for each of a wholesale dealer's places of business for such\nwholesale trade, other than individual vending machines, from which the\nwholesale dealer will be authorized to sell cigarettes. Each certificate shall\nbear the address of the appropriate place of business, if applicable, and a\ncommon wholesale dealer identification number. Each certificate shall also\nindicate whether or not the licensee qualifies as a cigarette marketing\nstandards wholesale dealer as defined in article 20-A of the Tax Law. Failure\nto display such certificate(s) will constitute a violation of article 20 of the\n\nTax Law. See Part 73 of this Title for retail dealers and vending machine\nregistrations and section\n75.2\nof this Title for vending machine identification. (3)\n\nThe department, in order to protect the\n\nState's cigarette tax revenue and to insure compliance with the cigarette\nmarketing standards contained in article 20-A of the Tax Law, may periodically\nreview the status of a licensed wholesale dealer and may, at any time, require\na wholesale dealer to submit to the department any information necessary for\nthe completion of such review. (4)\n\nNot more often than once every three years, the department (in order to\nproperly administer the cigarette tax imposed by article 20 of the Tax Law or\nthe Cigarette Marketing Standards Act contained in article 20-A of such law)\nmay require every licensed wholesale dealer to file a new application for a\nlicense, again comply with, or prove its compliance with, all of the\nrequirements of the Tax Law and this Title in relation to wholesale dealers and\nto surrender its existing license. The provisions of section\n71.8\nof this Title apply to the provisions of this paragraph in the same manner and\nwith the same force and affect as if the language had been incorporated in full\ninto this paragraph and had expressly referred to the wholesale dealer's\nlicense under this Part. The department may, in its discretion, relicense\nwholesale dealers and cigarette agents concurrently. (c) (1)\nA\nwholesale dealer of cigarettes must immediately inform the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, in writing, of any change to the information shown on the\napplication for a license as a wholesale dealer or as last reported to the\ndepartment, including but not limited to, any change of name or any change in\nsuch dealer's officers, directors or partners or such persons' addresses. However, any change of location of the wholesale dealer, including any\nadditions or deletions of individual places of business, must be reported to\nthe department, in writing, prior to such change. (2)\n\nWhen shares of stock in a corporation\nwhich is a wholesale dealer are acquired by any person, such that (i) a\nwholesale dealer which had four or fewer shareholders owning, directly or\nindirectly, the voting stock of such dealer upon such acquisition has more than\nfour shareholders so owning such stock, or (ii) a person not previously owning, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the number of shares of voting\nstock of the wholesale dealer upon such acquisition owns, directly or\nindirectly, more than 10 percent of such stock, the wholesale dealer must\nimmediately file a notification of such acquisition with the\ndepartment. (d) (1)\nA license as a wholesale dealer of\ncigarettes is not assignable. That is, such license shall not be transferred to\nany person. In addition to any other meaning, a license shall be deemed\nassigned, if any change in partnership interest has occurred or if shares of\nstock of a corporate wholesale dealer are acquired by any person such that the\nperson owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent (25 percent or more\nin the case of a wholesale dealer which has four or fewer shareholders) of the\nnumber of shares of voting stock of such wholesale dealer. Except as provided\nherein, an assignment of a license is invalid and shall immediately result in\nthe cancellation of such license. (2)\n\nThe assignment of a license as a\nwholesale dealer occasioned by way of bequest or inheritance from a decedent\ndirectly to: (i) an ancestor of the\ndecedent; (ii)\nthe spouse of the\ndecedent; (iii)\na lineal descendent\nof the decedent, of the decedent's spouse. or of a parent of the decedent; or\n(iv)\nthe spouse of any lineal\ndescendant described in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph; will not, of itself, be considered a transfer of license\nwhich will operate as grounds to immediately cancel such license provided the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance is promptly notified. However, such\nassignment by bequest or inheritance shall cause cancellation of the license 90\ndays after the death of the decedent. (e) (1)\nA\nlicense as a wholesale dealer of cigarettes granted pursuant to article 20 of\nthe Tax Law and this Part does not necessarily qualify a person as a wholesale\ndealer for purposes of the cigarette marketing standards contained in article\n20-A of the Tax Law and as defined therein (see Article 2 of this\n\nSubchapter). (2)\n\nWhere a wholesale\ndealer of cigarettes wishes to purchase and affix cigarette stamps and possess\nunstamped packages of cigarettes, such dealer must also obtain a license as a\ncigarette agent pursuant to Part 71 of this Title unless otherwise specifically\nprovided for herein. Both the application for a license as a wholesale dealer\nof cigarettes and the application for a license as a cigarette agent are\nsubject to individual application filing fees. (3)\n\nWhere a wholesale dealer of cigarettes is\nalso a retail dealer of cigarettes or a cigarette vending machine\nowner/operator, such wholesale dealer must also comply with the registration\nprovisions of Part 73 of this Title. (4)\n\nExcept as provided in this Title, where a\nwholesale dealer of cigarettes is also a distributor, wholesale dealer or\nretail dealer of tobacco products, other than cigarettes, or an owner/operator\nof a vending machine through which such tobacco products are sold, a separate\nappointment, license and/or registration, as the case may be, must be obtained\n(see Article 3 of this Subchapter). (5)\nA license as a wholesale dealer issued by\nthe New York State Department of Taxation and Finance shall not constitute a\nlicense as a wholesale dealer for the City of New York. Persons wishing to\nengage in business as a New York City wholesale dealer must be licensed\npursuant to chapter 13 of title 11 of the Administrative Code of the City of\n\nNew York. Notes\nN.Y.
