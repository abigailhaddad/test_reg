  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 226.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following definitions shall apply wherever the defined\nterms are used in Parts 226, 227, and 228 of this Title: (a) Accessory. Any meter reading device, which is mechanically attached to a meter and could affect its accuracy, used\nto display or transmit meter information to a remote location or any associated\nmeter correction device, either remote or attached, used to adjust the reading\nof a meter index. (b) Bell prover. A test-standard using a calibrated cylindrical container or bell in which a\nquantity of air is collected using oil as a sealing medium. The bell prover is\nconnected to a meter under test and the quantity of air that passes through the\nmeter, as measured by the meter, is compared with the change in the quantity of\nair within the bell to determine the meter's accuracy. (c) Certification. The verification of a\ntest-standard's accuracy by this commission, by its designee, or by commission\napproved procedures, conducted with standards or equipment that trace their\naccuracy to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. (d) Correction device. An accessory used to\nadjust the measured volume to a volume at standard conditions. (e) Cubic foot bottle. A specially\nconstructed and calibrated bottle that can measure exactly one cubic foot of\nair. The calibration of the bottle is certified by the National Institute of\n\nStandards and Technology. (f) (1)\n\nCubic foot, metered. The quantity of gas\nthat occupies one cubic foot when under pressure and temperature conditions\nexisting in the meter. (2)\n\nCubic\nfoot, standard. The quantity of gas that under a pressure of 14.73 pounds per\nsquare inch absolute and at a temperature of 60° F occupies a volume of one\ncubic foot. (g) Differential test. A comparison of the difference in pressure readings between\nthe inlet and outlet of a rotary meter at a gas flow rate within the meter's\nrated capacity range, with those supplied by the manufacturer or taken at\ninstallation. (h) Fixed pressure\nfactor measurement. A correction method system, used only in conjunction with\npressure regulated installations, that employs a billing multiplier to adjust\nthe measured volume of gas delivered to standard pressure conditions. (i) Flow rate tests. (1)\n\nCheck-rate test. A meter test conducted\nwith a flow rate at the lower end of the meter's rated capacity\nrange. (2)\n\nOpen-rate test. A meter\ntest conducted with a flow rate at the higher end of the meter's rated capacity\nrange. (j) Gas meter. Any device used to measure the units of gas passing through it. (1)\n\nDomestic meter. A gas meter with a rated\ncapacity of 500 CFH or less. (2)\n\nLarge volume meter. A gas meter with a rated capacity over 500 CFH. (k) Meter accuracy. The degree to\nwhich a meter correctly measures the units of gas passing through it, determined by comparing the registration on the meter with that registered by a\ntest-standard. (1)\n\nPercent proof. The volume\nindicated by the test-standard divided by the volume indicated by the meter x\n100. (2)\n\nPercent accuracy. The\nvolume indicated by the meter divided by the volume indicated by the\ntest-standard x 100. (l) Meter class. A designation for different ranges of meter rated\ncapacities. (m) Meter index. The\nmeter mechanism that displays the quantity of gas that has been delivered\nthrough the meter. (n) Meter tests. (1)\n\nIn-test. A test of a meter made soon\nafter its removal from a customer's premises or at said premises and prior to\nany disassembly or adjustment. (2)\n\nOut-test. A test of a meter made prior to its use at a customer's\npremises. (o) Non-working reference standard. A certified reference meter or other device\nused to check the accuracy of a test-standard. (p) Prover. A type of test-standard for\nmeasuring the accuracy of gas meters. (q) Rangeability. The manufacturer's stated\nratio of maximum flow rate to minimum flow rate for a given meter. (r) Rated capacity. (1)\n\nDiaphragm type meters. The rated capacity\nof a diaphragm type gas meter is the approximate number of cubic feet per hour\nof 0.60 specific gravity gas (air = 1.00), at standard conditions, that the\nmeter is designed to pass when the average differential pressure between the\ninlet and outlet of the meter is 0.5 inch of water column. (2)\n\nOther types of meters. The rated capacity\nof other types of gas meters will be the nameplate capacity specified for that\nparticular type of meter or as otherwise specified in the commission's order\napproving it. (s) Sampling. A statistically valid method of obtaining a representative quantity\nof meters from a homogenous lot or group. (t) Sonic nozzle prover. A test-standard for\ntesting gas meters using nozzles calibrated to indicate the time required for\nthe passage of one cubic foot of air at their corresponding sonic flow rates. The sonic nozzle prover is connected to the meter under test. The time\nnecessary to pass a given number of cubic feet on the meter is compared with\nthe time indicated on the nozzle. (u) Supercompressibility. Deviation of a gas\nfrom the ideal gas laws. (v) Standard conditions. The standard base conditions of pressure and temperature\nto which natural gas volumes are referenced. (w) Strapping. A method of checking a bell\nprover by determining the relations between displaced volume and linear\nmovement of a bell prover by means of measuring scale length, bell\ncircumference, and displacement. The calibration of all measuring equipment\nused to take these measurements must be traceable to the National Institute of\n\nStandards and Technology. (x) Test-standard. Any certified device used for determining the accuracy of a\nmeter or accessory. (y) Transfer\nprover. A test-standard for testing gas meters consisting of a master meter, an\nelectronic control panel, pressure and temperature correcting gauges, a blower, flow control valves, and exhaust silencers. The test is conducted by connecting\nthe transfer prover with the meter under test. The quantity of air indicated on\nthe meter under test is compared with the quantity of air measured on the\ntransfer prover. (z) Utility. Includes all gas corporations as defined in the Public Service Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
