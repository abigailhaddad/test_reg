  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 821.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words, or phrases hereinafter\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number assigned to any designated waters\nfor the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe\nnumbering or index system used to identify specific waters of New York was\nadapted from that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its\nstocking lists. The primary waters of a drainage basin, a stream or large lake, is referred to by name or abbreviation. Ponds and lakes are numbered\nconsecutively as they are encountered, such number being preceded by the letter\nP. This system also involves the consecutive numbering or tributaries as they\nenter a stream, progressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of lakes or\nponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around\nthe lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. Isolated lakes and ponds are\nreferenced by a waters index number merely for convenience of their\nidentification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not\nnecessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to which no\nsurface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its \"Revised Stocking\n\nList of the Genesee River System - March 1952\" and has been closely followed in\nconnection with the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of\nstreams originally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department\nat the time of the list's publication but not shown on newer maps reproduced\nherein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on\nthe newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Upper Genesee River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\n\nOnt. Lake Ontario\n\nPrimary waters. Ont. 117\n\nGenesee River\nA primary drainage basin of the State numbering\nclockwise from the St. Lawrence River. Ont. 117-27\n\nHoneoye Creek\n\nThe 27th tributary of the Genesee River numbering\nfrom the mouth upstream. Ont. 117-27-34\n\nHemlock Outlet\n\nThe 34th tributary of Honeoye Creek numbering from\nthe mouth upstream. Ont. 117-27-34 -P 44\n\nHemlock Lake\n\nThe 44th pond encountered in the Genesee River\ndrainage basin. Ont. 117-27-34 -P 44-7\n\nSpringwater Creek\n\nThe 7th tributary of Hemlock Lake numbering\nclockwise from the mouth. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib\nand\ntribs\nindicating tributary and tributaries, and the terms\nsubtributary\nand\nsubtributaries\nshall mean\nany stream, pond, or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, pond, or other body of surface water; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated water\nshall include only the stream, pond, or other body of water referenced by such\nwaters index number; where tributary, tributaries, subtributary or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, pond, or other body of water\nreferenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries\nthereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designations of\nsegments or sections of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class or standards shall apply. Also, included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classification or standards. (f) Map ref. no., as appearing in table I, means map reference number and indicates one or more\nof the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on\nwhich maps the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown\nwithin the topographical limit line of the described drainage basin.
