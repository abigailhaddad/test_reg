Melting point not less than 80 degrees\n\nCentigrade. Iron oxide. Red iron oxide containing 95 percent to 98 percent\nFE\n2\n0\n3, with a yellowish tone\non reduction. Moisture content less than 0.1 percent. PREPARING INSENSITIVE POWDER\nBefore mixing, the ingredients are sieved through a 30 mesh\nscreen to remove lumps and coarse particles. For mixing, the desired proportion\nof each ingredient is weighed and they are sieved together through a 30 mesh\nscreen 10 times. Sufficient mixture of a given ratio of TNT and iron oxide\nshould be prepared in one batch to test all the caps which are to be fired in\nthat mixture. The mixed powder is tamped uniforqqly by hand into one and\none-quarter inch by four inch paraffin-sprayed shells to a density such that\nthe finished cartridges weigh approximately 70 grams each. TESTING PROCEDURE\nIn carrying out the test, a cap is inserted in the hand-crimped\nend of the cartridge as in priming a stick of dynamite. Blasting caps are\ninserted so that the top of the shell is even with the end of the cartridge, while electric blasting caps are embedded in the powder up to the bead. The\nassembly of cartridge and cap is fired in a vertical position. It the\ninsensitive powder completely detonates, there is no residue; but if it fails, a stub or butt crimp of the cartridge remains after the shot. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS\nIron oxide desensitizes TNT, and the greater the proportion of\niron oxide in that mixture, the less sensitive that mixture becomes, and the\nstronger the cap must be in order to detonate the mixture. A comparison of the\nstrength of caps is therefore possible by determining the percentage of\ndetonations and failures with a given insensitive mixture or by comparing the\ncaps with several insensitive mixtures of varying degree of\nsensitiveness. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. tit. 12, Appendices, app\nA-11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
