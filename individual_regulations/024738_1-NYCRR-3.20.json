  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 3.20 - Cleaning and sanitizing of containers and equipment-item 12p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All multiuse\ncontainers and utensils shall be thoroughly cleaned after each use, and all\nequipment shall be thoroughly cleaned at least once each day when used, provided that, storage tanks shall be cleaned when emptied and shall be emptied\nat last once every 72 hours. Storage tanks which are used to store raw milk or\nwhey longer than 24 hours and silo tanks used for the storage of raw milk or\nwhey, and which are installed after the adoption of this Part, shall be\nequipped with a temperature-recording device complying with the specifications\nof Appendix 9 of this Title. (b) Drying equipment, cloth-collector systems, packaging equipment, and multiuse\ndry milk products and dry whey storage containers, shall be cleaned at\nintervals and by methods recommended by the manufacturer and approved by the\nregulatory agency. Note: Appendix 11 of this Title contains additional\ninformation on dry cleaning of drying equipment, packaging equipment, and dry\nmilk product and dry whey storage containers. (c) Storage bins used to transport dry\nproducts shall be drycleaned after each usage, and washed and sanitized at\nregular intervals. (d) Pipelines\nand equipment designed for mechanical cleaning shall meet the following\nrequirements: (1)\n\nAn effective cleaning and\nsanitizing regimen for each separate cleaning circuit shall be established and\nutilized. (2)\nA\ntemperature-recording device, complying with the specifications in Appendix 9\nof this Title, shall be installed in the return-solution line to record the\ntemperature and time during which the line or equipment is exposed to cleaning\nand sanitizing. (3)\n\nTemperature-recording charts shall be identified, dated, and retained for three\nmonths. (4)\n\nDuring each official\ninspection, the regulatory agency shall examine and initial\ntemperature-recording charts. (e) All multiuse containers, equipment and\nutensils shall be sanitized before use, employing one or a combination of the\nfollowing methods: (1)\nexposure to an\nenclosed jet of steam for not less than one minute; (2)\ncomplete immersion in hot water at a\ntemperature of at least 170° F (77° C) for at least five minutes, or exposure\nto a flow of hot water at a temperature of at least 170° F (77° C), as\ndetermined by use of an acceptable indicating thermometer located at the\noutlet, for at least five minutes; (3)\nexposure to hot air at a temperature of\nat least 180° F (83° C) for at least 20 minutes, as measured by an acceptable\nindicating thermometer located in the coldest zone; (4)\ncomplete immersion for at least one\nminute in, or exposure for at least one minute to, a flow of chemical sanitizer\nof acceptable strength. All product-contact surfaces must be wetted by the\nsanitizing solution and piping so treated must be filled. Sanitizing sprays may\nbe used. Chemical solutions, once used, shall not be reused for sanitizing but\nmay be reused for other purposes. Assembled equipment must be sanitized prior\nto each day's run. (See Appendix 6 of this Title for a more complete discussion\nof sanitizers and sanitizing techniques.)\n(f) For high-pressure lines, use of an\nalkaline cleaner at 160° F (72° C) for 30 minutes, followed by an acid cleaner\nfor 30 minutes at the same temperature is satisfactory. Effective sanitization\nof the dryer may be accomplished by the following procedure: (1)\n\nOperate spray nozzles with water at\ntemperature and rates at least as high as those employed during the drying\noperation. (2)\n\nAdjust airflow to\ngive at least 0.5-inch (water) pressure in the drying chamber. (3)\n\nContinue the operation for 20 minutes\nwhile a temperature of not less than 185° F (85° C) is being registered at the\ndischarge from the dryer. Portions of the drying system not reached by this\ntreatment, or dryers for which this procedure is not practical, shall be\ntreated by one of the methods prescribed above. (g) The residual bacteria count of multiuse\nand single-service containers used for the packaging of dry products shall no\nexceed one per milliliter of capacity when the rinse test is used, or not over\n50 colonies per 8 square inches (one per square centimeter) of product-contact\nsurface when the swab test is used, in three out of four samples taken at\nrandom on a given day. All multiuse and single-service containers shall be free\nof coliform organisims. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n3.20\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
