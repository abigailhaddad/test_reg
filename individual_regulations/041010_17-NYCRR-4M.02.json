Tit. 17 § 4M.02 - Meaning of Lane-Use Control Signal Indications\n\nState Regulations\nINSERT the following paragraph: Support: 01A Section 1116 of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic\n\nLaw specifies that traffic facing a flashing yellow X signal may travel in any\nlane over which such signal is shown preparatory to making a left turn, using\nproper caution. The MUTCD equivalent of this device is for a signal face to\nhave either a WHITE TWO-WAY LEFT TURN ARROW or a WHITE ONE-WAY LEFT TURN ARROW. At this time, the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law does not allow a\nsignal face to have either of the two signal indications involving white turn\narrows. DELETE C. and D. of Paragraph 01. INSERT the following text at the end of Paragraph\n01: Standard: F. A\nsteady WHITE TWO-WAY LEFT TURN ARROW signal indication shall not be used in New\n\nYork, pending legislative action to amend Section\n1116\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. G. A steady WHITE ONE-WAY LEFT TURN ARROW signal indication shall not be used in\n\nNew York, pending legislative action to amend Section\n1116\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
