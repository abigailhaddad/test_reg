  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 229.43 - Verification of interchangeability\n\nState Regulations\n\nTo assure that the burning qualities of the distributed\ngas do not vary sufficiently to adversely affect the safety and/or efficiency\nof any appliances, each company shall maintain and operate suitable test\nequipment, during the periods when its manufactured gas plant and/or gas mixing\nstation is operating, to compare the burning qualities of the distributed gas\nwith those of the gas with which its consumers' appliances have been adjusted. The types and adjustments of said test equipment shall be representative of\nthose of its consumers' appliances. The performance of said test equipment\nshall be observed at frequent intervals whenever supplement, substitute or\ndiluent gas is added to the gas usually distributed and be considered to be\nindicative of the actual interchangeability of the gases involved. Records\nshall be kept of the periodic observation of the performance of said test\nequipment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n229.43\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
