(b) A bridge loan, as defined in subdivision\n(a) of this section, may be made by a lender for maximum term of one year. A\nbridge loan may be made, at the option of the lender, without any required\nrepayment of either principal or interest during the term of the loan, provided\nthat no compounding of interest occurs. In addition, the period for the loan\nmay be divided into two terms, in which event, prior to commencement of the\nadditional term, the borrower may be required to pay off any interest\naccumulated over the first term. (c) All bridge loans shall be offered under\nthe following terms and conditions: (1)\n\nThe\nloan shall be due and payable upon the closing of the borrower's sale of the\nproperty securing the loan. (2)\n\nThe\nloan may be prepaid by the borrower at any time, without penalty. (3)\n\nThe notification provisions of section\n82.5\nof this Part shall apply to\nthe loan throughout its duration. (4)\n\nThe disclosure provisions of section\n82.6\nof this Part shall apply, except that the alternative disclosures for balloon-payment loans contained in\nsection\n82.6\n(b) of this\n\nPart shall be stated as: (i) In the case where\nthe lender is offering a single term loan, or where the lender will offer an\nextension of the loan, which extension was not provided for at the commencement\nof the loan: THE TERM OF THE LOAN IS [MONTHS] [ONE YEAR]. AS A RESULT, YOU\nWILL BE REQUIRED TO REPAY THE ENTIRE PRINCIPAL BALANCE AND ANY ACCRUED INTEREST\nTHEN OWING [MONTHS] [ONE YEAR] FROM THE DATE ON WHICH THE LOAN IS MADE. THE LENDER HAS NO OBLIGATION TO REFINANCE THIS LOAN AT THE\nEND OF ITS TERM. THEREFORE, YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPAY THE LOAN OUT OF ASSETS\nYOU OWN OR YOU MAY HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER LENDER WILLING TO REFINANCE THE\nLOAN. (ii)\n\nIn the case\nwhere the lender is offering a loan divided into two terms: THE TERM OF THE LOAN IS MONTHS. AT MATURITY, MONTHS FROM THE\nDATE ON WHICH THE LOAN IS MADE, AND IN THE EVENT A REFINANCING IS REQUIRED, THE\nLOAN WILL BE EXTENDED AT [AN INTEREST RATE TO BE DETERMINED AT THE SOLE\nDISCRETION OF THE LENDER] [THE SAME RATE] [THE SAME RATE TO BE DETERMINED BY\nMOVEMENT IN INDEX]. SUCH INTEREST RATE MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE INTEREST RATE TO\nBE PAID ON THIS LOAN. In cases where the lender will extend the loan for a second\nterm at the same rate of interest, the last sentence of the above disclosure\nshall be omitted. (5)\n\nWhether the loan is offered for one term\nor two terms, fees and points may be taken only once at the inception of the\nloan, and the borrower may not be charged more than three points at that time. For purposes of this section: (i) permissible\nfees are limited to a property appraisal fee and the fees and expenses for\nobtaining a credit history of the applicant. Any amount collected in excess of\nthe actual cost of the credit report fee and property appraisal fee must be\nreturned at or prior to closing; and\n(ii)\na point is one percent of the principal\namount of the loan, which may be charged only at the time of closing of the\nbridge loan. (6)\n\nThe\nloan shall be at a fixed rate of interest within each term of the\nloan. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
