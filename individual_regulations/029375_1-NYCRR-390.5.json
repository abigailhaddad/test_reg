Criteria to be used by the commissioner in determining approval of\napplications are as follows: (i) the\nresponsiveness of the grant application to the analytical factors required\nunder section\n324\nor\n324-a\nof the Agriculture and Markets\n\nLaw; (ii)\nthe degree to which the\nneed for agricultural protection by the county or the municipality is\nsubstantiated by facts and trends; (iii)\nthe adequacy of the plan of work (e.g., does it relate to the needs identified, is it logically constructed, and can it\nbe accomplished within the timeframe predicted); (iv)\nthe qualifications of the principals who\nwill be developing the plan; (v) the reasonableness of the estimated cost of developing the plan versus the work\nto be performed; (vi)\noverall\ncompliance with procedural requirements of article 25-AAA of the Agriculture\nand Markets Law; and\n(vii)\nthe\ncompleteness of the application. (2)\n\nThe commissioner, in consultation with\nthe advisory council on agriculture, shall determine whether or not an\napplication shall receive funding within 90 days from the receipt of a complete\napplication. The commissioner may negotiate the amount of funds awarded versus\nfunds requested. The standard for determining the amount of funds awarded is\nthe extent to which the plan meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, as well as mutually acceptable modifications of the\napplication and/or plan of work, and the availability of funds in relation to\nthe number of eligible applications received. (d) Eligible costs. The following costs shall\nbe eligible for State reimbursement: (1)\npersonal services, including fringe benefits for professional, secretarial, and\nlegal services related directly to the development of the plan; (2)\nconsultant services; (3)\ntravel; (4)\nconducting public hearings; (5)\nexpendable supplies; (6)\nprinting; and\n(7)\ncommunication. State planning grant funds shall not be made available for\nthe purchase of equipment, non- expendable supplies, or implementation of\nmeasures recommended in a plan. (e) Funding limits and matching requirements. State grant funds shall not exceed $50,000 to each county or $100,000 to two\ncounties applying jointly and shall not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of\npreparing a county agricultural and farmland protection plan, or $25,000 to\neach municipality or $50,000 to two municipalities applying jointly and shall\nnot exceed 75 percent of the total cost of preparing a municipal agricultural\nand farmland protection plan. Sum total of State grants shall not exceed\n$50,000 per county or $25,000 per municipality regardless of whether that\ncounty or that municipality receives only one award or multiple awards. County\nfunds must match State funds at least on a one-to-one basis and at least 20\npercent of its contribution must be cash (i.e., for initial as well as each\nsupplemental county funding). For example, 20 percent of 50 percent of $50,000\nequals a $5,000 cash contribution from the county. Municipal funds must match\n\nState funds at least on a one-to-three basis and at least 20 percent of its\ncontribution must be cash (i.e., for initial as well as each supplemental\nmunicipal funding). For example, 20 percent of 25 percent of $25,000 total\nproject cost equals a $1,250 cash contribution from the municipality. In-kind\nservices matches are acceptable for all eligible costs categories identified in\nsubdivision (d) of this section, as well as for those items set forth in the\ndefinition of in-kind services in section\n390.2\n(g) of this\n\nPart. Indirect and overhead charges and volunteer services are not acceptable\nas match. Counties or the municipalities are authorized to use as a match any\nprivate or other public (non-State) funds obtained to develop a plan. (f) Funding and reporting requirements. The\ndepartment shall provide all funds to the county or the municipality through a\nwritten contract, and shall incorporate the plan of work and approved budget. All funds to the county or the municipality under the contract shall be paid\nonly after submission of a State standard voucher by the county or the\nmunicipality, which shall be subject to approval by the State Comptroller and\nthe availability of funds. At the commissioner's discretion, an advance of up\nto 25 percent of the total State funds awarded may be made under the contract\nto the county or the municipality to initiate plan development. Whether an\nadvance will be made, and the amount of same, is based upon the county's or the\nmunicipality's written request for an advance and statement of need, including\nthe percentage of the funds requested, and the commissioner's determination\nthat the advance is necessary for the county or the municipality to initiate\nplan development. Thereafter, the remaining State funds will be provided on a\nreimbursement basis subject to the submission of quarterly progress reports. Ten percent of all State funds awarded shall be withheld until the commissioner\nverifies that the entire plan of work is completed. (g) Plan updates. A county which has an\napproved agricultural and farmland protection plan may after 120 months from\nthe date of such approval by the commissioner, apply for additional State\nassistance payments for planning activities related to the updating of its\ncurrent agricultural and farmland protection plan or development of a new plan. Such additional assistance payments shall not exceed $50,000 to each county\nagricultural and farmland protection board or $100,000 to two such boards\napplying jointly, and shall not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of\npreparing an agricultural and farmland protection plan.
