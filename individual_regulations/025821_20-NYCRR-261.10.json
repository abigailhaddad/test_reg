  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 261.10 - Accounting methods\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 5(c) of § 1340(c); Codes and Ordinances of the\n\nCity of Yonkers, § 92-102(c)\n(a) General. A nonresident taxpayer's method of accounting for\npurposes of the City of Yonkers earnings tax must be the same as such\ntaxpayer's method of accounting for Federal income tax\npurposes. (b) Absences of Federal method of accounting. (1)\n\nIn the event a nonresident taxpayer does\nnot have a Federal method of accounting, such taxpayer must compute City of\n\nYonkers earnings on the accounting basis regularly used in keeping such\ntaxpayer's books. If such method does not clearly reflect such taxpayer's\nearnings, the computation of City of Yonkers earnings shall be made in a manner\nwhich, in the opinion of the State Tax Commission, clearly reflects such\ntaxpayer's earnings. (2)\nA method\nof accounting which consistently applies generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in a particular trade or business, in accordance with recognized\nconditions or practices, will ordinarily be regarded as clearly reflecting\nearnings, provided all items of income, gain, loss and deduction are treated\nconsistently from year to year. (3)\nA nonresident taxpayer may compute City of Yonkers earnings under any method of\naccounting which is permissible for Federal income tax purposes, e.g., cash, accrual, installment or long-term contract basis, or any combination thereof which clearly reflects earnings. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n261.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
