In addition to the definitions given in section\n2 of the Flammable Fabrics Act as amended (sec. 1, 81 Stat. 568; 15\nU.S.C. 1191\n) and §7.2 of the procedures\n(33 F.R. 14642, October 1, 1968), the following definitions apply for the\npurpose of this standard: (2) Thigh (girth) - Measured horizontally around the upper part\nof the leg, close up to the crotch (H through N to H, fig. 2). (b) \"Ticking\" means the outermost layer of fabric or related\nmaterial that encloses the mattress core and upholstery materials. (c) \"Core\" means the main support system that may be present in\na mattress, such as springs, foam, or hair block. (d) \"Upholstery material\" means all material, either loose or\nattached, between the ticking or between the ticking and the core of the\nmattress, if a core is present. (2) Thigh (girth) - Measured horizontally around the upper part\nof the leg, close up to the crotch (H through N to H, fig. 2). (f) \"Quilted\" means stitched through the ticking and one or\nmore layers of upholstery material. (g) \"Tufted\" means buttoned or laced through the ticking and\nupholstery materials and/or core. (h) \"Mattress prototype\" means mattresses of a particular\ndesign, sharing all materials (excluding differences in metallic core\nmaterials) and methods of assembly, but excluding differences in mattress\nsize. (i) \"Mattress type\" means mattresses -sharing a method of\nassembly such as tufted, multineedle continuous quilt, deep panel quilt, and\nsmooth top, and all materials affecting cigarette ignition, but excluding\ndifferences in mattress size. More than one mattress prototype may be included\nin a single mattress type, provided each protoype has the same method of\nassembly. (j) \"Production unit\" (unit) means a quantity of mattresses of\none mattress type. This quantity is predetermined by the mattress manufacturer\nsubject to the maximum number specified in the applicable parts of.4(b)\n\nSpecimens and sampling. No mattress completed while other mattresses of the\nsame type are in production shall be excluded from the production unit to which\nsuch other mattresses are assigned. (k) \"Surface\" means one side of a mattress which is intended\nfor sleeping upon and which can be tested..2 Scope and application. (a) This standard provides a test method to determine the\nignition resistance of a mattress when exposed to a lighted cigarette. (2) Thigh (girth) - Measured horizontally around the upper part\nof the leg, close up to the crotch (H through N to H, fig. 2). (2) Thigh (girth) - Measured horizontally around the upper part\nof the leg, close up to the crotch (H through N to H, fig. 2). (d) One-of-a-kind mattress, such as nonstandard sizes or\nshapes, may be excluded from testing under this standard pursuant to rules and\nregulations established by the Federal Trade Commission..3 General requirements--\n(a) Summary of test method.-- The method involves the exposure\nof the mattress surface to lighted cigarettes as the standard igniting source\nin a draft-protected environment and the measurement of the ignition resistance\nof the mattress. These exposures include smooth, tape edge, and quilted or\ntufted locations, if they exist on the mattress surface. Two-sheet tests are\nalso conducted on similar surface locations. In the latter test, the burning\ncigarette is placed between the sheets. (b) Test criterion. Testing the mattress surface in accordance\nwith the testing procedure set forth in.4 Test procedure, individual cigarette\ntest locations pass the test if the char length on the mattress surface is not\nmore than 5.1 cm. (2 in.) In any direction from the nearest point of the\ncigarette. (In the interest of safety, the test operator should discontinue the\ntest and record a failure before reaching the 2-inch char length if, in his\nopinion, an obvious ignition has occurred.).4 Test procedure--\n(a) Apparatus--\n(1) Test room. The test room shall be large enough to\naccommodate a full-scale mattress in a horizontal position and to allow for\nfree movement of personnel and air around the test mattress. The room shall be\nequipped with a support system (platform, bench, etc.) upon which a mattress\nmay be placed flat in a horizontal position at a reasonable height for making\nobservations. For thin, flexible mattresses and mattress pads, the top surface\nof the support system shall be nonmetallic. The test area shall be draft\nprotected and equipped with a suitable system for exhausting smoke and/or\nnoxious gases produced by testing. The test room atmospheric conditions shall\nbe between 18°-27° C. (65° - 80° F.) and at less than 55\npercent relative humidity. (2) Ignition source. The ignition source shall be cigarettes\nwithout filter tips made from natural tobacco, 85 +- 2 mm. long with a tobacco\npacking density of 0.270 +- 0.020 g./cm.3 and a total weight of 1.1 +- 0.1\ngm. (3) Fire extinguisher. A pressurized water fire extinguisher, or other suitable fire extinguishing equipment, shall be immediately\navailable. (4) Water bottle. A water bottle fitted with a spray nozzle\nshall be used to extinguish the ignited portions of the mattress. (5) Scale. A linear scale graduated in millimeters, 0.1 inch, or 1/16-inch divisions shall be used to measure char length. (6) Other apparatus. In addition to the above, a thermometer, a\nrelative humidity measuring instrument, a knife or scissors, and tongs are\nrequired to carry out the testing. (b) Specimens and sampling--\n(1) General. The test criterion of.3(b) shall be used in\nconjunction with the following mattress sampling plan, or any other approved by\nthe Department of Commerce that provides at least the equivalent level of fire\nsafety to the consumer. Alternate sampling plans submitted for approval shall\nhave operating characteristics such that the probability of unit acceptance at\nany percentage defective does not exceed the corresponding probability of unit\nacceptance of the following sampling plan in the region of the latter's\noperating characteristic curves that lies between 5 and 95 percent acceptance\nprobability. (2) Mattress sampling. The basic mattress sampling plan is made\nup of two parts: (1) Prototype qualification, and\n(2) production testing. In addition, a batch sampling plan is\ngiven which may be used for small production quantities when shipping\nrequirements prohibit the use of the basic plan, or for other reasons at the\ndiscretion of the manufacturer. a. Basic sampling plan. A production unit in the basic sampling\nplan shall consist of not more than 500 mattresses of a mattress type or the\nquantity produced in 3 consecutive calendar months, whichever is smaller. This\nunit size may be increased to the quantity produced in 3 consecutive calendar\nmonths or less: Provided, That it is either documented that each of the\nmaterials contributing to the cigarette ignition characteristics of all the\nmattresses in the unit came from a single manufacturing lot of such material or\n50 consecutive production units, at least 20,000 mattresses, have all been\naccepted in production testing as set forth in.4(b)(2)a2. 1. Prototype qualification. For prototype qualification, the\nterm \"manufacturer\" shall mean (a) with respect to a company having one\nmanufacturing facility, that company, (b) with respect to a company having two\nor more manufacturing facilities, either that company or one or more of its\nmanufacturing facilities as it elects, and (c) with respect to a company that\nis part of a group of companies that normally sell mattresses under a group\nname, either that group of companies or a portion of that group or (a) or (b)\nabove, as that company elects. Select enough mattress prototypes from preproduction or current\nproduction to provide six surfaces for test (three mattresses if both sides can\nbe tested or six mattresses if only one side can be tested). Test each of the\nsix surfaces according to.4(d) testing. If all the cigarette test locations on\nall six surfaces satisfy the test criterion of.3(b), accept the mattress\nprototype. If one or more of the cigarette test locations on the six surfaces\nfall the test criterion of.3(b), reject the mattress prototype. Mattress prototype qualification may be repeated after the\nmanufacturer has taken action to improve the resistance of the mattress\nprototype to ignition by cigarettes-through mattress design, production, or\nmaterials selection, Each mattress prototype must be accepted in prototype\nqualification prior to shipping any mattresses to customers and prior to\nproducing significant quantities of mattresses. The first production unit not\nto exceed 500 mattresses, manufactured immediately after successful prototype\nqualification or the production unit from which the mattresses were selected\nfor the successful prototype qualification may be accepted and shipped to\ncustomers without further testing if all mattresses in the production unit are\nthe same as the prototype except for size. 2. Production testing. For production testing, the term\n\"manufacturer\" shall mean each remanufacturing facility. Random selection for\nproduction testing shall be accomplished by use of random number tables or\nequivalent means as determined by the Federal Trade Commission. If it is\ndesired to use only mattresses of a specified size (e.g., \"twin\") for testing, the drawing may be repeated until sufficient mattresses of that size have been\nselected. A production unit, except for the first production unit\nfollowing successful prototype qualification as specified in.4 (b)(2)a1, is\neither accepted or rejected according to the following plan: (2) Thigh (girth) - Measured horizontally around the upper part\nof the leg, close up to the crotch (H through N to H, fig. 2). Unit rejection shall include all mattresses in the particular\nunit under test. Unit rejection also results in the loss of prototype\nqualification for all prototypes included in the unit under test. (b) Reduced sampling. The level of sampling required for\nmattress production acceptance may be reduced provided the preceding 15\nconsecutive units of mattresses, at least 500 mattresses, have all been\naccepted using the normal sampling plan. In this case, the production quantity\nfor reduced sampling may be increased to up to two units, still not to exceed\nthe production of 3 consecutive calendar months. From this production quantity, randomly select enough\nmattresses to provide two surfaces for test. Test each of the two surfaces\naccording to.4(d) testing. If all the cigarette test locations on both surfaces\nmeet the test criterion of.3(b), accept this production quantity. If two or\nmore individual cigarette test locations fail the test criterion of.3(b), reject this production quantity. If only one individual cigarette test location\nfails the test criterion of.3(b), accept this production quantity. Rejection shall include all mattresses in the production\nquantity under test. Rejection also results in the loss of prototype\nqualification for all prototypes included in the production quantity under\ntest. Testing after the new type qualification shall be according to the normal\nsampling plan. b. Batch sampling plan. For the batch sampling plan, the term\n\"manufacturer\" shall mean each manufacturing facility. A production unit in the batch sampling plan shall consist of\nnot more than 250 mattresses or the quantity produced in one period of 30\nconsecutive calendar days, whichever is smaller. 1. Batch unit qualification and acceptance. Select enough\nmattresses from the initial production of the unit to provide four surfaces for\ntest (two mattresses if both sides can be tested or four mattresses if only one\nside can be tested). Test each of the four surfaces according to.4(d) testing, if all the cigarette test locations on the four surfaces meet the test\ncriterion of.3(b), accept the unit. If one or more of the cigarette test\nlocations on the four surfaces fail the test criterion of.3(b). reject the\nunit. After rejection, unit qualification and acceptance under this\nbatch sampling plan may be repeated after the resistance of the mattress to\nignition by cigarettes is improved by the manufacturer taking corrective action\nin mattress design, production, or materials selection. Acceptance of any production unit under this hatch sampling\nplan shall not have any effect on prototype qualification or unit acceptance of\nany other production unit. (2) Thigh (girth) - Measured horizontally around the upper part\nof the leg, close up to the crotch (H through N to H, fig. 2). (4) Records. Records of all unit sizes, test results, and the\ndisposition of rejected units shall be maintained by the manufacturer, in\naccordance with rules and regulations established by the Federal Trade\n\nCommission. (2) Thigh (girth) - Measured horizontally around the upper part\nof the leg, close up to the crotch (H through N to H, fig. 2). (2) Thigh (girth) - Measured horizontally around the upper part\nof the leg, close up to the crotch (H through N to H, fig. 2). (7) Sheet preparation. The sheets shall be laundered once\nbefore use in an automatic home washer using the hot water setting and longest\nnormal cycle with the manufacturer's recommended quantity of a commercial\ndetergent, and dried in an automatic home tumble dryer. The sheet shall be cut\nacross the width into two equal parts after washing. (8) Cigarettes. Unopened packages of cigarettes shall be\nselected for each series of tests. (c) Conditioning. The mattresses, washed sheets, and cigarettes\nshall be conditioned at a temperature of 18-27° C (65-80° F) and a\nrelative humidity less than 55 percent for at least 48 hours prior to test. The\nmattresses, washed sheets and cigarettes shall be removed from any packaging\nand supported in a suitable manner to permit free movement of air around them\nduring conditioning. The mattress meets this conditioning requirement if the\nmattress and/or all its component materials have been exposed only to the above\ntemperature and humidity conditions for at least 48 hours prior to testing the\nmattress. (d) Testing--\n(1) General. a. Light and place one cigarette at a time on the mattress\nsurface. (If previous experience with the same type of mattress has indicated\nthat ignition is not likely, the number of cigarettes which may be lighted and\nplaced on the mattress at one time is left to the test operator's judgment. The\nnumber of cigarettes must be carefully considered because a smoldering or\nburning mattress is extremely hazardous and difficult to extinguish.) If more\nthan one cigarette is burning at one time, the cigarettes must be positioned no\nless than 6 inches apart on the mattress surface. Each cigarette used as an\nignition source shall be well lighted but not burned more than 4 mm. (0.16 in.)\nwhen placed on the mattress. (Fire extinguishing equipment must be readily\navailable at all times.)\nb. If a cigarette extinguishes before burning its full length, the test must be repeated with a freshly lit cigarette on a different portion\nof the same type of location on the mattress surface until either (a) the\nnumber of cigarettes specified in.4(d)(1)c have burned their full lengths, (b)\nthe number of cigarettes specified have extinguished before burning their full\nlengths, or (c) the number of cigarettes specified have resulted in failures\naccording to.3(b) test criterion. c. At least 18 cigarettes shall be burned on each mattress test\nsurface, nine in the bare mattress tests and nine in the two-sheet tests. If\nthree or more mattress surface locations (smooth surface, tape edge, quilted, or tufted areas) exist in the particular mattress surface under test, three\ncigarettes shall be burned on each different surface location. If only two\nmattress surface locations exist in the particular mattress surface under test\n(tape edge and smooth surface), four cigarettes shall be burned on the smooth\nsurface and five cigarettes shall be burned on the tape edge. (2) Bare mattress tests--\na. Smooth surfaces. Each burning cigarette shall be placed\ndirectly on a smooth surface location on the test surface on the half reserved\nfor bare mattress tests. The cigarettes should burn their full lengths on a\nsmooth surface without burning across a tuft or stitching of a quilted area. However, if this is not possible because of mattress design, then the\ncigarettes shall be positioned on the mattress in a manner which will allow as\nmuch of the butt ends its possible to burn on smooth surfaces. Report results\nfor each cigarette as pass or fail as defined in the test criterion. CAUTION: Even under the most carefully observed conditions, smoldering combustion can progress to the point where it cannot be readily\nextinguished. It is imperative that a test be discontinued as soon as ignition\nhas definitely occurred. Immediately wet the exposed area with a water spray\n(from water bottle), cut around the burning material with a knife or scissors\nand pull the material out of the mattress with tongs. Make sure that all\ncharred or burned material is removed. Ventilate the room. b. Tape edge. Each burning cigarette shall be placed in the\ndepression between the mattress top surface and the tape edge, parallel to the\ntape edge on the half of the test surface reserved for bare mattress tests. If\nthere is no depression at the edge, support the cigarettes in place along the\nedge and parallel to the edge with straight pins. Three straight pins may be\ninserted through the edge at a 45° angle such that one pin supports the\ncigarette at the burning end, one at the center, and one at the butt. The heads\nof the pins must be below the upper surface of the cigarette (see Figure 2). Report results for each cigarette as pass or fall as defined in the test\ncriterion. c. Quilted location. If quilting exists on the test surface, each burning cigarette shall be placed on quilted locations of the test\nsurface. The cigarettes shall be positioned directly over the thread in the\ndepression created by the quilting process on the half of the test surface\nreserved for bare mattress tests. if the quilt design is such that the\ncigarettes can-not burn their full lengths over the thread, then the cigarettes\nshall be positioned in a manner which will allow as much of the butt ends as\npossible to burn on the thread. Report results for each cigarette as pass or\nfail as defined in the test criterion. d. Tufted location. If tufting exists on the test surface, each\nburning cigarette shall be placed on tufted locations of the test surface. The\ncigarettes shall be positioned so that they burn down into the depression\ncaused by the tufts and so that the butt ends of the cigarettes burn out over\nthe buttons or laces used in the tufts on the half of the test surface reserved\nor bare mattress tests. Report results for each cigarette as pass or fail as\ndefined in the test criterion. (3) Two-sheet tests. Spread a section of sheet smoothly over\nthe mattress surface and tuck under the mattress on the second half of the test\nsurface, which has been reserved for the two-sheet test. Care must be taken\nthat hems or any other portion of the sheet which is more than one fabric\nthickness, is neither directly under nor directly over the test cigarette in\nthe two-sheet test. a. Smooth surfaces. Each burning cigarette shall be placed\ndirectly on the sheet covered mattress in a smooth surface location as defined\nin the bare mattress test. Immediately cover the first sheet and the burning\ncigarettes loosely with a second, or top, sheet (see Figure 2). Do not raise or\nlift the top sheet during testing unless obvious ignition has occurred or until\nthe cigarette has burned out. (The extinguishment of the cigarette may be\ndetermined by holding the hand near the surface of the top sheet over the test\nlocation. If neither heat is felt or smoke observed, the cigarette has burned\nout.) If ignition occurs, immediately remove the sheets and cigarette and\nfollow the cautionary procedures outlined in the bare mattress test. Report\nresults for each cigarette as pass or fail as defined in the test\ncriterion. b. Tape edge. Each burning cigarette shall be placed in the\ndepression between the top surface and the tape edge on top of the sheet, and\nimmediately covered with a second sheet. It is important that the air space be\neliminated, as much as possible, between the mattress and the bottom sheet at\nthe test location before testing. Depress the bottom sheet into the depression\nusing a thin rod or other suitable instrument. In most cases, the cigarettes\nwill remain in place throughout the test; however, if the cigarettes show a\nmarked tendency to roll off the tape edge location, they may be supported with\nstraight pins. Three straight pins may be inserted through the bottom sheet and\ntape at a 45° angle such that one pin supports the cigarette at the burning\nend, one at the center, and one at the butt. The heads of the pins must be\nbelow the upper surface of the cigarette (see Figure 2). Report results for\neach cigarette as pass or fail as defined in the test criterion. c. Quilted locations. If quilting exists on the test surface, each burning cigarette shall be placed in a depression caused by quilting, directly over the thread and on the bottom sheet, and immediately covered with\nthe ton sheet. It is important that the air space be eliminated, as much as\npossible, between the mattress and the bottom sheet at the test location before\ntesting. Depress the bottom sheet into the depression using a thin rod or other\nsuitable instrument. If the quilt design is such that the cigarettes cannot\nburn their full lengths over the thread, then the cigarettes shall be\npositioned in a manner which will allow as much of the butt tends as possible\nto burn on the thread. Report results for each cigarette as pass or fall as\ndefined in the test criterion. d. Tufted locations. If tufting exists on the test surface, each burning cigarette shall be placed in the depression caused by tufting, directly over the tuft and on the bottom sheet, and immediately covered with\nthe top sheet. It is important that the air space be eliminated, as much as\npossible, between the mattress and the bottom sheet at the test location before\ntesting. Depress the bottom sheet into the depression using a thin rod or other\nsuitable instrument. The cigarettes shall be positioned so that they burn down\ninto the depression caused by the tuft and so that the butt ends of the\ncigarettes burn out over the buttons or laces used in the tufts. Report results\nfor each cigarette as pass or fail as defined in the acceptance criterion..5 Mattress pads--\n(a) Testing. Mattress pads shall be tested in the same manner\nas mattresses according to.4 test procedure except for laundering. (2) Thigh (girth) - Measured horizontally around the upper part\nof the leg, close up to the crotch (H through N to H, fig. 2). ° +-\n2.8° C. (140° +- 5° F.), and drying procedure 6.3.2(B). Maximum\nload shall be 3.64 kg. (8 pounds) and may consist of any combination of test\nitems and dummy pieces. Alternately, a different number of times under another\nwashing and drying procedure may be specified and used, if that procedure has\npreviously been found to be equivalent by the Federal Trade Commission. Such laundering is not required of mattress pads which are not\nintended to be laundered, as determined by the Federal Trade Commission. Mattress pads which are not susceptible to being laundered and\nare labeled \"dry-clean only\" shall be dry-cleaned by a procedure which has\npreviously been found acceptable by the Federal Trade Commission. (c) Labeling--\n(1) Treatment label. If a mattress pad has had a chemical fire\nretardant treatment or contains any fire retardant treated components, it shall\nbe labeled with the letter \"T\" pursuant to rules and regulations established by\nthe Federal Trade Commission. (2) Care label. All mattress pads which have had a chemical\nfire retardant treatment or contain any fire retardant treated components shall\nbe labeled with precautionary instructions to protect the pads from agents or\ntreatments which are known to cause deterioration of their flame resistance. Such labels shall be permanent and otherwise in accordance with rules and\nregulations established by the Federal Trade Commission..6 Glossary of terms--\n(a) Basket pad.
