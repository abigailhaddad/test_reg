  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 604.2 - Judicial exercise of contempt power\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Exercise of the summary contempt\npower. (1)\n\nThe power of the\ncourt to punish summarily contempt committed in its immediate view and presence\nshall be exercised only in exceptional and necessitous circumstances, as\nfollows: (i) Where the\noffending conduct either\n(a) disrupts or threatens to disrupt proceedings actually in progress; or\n(b) destroys or undermines or\ntends seriously to destroy or undermine the dignity and authority of the court\nin a manner and to the extent that it appears unlikely that the court will be\nable to continue to conduct its normal business in an appropriate way; and\n(ii)\n\nThe court reasonably believes that a prompt summary adjudication of contempt\nmay aid in maintaining or restoring and maintaining proper order and\ndecorum. (2)\n\nWherever practical punishment\nshould be determined and imposed at the time of the adjudication of contempt. However, where the court deems it advisable the determination and imposition of\npunishment may be deferred following a prompt summary adjudication of contempt\nwhich satisfies the necessity for immediate judicial corrective or disciplinary\naction. (3)\n\nBefore\nsummary adjudication of contempt the accused shall be given a reasonable\nopportunity to make a statement in his defense or in extenuation of his\nconduct. (b) Exercise of the contempt power\nafter hearing. In all other cases, notwithstanding the occurrence of the\ncontumacious conduct in the view and presence of the sitting court, the\ncontempt shall be adjudicated at a plenary hearing with due process of law\nincluding notice, written charges, assistance of counsel, compulsory process\nfor production of evidence and an opportunity of the accused to confront\nwitnesses against him. (c) Judicial warning of possible\ncontempts. Except in the case of the most flagrant and offensive misbehavior\nwhich in the court's discretion requires an immediate adjudication of contempt\nto preserve order and decorum, the court should warn and admonish the person\nengaged in alleged contumacious conduct that his conduct is deemed contumacious\nand give the person an opportunity to desist before adjudicating him in\ncontempt. Where a person so warned desists from further offensive conduct, there is ordinarily no occasion for an adjudication of contempt. Where a person\nis summarily adjudicated in contempt and punishment deferred and such person\ndesists from further offensive conduct, the court should consider carefully\nwhether there is any need for punishment for the adjudicated\ncontempt. (d) Disqualification of judge. The judge before whom the alleged contumacious\nconduct occurred is disqualified from presiding at the plenary hearing or trial\n(as distinguished from summary action) except with the defendant's consent: (1)\nif the allegedly\ncontumacious conduct consists primarily of personal disrespect to or\nvituperative criticism of the judge; or\n(2)\nif the judge's recollection of, or\ntestimony concerning the conduct allegedly constituting contempt is necessary\nfor an adjudication; or\n(3)\nif the judge concludes that in view\nof his recollection of the events he would be unable to make his decision\nsolely on the basis of the evidence at the hearing. (e) Preference for appeals\nfrom criminal court contempt convictions. Any appeal by an attorney of his\nconviction for the misdemeanor of criminal contempt which is pending in any\ncourt in this judicial department, shall be granted a preference by the\ncourt.
