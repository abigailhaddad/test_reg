Tit. 20 § 528.16 - Tangible personal property sold to contractors for use in erecting structures of tax exempt organizations\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(a)(15)\n(a) Exemption. (1)\n\nTangible personal property sold to a\ncontractor, subcontractor or repairman for use in erecting a structure or\nbuilding of an organization described in Part 529 of this Title, is exempt when\nit is to become an integral component part of such structure or building. Example 1: An exempt organization contracts to have a building erected\non its land. Purchases by its contractor of tangible personal property, such as\nnails, sheetrock and plywood that become part of the structure, are\nexempt. Example 2: A contractor who builds a structure on speculation and\nsubsequently sells the structure to an exempt organization is not entitled to\nthe exemption. Example 3: The owner of real property enters into a contract to erect\na building to be leased, under a long-term lease, to an exempt organization. The contractor's purchases are not exempt as the owner of the building is not\nan exempt organization. Example 4: A contractor owns land on which he erects a building to the\nspecifications of an exempt organization. Under the terms of the contract, the\norganization will not own the land or the building until it is completed and\nready for occupancy. The contractor's purchases are not exempt as the exempt\norganization will not own the building until it is completed. Example 5: Lumber and other materials that are used to build forms are\nnot exempt since they do not become a component part of the structure. Example 6: Equipment rentals such as cranes, bulldozers, backhoes, etc. for use in building a structure for an exempt organization are subject to\ntax. (2)\n\nTangible personal\nproperty sold to a contractor, subcontractor or repairman for use in adding to, altering or improving real property, property or land owned by an organization\ndescribed in Part 529 of this Title is exempt when it becomes an integral\ncomponent part of the structure, building or real property.
