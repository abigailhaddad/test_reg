  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2386.1 - Applicable law\n\nState Regulations\n\nSubdivision twenty-fifth of section\n171\nof the Tax Law, as amended by chapter\n602 of the Laws of 1987 requires the Department of Taxation and Finance to\npromulgate a rule for the purpose of implementing the temporary school district\naddress review, validation and correction process and a limited review process\nfor receiver school districts regarding such district's valuation of total New\n\nYork adjusted gross income as determined by the department, for use in\ndetermining State aid to education. The Department of Taxation and Finance, the\n\nState Education Department and the Division of the Budget have determined, pursuant to such law, to provide appropriate opportunities for validating the\naccuracy of income tax data for selected districts in order that the ratio of\ntaxpayers to census population relative to the statewide average is a valid\nmeasure of identifying school districts in which the incidence of incorrect\nreporting of school district codes by taxpayers may be the greatest. Receiver\nschool districts are defined in subdivision twenty-fifth of section\n171\nof the Tax Law as any school district\nthat was assigned at least 50 personal income tax returns as a result of the\ntemporary school district address review, validation and correction\nprocess. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2386.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
