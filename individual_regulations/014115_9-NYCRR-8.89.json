Tit. 9 § 8.89 - Executive Order No. 89: Declaring an Emergency in Order to Appoint New Jersey and Connecticut Police Officers as Railroad Police Officers to Provide Enhanced Security on Commuter Trains, Buses and Ferries\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, thousands of commuters travel between the states\nof New York, New Jersey and Connecticut via Mass Transit Systems that include\ninterstate rail, bus and ferry systems accessible to the public, and an\nenhanced law enforcement presence on these conveyances is prudent to protect\npublic safety; and\nWHEREAS, terrorists have used explosive and other devices\nto attack public and private transportation systems, as demonstrated by the\nbombings in London in 2005 and in Madrid in 2004, and while there is no known\nconfirmed threat to the New York metropolitan area, mass transit systems\nbetween New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are particularly high-risk\ntargets; and\nWHEREAS, the completed and attempted attacks in New York, including the arrest of Raess Alam Qazi in November 2012 for planning to carry\nout attacks at landmarks in New York; the plot against the PATH railway system\nby Assem Hammoud in 2006; the plot against New York City subways by Najibullah\n\nZazi in 2009; the foiled plots of Faisal Shahzad and his co-conspirators in May\n2010; the October 2012 foiled attempt by Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis to\ndetonate a 1,000 pound car bomb outside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in\n\nLower Manhattan; and the May 2011 arrest of Ahmed Ferhani and Mohamed Mamdouh\nfor plotting to bomb New York City synagogues, during which Ferhani and Mamdouh\ndiscussed additional targets in New York City, including churches and the\n\nEmpire State Building, demonstrate that terrorists continue to pose a\npersistent threat to the State of New York; and\nWHEREAS, the holiday season, including New Year's Eve and\n\nDay is a time of heightened alert and risk of terrorist attack as terrorists\ntypically consider significant, symbolic dates when planning attacks, with the\nobjective of inflicting mass casualties and maximizing the economic and\npsychological damage to the United States, as evidenced by the 2009 Christmas\n\nDay plot to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner; the November 2010 plot to bomb a\nholiday tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon, by a homegrown violent\nextremist; the December 2010 attack on a market filled with Christmas shoppers\nin Stockholm, Sweden, by a suicide bomber; and the December 2010 arrests in the\n\nUnited Kingdom of 12 individuals plotting to conduct attacks during the holiday\nseason; and\nWHEREAS, New York's sister states, the States of\n\nConnecticut and New Jersey, have agreed to deploy police officers from their\nstates to provide increased security on commuter trains, buses and ferries\ngoing to and from New York State; and\nWHEREAS, sworn members of the Connecticut State Police, sworn police officers of any county or municipality in the State of\n\nConnecticut, sworn members of the New Jersey State Police, and sworn police\nofficers of any county or municipality in the State of New Jersey are\nrestricted in their law enforcement authority once such a conveyance crosses\nthe jurisdictional boundary between Connecticut and New York or between New\n\nJersey and New York respectively; and\nWHEREAS, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are all\nmembers of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (\"EMAC\"), which allows\nfor mutual assistance and resource sharing among sister states; and\nWHEREAS, EMAC provides that emergency forces from the\nsending state, while operating within the jurisdictional boundaries of the\nreceiving state pursuant to the compact, shall have the same powers (except\nthat of arrest, unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights and privileges as are afforded forces of the receiving state in which\nthey are performing emergency services; and\nWHEREAS, to utilize the police resources provided by our\nsister states, we must confer police officer powers, including arrest powers, on such officers while they are within the geographic jurisdiction of New York\n\nState; and\nWHEREAS, Section\n88\nof the Railroad\n\nLaw authorizes the Superintendent of the State Police to appoint any person as\na railroad police officer only under prescribed circumstances and subject to\ncertain limitations; and\nWHEREAS, if such circumstances and limitations were applied\nto sworn police officers from our sister states who are serving as railroad\npolice officers from December 31, 2012, through January 1, 2013, such\napplication would prevent, hinder and delay action necessary to respond to a\nterrorist attack or a threat thereof; and\nWHEREAS, Executive Law § 29-a authorizes the\nsuspension, alteration and modification of statutes, local laws, ordinances, orders, rules or regulations, or parts thereof, if compliance with such\nprovisions would prevent, hinder or delay action necessary to cope with a\ndisaster emergency and the inclusion of any other terms and conditions;
