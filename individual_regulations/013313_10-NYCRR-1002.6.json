Such notice shall provide the covered provider with an\nopportunity and a procedure to submit additional or clarifying information\nwithin 30 calendar days of the provider's receipt of such notice to demonstrate\ncompliance with this Part. Failure to submit additional or clarifying\ninformation within the required time period shall result in the determination\nof non-compliance becoming final. (b) Corrective action period. If the\ndetermination of non-compliance becomes final as set forth in subdivision (a)\nof this section or if the department or its designee determines, after\nreviewing and considering any information submitted by the covered provider, that such provider is not in compliance with the requirements of section 1002.2\nor\n1002.3\nof this Part, the provider\nshall receive notice of such determination and a notice to cure.

(c) Corrective action plan. Within 30\ncalendar days of receipt of the covered provider's CAP, the department or its\ndesignee shall either approve such CAP or request clarification or alterations. The covered provider shall make such alterations to the CAP as may be\nreasonably required by the department or its designee. Once the CAP has been\napproved and the covered provider notified, and unless otherwise provided in\nthe approved CAP, the covered provider shall have six months to complete the\nCAP and comply with this Part. (d) Failure to cure. At the conclusion of the period for implementation of an\napproved CAP, the department or its designee may request information from the\ncovered provider to determine whether the CAP has been fully and properly\ncompleted. If it has been so completed, the matter shall be considered closed\nand no further action on the part of the department or the provider shall be\nrequired. If the department or its designee determines that the CAP has not\nbeen fully and properly implemented within the designated corrective action\nperiod, the department or its designee shall provide written notice to the\nprovider and may take one or more of the following actions, taking into account\nthe seriousness of the violations, the nature of the provider's services, and\nthe provider's efforts to correct the violations, if any: (1)\n\nAt its sole discretion, modify the CAP\nand/or extend the time for the provider to complete implementation. (2)\n\nIssue a final determination of\nnon-compliance, together with a notice of the sanctions which the department\nseeks to impose. Such sanctions may include: (i) Redirection of State funds or\n\nState-authorized payments to be used to provide program services, where\npossible and consistent with Federal and State laws; (ii)\n\nSuspension, modification, limitation, or\nrevocation of the provider's license(s) to operate program(s) for the delivery\nof program services; (iii)\n\nSuspension, modification or termination of contracts or other agreements with\nthe covered provider; and\n(iv)\n\nAny\nother lawful actions or penalties deemed appropriate by the department or its\ndesignee. (e) Opportunity for appeal. Within 30 calendar days of receipt of a final\ndetermination of noncompliance and notice of proposed sanctions, a covered\nprovider may request an administrative appeal by submitting a written request\nto the name and address set forth in the notice. The request must include a\ndetailed explanation of the legal and factual bases for the provider's\nchallenge to the determination and all documentation in support of the\nprovider's position. If a request for an administrative appeal is not made\nwithin the required 30 calendar days, the determination of noncompliance shall\nbecome final and the proposed sanction shall be imposed. Unless the department\nseeks to impose a sanction for which an administrative hearing is otherwise\nrequired by statute or regulation, the covered provider's appeal shall be\nlimited to an administrative review of the record. Following the review, the\ncovered provider shall be provided with a final written determination setting\nforth the findings of fact and conclusions of law that support the\ndetermination. If the provider is found to be non-compliant, the proposed\nsanction may be imposed forthwith. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
