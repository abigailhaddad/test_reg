(2)\nA utility must not terminate\nservice for nonpayment of bills to any person it knows to be receiving public\nassistance, if payment for such service is to be made directly to the utility\nby the department of social services or the local social services\nofficial. (b) Final\ntermination notice. (1)\nA final termination\nnotice must state: (i) the earliest date\ntermination may occur; (ii)\nthe\nreasons for termination, including the total amount the customer must pay, and\nhow termination may be avoided; (iii)\nthat utility procedures are available\nfor considering complaints before termination, including the address and\ntelephone number of the appropriate utility office; (iv)\nthat commission procedures are available\nfor considering customer complaints when a customer is not satisfied with the\nutility's handling of the complaint, including the address and telephone number\nof the appropriate commission office; (v) a summary of the protections available\nunder this Part, and a notice that any customer eligible for such protections\nshould contact the utility; (vi)\nthat it is a final termination notice which should be brought directly to the\nattention of the utility when the bill is paid; (vii)\nthat payment of the charges with a\ncheck that is subsequently dishonored may result in termination of service\nwithout an additional final termination notice, if applicable; (viii)\nthat at the time the utility's\nrepresentative goes to the premises to terminate service, the representative\nmay require any payment to be made with cash, certified check or money order, if the customer has, within the last 12 months, paid with a check that was\ndishonored; (ix)\nany charge for\nreconnection; and\n(x) that if the\ncustomer is a recipient of public assistance, it is possible that assistance\nmay be available from a local social services office. (2)\nA final termination notice must not be\nissued until at least 20 calendar days after the date payment was\ndue. (3)\nA final termination notice\nmust not be issued for nonpayment of disputed charges while a complaint is\npending before the utility or the commission as provided in section\n12.3\nof this Title. Nothing in\nthis Part prevents the utility from issuing such notice for nonpayment of\nundisputed charges. (c) Physical termination of service. (1)\nA\nutility may not terminate service under this section until at least: (i) 15 calendar days after a final\ntermination notice has been given personally to the customer; or\n(ii)\n18 calendar days after a final\ntermination notice has been mailed to the customer at the location where\nservice is rendered, or to an alternative address, in which case paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision must be complied with. (2)\n\nIf an alternative address for mailing\npurposes has been previously provided to a utility, the utility must not\nterminate service under this section until at least 18 calendar days after a\nfinal termination notice has been mailed to the customer at the alternative\naddress. If the utility still intends to terminate service as scheduled, the\nutility must mail notice of the scheduled termination to the premises where\nservice is rendered 10 calendar days after the final termination notice was\nmailed to the alternative address. (3)\nA utility may terminate service only\nbetween the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., on Mondays through Thursdays, provided that such day or the following day is not: (i) a public holiday as defined in the\n\nGeneral Construction Law; (ii)\na\nday the main business office of the utility is closed; or\n(iii)\na day the offices of the commission are\nclosed. (4)\nA utility\nmay not terminate service unless: (i) it has\nverified that payment has not been received at any office of the utility or at\nany office of an authorized collection agent through the end of the notice\nperiod required by this Part; and\n(ii)\nit has verified on the day termination\nis scheduled that payment has not been posted to the customer's account as of\nthe opening of business on that day, or has complied with procedures\nestablished under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (5)\nA utility may not terminate service more\nthan 60 calendar days after issuance of the final termination notice unless it\nhas, during that time, issued a new termination notice that complies with\nparagraph (b)(1) of this section or has updated the original notice to include\nthe current arrears. (6)\nA utility\nmay not terminate service while a complaint is pending before the utility or\nthe commission and for 15 calendar days after resolution by the utility or by\nthe commission or its designee, for nonpayment of the disputed charges as\nprovided in section\n12.3\nof this Title. Nothing in\nthis Part prevents the utility from terminating service for nonpayment of\nundisputed charges. (7)\nA utility\nmay not terminate service during a two-week period encompassing Christmas and\n\nNew Year's Day. (d) Rapid posting of payments. Every utility must establish and implement written\nprocedures to ensure that any payments made in response to a final termination\nnotice, when the customer brings the fact that such a notice has been issued to\nthe attention of the utility or its authorized agents: (1)\nare posted to the customer's account on\nthe day payment is received; or\n(2)\nare processed in some manner so that termination will not occur. (e) Payment at the time of\ntermination of service. (1)\n\nIf a customer\nclaims, at the time that termination for nonpayment is to take place, that\npayment has already been made and produces a written business record of\npayment, or claims that there is a complaint pending before the utility or the\ncommission with regard to the charges demanded, the utility's field\nrepresentative must make a reasonable effort to verify this information with a\nutility office representative and must not terminate service for nonpayment of\nany verified disputed amount. (2)\n\nAt the time of termination, if payment of the full amount that forms the basis\nfor a scheduled termination is offered, or if a customer agrees to sign a\npayment agreement in accordance with section\n14.10\nof this Part and offers\npayment of any required downpayment, the utility representative must not\nterminate service. The utility representative may either accept payment or\nallow the customer an extension of time of not less than one business day to go\nto a business office to make payment or arrange for payment. However, if the\ncustomer fails to make payment or arrange for payment within the specified\ntime, the utility may terminate service without further notice. (3)\n\nIf a customer has, within the last 12\nmonths, paid for service with a check that was dishonored, the utility has the\nright to accept only cash, certified check, or money order as payment from that\ncustomer under paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nWhenever payment is made at the time of\ntermination, the utility's field representative must provide the customer with\na receipt showing the date, the account number, the amount received, the form\nof the payment and either the name or identification number of the utility\nrepresentative. (f) Dishonored checks. Receipt of a subsequently dishonored check, in response to a\ntermination notice, is not payment of a customer's account and the utility is\nnot required to issue additional notice before termination, as long as the\nfinal termination notice warns the customer of this, in accordance with\nsubparagraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section. (g) Applicability. Nothing in this section\naffects a utility's right to suspend, curtail or disconnect service: (1)\nwhen there is no customer and service is\nbeing provided through tampered equipment; (2)\nwhen there is no customer and the utility\nhas provided advance written notice to the occupant, either by posting or\nmailing not more than 30 nor less than 10 calendar days before disconnection, stating: (i) that it intends to disconnect\nservice unless the responsible party applies for service and is accepted as a\ncustomer; and\n(ii)\nthe location of\nthe nearest utility business office where application can be made; or\n(3)\nas permitted under section\n14.17\nof this Part.
