  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 8C.09 - Traffic Control Signals at or Near Highway-Rail Grade Crossings\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraph 01. INSERT the following paragraphs: Standard: 02A The location of traffic signal heads at highway-rail\ngrade crossings shall conform to all applicable design requirements for traffic\ncontrol signals, except as modified in below. Standard: 02B Any hardware within 8 feet-6 inches of the track\ncenterline shall be at least 22 feet above the top of the highest rail. Guidance: 02C All signal heads should be located at least 12 feet\nfrom any track center line, measured along the highway. Option: 03A When approved by the New York State Department of\n\nTransportation, traffic control signals may be used as the sole control device\nat non-mainline highway-rail grade crossings where rail traffic is not required\nto stop before entering the crossing. Guidance: 03B The following general descriptions are for steady mode\n(stop-and-go) traffic signal operations at highway-rail grade crossings. Operations at particular locations should generally conform to the principles\nstated in this Section, but may be adapted to fit conditions at these\nlocations, as approved by the New York State Department of\n\nTransportation. Standard: 03C At highway-rail grade crossings where railroad\nflashing-light signals are not installed and traffic control signals are used\nto control highway traffic at the highway-rail grade crossing, at least one\ntrain approach face shall be installed on each approach, each signal face\nconsisting of a 12-inch minimum diameter circular red indication and a 12-inch\nminimum diameter circular yellow indication The traffic control signals and the\nrailroad circuitry controlling the train movements at the crossing shall be\ninterconnected. 03D Where installed, train approach faces shall rest in red\nuntil the train is detected by the railroad circuitry. When activated by\napproaching rail traffic, the traffic signal faces shall display appropriate\nindications to prohibit vehicular movements over the crossing and the train\napproach faces shall display steady yellow indications. The signal shall remain\nin this phase until the train has cleared the grade crossing and, at\ntermination of the railroad phase, revert to normal operation. Guidance: 03E Where practicable, the train approach face should be\nlocated on the right side of the train approach. Support: 03F Where a track crosses closely spaced roadways (for\nexample, the two roadways of a divided highway), it is normally necessary to\nprovide train approach faces only in advance of the first roadway in each\ndirection. Guidance: 03G Where the operation is such that trains do not cross\nall the roadways in one signal phase, installation of separate train faces at\neach roadway should be considered. Guidance: 03H Where train traffic is required to stop before\nproceeding over the crossing, a STOP (R1-1) sign should be placed adjacent to\nthe tracks facing each train approach at the limit of the railroad circuitry\ncontrolling train movements at the crossing, if installed. If the crossing has\nno railroad circuitry controlling train movements at the crossing, the STOP\nsign should be located between 50 and 100 feet from the crossing. Standard: 03I A traffic control signal at a coincident crossing shall\nnormally operate in a steady (stop-and-go) mode, allocating right-of-way among\nhighway traffic approaches. The traffic control signal shall be interconnected\nwith railroad circuitry and with railroad flashing-light signals and gates, where these devices are installed. 03J When a traffic control signal is used at a coincident\ncrossing, and railroad flashing-light signals are not installed, at least one\nof the primary vehicular signal faces for each approach shall be located so\nthat it is visible to approaching highway traffic while a train occupies the\ncrossing. 03K When a traffic control signal used at a coincident\ncrossing is placed in flashing operation and railroad flashing-light signals\nare installed, the traffic control signal shall display a steady red indication\nwhen the train is detected by the railroad circuitry so as not to be in\nconflict with the indications displayed by railroad flashing-light signals. The\ntrain approach faces, if installed, shall display steady red indications during\nflashing operation of the traffic control signal. 03L When a traffic control signal is used at a coincident\ncrossing, it shall provide appropriate change interval displays for the\ntransition from normal operation to the railroad phase. 03M When a traffic control signal is used at a proximate\ncrossing, and railroad flashing-light signals are not installed, at least two\nvehicular signal faces, in addition to any used at the highway intersection, shall be located in advance of the highway-rail grade crossing, facing traffic\napproaching the intersection. The faces shall be located at or beyond the stop\nline and shall be located laterally in accordance with Chapter 4D. Guidance: 03N Where a traffic control signal is located at an\nintersection, the choice of control at a proximate crossing should consider\nsuch factors as the geometric relationship between the crossing and the\nintersection, the nature of the crossing (mainline or siding), rail and\nvehicular traffic volumes and speeds, queue lengths, vehicle mix, accident\nhistory, and other pertinent factors. 03O Where the adjacent intersection is not signalized, a\nproximate crossing should be treated as an independent crossing. Option: 03P Traffic control signal faces may also be located at the\ncrossing to control traffic leaving the intersection. Guidance: 03Q Displays in the traffic control signal faces in advance\nof and beyond the crossing should be timed to allow highway traffic to clear\nthe crossing prior to arrival of any rail traffic. Standard: 03R Where a proximate crossing is controlled by both\ntraffic control signals and railroad flashing-light signals, train approach\nsignals shall not be required. The traffic control signals shall normally\noperate in a steady (stop-and-go) mode, allocating right-of-way among the\nhighway traffic approaches, and the railroad flashing-light signals are\nactivated only when a train is detected by the railroad circuitry. The traffic\ncontrol signals shall be interconnected with the railroad circuitry, and upon\ndetection, transition to steady red indications. Train approach signals, if\ninstalled, shall, upon detection, transition to steady yellow indications. At\nthe termination of the railroad phase, the signals shall revert to normal\noperation. 03S When a traffic control signal is used at an independent\ncrossing, and railroad flashing-light signals are not installed, at least two\nvehicular signal faces shall be located on each approach to the grade crossing. The faces shall be located at, or beyond the stop line and shall be located\nlaterally in accordance with Chapter 4D. 03T A traffic control signal at an independent crossing\nshall normally display either circular green or circular flashing yellow\nindications in the highway faces and circular red indications in the train\napproach faces. Upon train actuation, the highway faces shall transition to red\nindications and the train approach faces shall transition to circular yellow\nindications. If the highway faces normally display flashing yellow indications, a green interval of at least 4 seconds shall precede the clearance to the\nrailroad phase. At the termination of the railroad phase, the traffic control\nsignal shall revert to normal operation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n8C.09\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
