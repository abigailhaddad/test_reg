Tit. 10 §§ 58-3.7 - Gross annual receipts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A laboratory which has no gross annual receipts to report because it did not operate in New York State the previous permit year shall pay a first year accreditation fee of $1,000 regardless of the number of months remaining in the permit year. When applying for renewal of that permit, the laboratory shall report its gross receipts for the calendar months in which it operated and these receipts shall be projected to a 12-month basis for the purpose of computing gross annual receipts. (b) A laboratory which has no permit, but accepted business which required it to have a New York State permit, had gross annual receipts in the previous permit year, and applies for a permit after commencement of the permit year shall pay a fee computed as an annual fee but prorated for the months remaining in the permit year, or $1,000, whichever is greater.
