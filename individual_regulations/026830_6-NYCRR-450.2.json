Tit. 6 § 450.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following terms used in Parts 450-454 of this Title\nshall have the meanings indicated: (a) A-weighted sound level shall mean the sound pressure level measured by the use\nof an instrument with the metering characteristics and A-weighting frequency\nresponse prescribed for sound level meters. (b) Ambulance. Every motor vehicle designed, appropriately equipped and used for the purpose of carrying sick or injured\npersons. (c) Authorized emergency\nvehicle. Every ambulance, police vehicle, fire vehicle and civil defense\nemergency vehicle. (d) Civil\ndefense emergency vehicle.

(e) Combination of vehicles shall mean any\ndevice consisting of a motor vehicle and one or more trailers drawn by such\nmotor vehicle. (f) dB(A) means the\nstandard abbreviation for A-weighted sound level in decibels. (g) Fast meter response means that the fast\ndynamic response of the sound level meter shall be used. The fast dynamic\nresponse shall comply with the meter dynamic characteristics in paragraph 5.3\nof the American National Standards Specification for Sound Level Meters, ANSI\nS1.4-1971. This publication is available from the American National Standards\n\nInstitute, Inc., 1430 Broadway, New York, 10018. (h) Fire vehicle. Every vehicle operated for\nfire service purposes owned and identified as being owned by the State, a\npublic authority, a county, town, city, village or fire district, or a fire\ncorporation subject to the provisions of subdivision (e) of section\n1402\nof the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law\nor a fire company as defined in section\n100\nof\nthe General Municipal Law.

(i) Gross weight. The weight of a vehicle\nwithout load plus the weight of any load thereon. (j) Ground cover means any of various low, dense-growing plants, such as ivy, myrtle, low weeds or brush. (k) Hard test site means any test site having\nthe ground surface covered with concrete, asphalt, packed dirt, gravel or\nsimilar reflective material for more than one-half the distance between the\nmicrophone target point and the microphone location point. (l) Maximum gross weight. The weight of the\nvehicle unladen plus the weight of the maximum load to be carried by such\nvehicle during the registration period, or the maximum gross weight for which\nthe vehicle is registered, whichever is greater. (m) Motor vehicle. Every vehicle operated or\ndriven upon a public highway which is propelled by any power other than\nmuscular power, except (a) electrically driven invalid chairs being operated or\ndriven by an invalid, (b) vehicles which run only upon rails or tracks, and (c)\nsnowmobiles as defined in article 47 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. (n) Open site means an area that is\nessentially free of large sound-reflecting objects, such as barriers, walls, board fences, signboards, parked vehicles, bridges or buildings. (o) Relatively flat, when used to describe a\nnoise measurement site, means a site which does not contain significant concave\ncurvatures or slope reversals that may result in the focusing of sound waves\ntoward the microphone location point. (p) Soft test site means any test site having\nthe ground surface covered with grass, other ground cover, or similar\nabsorptive material for one-half or more of the distance between the microphone\ntarget point and the microphone location point. (q) Sound level means the quantity in\ndecibels measured by a sound level meter satisfying the requirements of\n\nAmerican National Standards Specification for Sound Level Meters, S1.4-1971. This publication is available from the American National Standards Institute, Inc., 1430 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10018. Sound level is the\nfrequency-weighted sound pressure level obtained with the standardized dynamic\ncharacteristic \"fast\" or \"slow\" and weighting A, B or C; unless indicated\notherwise, the A-weighting is understood\n(r) Sound pressure level shall mean 20 times\nthe logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the root mean squared pressure of\na sound to a reference pressure of 20 micropascals. The unit applied to this\nmeasure shall be the decibel (dB). (s) Traffic railing means any longitudinal\nhighway traffic barrier system installed along the side or median of a highway. For the purpose of this Part, a traffic railing must have at least 35 percent\nof its vertical height, from the ground surface to the top of the railing, open\nto free space in order to qualify as an acceptable object within a noise\nmeasurement test site. Further, for the purposes of this Part, posts or other\ndiscrete supports shall be ignored when ascertaining open free space. (t) Trailer. Any vehicle not propelled by its\nown power, drawn on the public highways by a motor vehicle operated thereon, except motorcycle sidecars, vehicles being towed by a nonrigid support and\nvehicles designed and primarily used for other purposes and only occasionally\ndrawn by such a motor vehicle.
