  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 665.8 - Variances from statewide minimum land-use regulations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In accordance with subdivision 24-0903.2\nof the act, a local government that has assumed regulatory authority pursuant\nto this Part may submit within six months of receipt, and then annually to the\ncommissioner a proposed variance from the statewide minimum land-use\nregulations in section\n665.7\n(g) of this\n\nPart to govern wetlands within its boundaries. (b) Such a proposed variance must be\nconsistent with the purposes of the act and may be more or less restrictive\nthan the statewide minimum land-use regulations. Where less restrictive, the\nproposed variance must be accompanied by supporting material setting forth, among other things, that there are overriding economic and social\nconsiderations vital to the growth and economic base of the local government\nthat clearly require such variance. (c) The commissioner must hold a public\nhearing in the area in which the affected wetlands are located, after giving 15\ndays prior notice of the hearing by publishing at least once in a newspaper\nhaving general circulation in the area of the local government proposing a\nvariance. Notice of the proposed variance must be published as a notice of\nproposed agency action in the State Register. (d) If the commissioner approves the\nvariance, he must promulgate the local variance as an amendment to the\nstatewide minimum land-use regulations within 30 days of the hearing and after\npublishing a notice at least once in two newspapers having general circulation\nin the area of the local government concerned and make the variance available\nfor public inspection and review. The variance does not take effect until the\nnotice and review requirements of the State Administrative Procedure Act have\nbeen satisfied and the amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State and\nuntil 30 days after its filing with the clerk of the county in which the local\ngovernment is located. (e) If the\ncommissioner does not approve the variance, any person aggrieved by that\ndecision may seek review pursuant to section\n665.14\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n665.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
