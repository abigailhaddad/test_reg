  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 145-2.5 - In-State study\n\nState Regulations\n\nTo be considered in attendance at a school in New York\n\nState, the student must either be matriculated at that school, or must be\nregistered at that school under permit from another school in New York State at\nwhich the student is regularly matriculated. A student who is regularly\nmatriculated at an out-of-state school and who attends a New York State school\nwithout full transfer and matriculation shall be considered as an out-of-state\nstudent. (b) Instruction received by a\nstudent outside New York State may be considered as instruction conducted by an\ninstitution in this State, within the intent of the law, only if the student is\nrequired to pay all tuition and instructional fees for such foreign or\nout-of-state study to the approved New York State institution. To be approved, an off-campus study program must be an integral part of the curriculum of the\n\nNew York State institution, and tuition must be payable to the school and\nreceived by the school in the same manner as tuition charged for any other\nschool program. If the student pays tuition or educational fees to an\nout-of-state institution, the student shall be considered as receiving\ninstruction provided by that institution, notwithstanding the fact that the\nstudent may be maintaining registration in a New York State institution, or\nthat the New York State institution may also be charging the student a fee for\nsupervisory, guidance, or administrative services. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§§\n145-2.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
