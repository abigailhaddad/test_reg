  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 704.2 - Criteria governing thermal discharges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General criteria. The following criteria\nshall apply to all waters of the State receiving thermal discharges, except as\nprovided in section\n704.6\nof this Part: (1)\n\nThe natural seasonal cycle shall be\nretained. (2)\n\nAnnual spring and\nfall temperature changes shall be gradual. (3)\n\nLarge day-to-day temperature fluctuations\ndue to heat of artificial origin shall be avoided. (4)\n\nDevelopment or growth of nuisance\norganisms shall not occur in contravention of water quality\nstandards. (5)\n\nDischarges which\nwould lower receiving water temperature shall not cause a violation of water\nquality standards and section\n704.3\nof this Part. (6)\n\nFor the protection of the aquatic biota\nfrom severe temperature changes, routine shut down of an entire thermal\ndischarge at any site shall not be scheduled during the period from December\nthrough March. (b) Special criteria. The following criteria shall apply to all waters of the State\nreceiving thermal discharges, except as provided in section\n704.6\nof this Part: (1)\n\nNontrout waters. (i) The water temperature at the surface of a\nstream shall not be raised to more than 90 degrees Fahrenheit at any\npoint. (ii)\n\nAt least 50 percent of\nthe cross sectional area and/or volume of flow of the stream including a\nminimum of one-third of the surface as measured from shore to shore shall not\nbe raised to more than five Fahrenheit degrees over the temperature that\nexisted before the addition of heat of artificial origin or to a maximum of 86\ndegrees Fahrenheit whichever is less. (iii)\n\nAt least 50 percent of the cross\nsectional area and/or volume of flow of the stream including a minimum of\none-third of the surface as measured from shore to shore shall not be lowered\nmore than five Fahrenheit degrees from the temperature that existed immediately\nprior to such lowering. (2)\n\nTrout waters (T or TS). (i) No discharge at a temperature over 70\ndegrees Fahrenheit shall be permitted at any time to streams classified for\ntrout. (ii)\n\nFrom June through\n\nSeptember no discharge shall be permitted that will raise the temperature of\nthe stream more than two Fahrenheit degrees over that which existed before the\naddition of heat of artificial origin. (iii)\n\nFrom October through May no discharge\nshall be permitted that will raise the temperature of the stream more than five\n\nFahrenheit degrees over that which existed before the addition of heat of\nartificial origin or to a maximum of 50 degrees Fahrenheit whichever is\nless. (iv)\n\nFrom June through\n\nSeptember no discharge shall be permitted that will lower the temperature of\nthe stream more than two Fahrenheit degrees from that which existed immediately\nprior to such lowering. (3)\n\nLakes. (i) The water temperature at the surface of a\nlake shall not be raised more than three Fahrenheit degrees over the\ntemperature that existed before the addition of heat of artificial\norigin. (ii)\n\nIn lakes subject to\nstratification as defined in Part 652 of this Title, thermal discharges that\nwill raise the temperature of the receiving waters shall be confined to the\nepilimnion. (iii)\n\nIn lakes subject\nto stratification as defined in Part 652 of this Title, thermal discharges that\nwill lower the temperature of the receiving waters shall be discharged to the\nhypolimnion and shall meet the water quality standards contained in Part 703 of\nthis Title in all respects. (4)\n\nCoastal waters. (i) The water temperature at the surface of\ncoastal waters shall not be raised more than four Fahrenheit degrees from\n\nOctober through June nor more than 1.5 Fahrenheit degrees from July through\n\nSeptember over that which existed before the addition of heat of artificial\norigin. (ii)\n\nThe water temperature\nat the surface of coastal waters shall not be lowered more than four Fahrenheit\ndegrees from October through June nor more than 1.5 Fahrenheit degrees from\n\nJuly through September from that which existed immediately prior to such\nlowering. (5)\n\nEstuaries\nor portions of estuaries. (i) The water\ntemperature at the surface of an estuary shall not be raised to more than 90\ndegrees Fahrenheit at any point. (ii)\n\nAt least 50 percent of the cross\nsectional area and/or volume of the flow of the estuary including a minimum of\none-third of the surface as measured from water edge to water edge at any stage\nof tide, shall not be raised to more than four Fahrenheit degrees over the\ntemperature that existed before the addition of heat of artificial origin or a\nmaximum of 83 degrees Fahrenheit whichever is less. (iii)\n\nFrom July through September, if the\nwater temperature at the surface of an estuary before the addition of heat of\nartificial origin is more than 83 degrees Fahrenheit an increase in temperature\nnot to exceed 1.5 Fahrenheit degrees at any point of the estuarine passageway\nas delineated above, may be permitted. (iv)\n\nAt least 50 percent of the cross\nsectional area and/or volume of the flow of the estuary including a minimum of\none-third of the surface as measured from water edge to water edge at any stage\nof tide, shall not be lowered more than four Fahrenheit degrees from the\ntemperature that existed immediately prior to such lowering. (6)\n\nEnclosed bays. No additional\ntemperature change except that which occurs naturally shall be permitted in\nenclosed bays. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n704.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
