  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.117 - SMOKE Sign (NYW7-17)\n\nState Regulations\n\nOption: 01 The SMOKE (NYW7-17) sign (see Sign Drawing SD-W24) may\nbe used, as necessary, to warn of locations where smoke from brush fires or\nforest fires drifts across the roadway. 02 The SMOKE sign may be supplemented with an Advisory\n\nSpeed plaque (see Section\n2C.08\n), where appropriate. Where\nsmoke drifts intermittently across the road for a distance of 1000 feet or\nmore, the SMOKE sign may be supplemented with a Distance plaque (see Section\n2C.55\n). Guidance: 03 The SMOKE sign should be removed as soon as the smoke is\nno longer present. 04 Where the SMOKE sign is supplemented with both a\n\nDistance plaque and an Advisory Speed plaque, the Distance plaque should be\nplaced above the Advisory Speed plaque. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.117\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
