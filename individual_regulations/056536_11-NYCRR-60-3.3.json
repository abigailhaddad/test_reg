(e) (1)\n\nWith regard to an individual policy, a provision that the policy shall afford bodily injury and property damage liability insurance for: (i) any other vehicle of which the named insured acquires ownership, leases, or otherwise is authorized to use provided it replaces the TNC vehicle described in the policy or the company insures all automobiles owned by the named insured or his spouse on the delivery date; (ii)\nany motor vehicle, used with the permission of the owner, and not owned by the named insured or his or her spouse or any resident of the same household, which is temporarily substituted for the said motor vehicle while withdrawn from service because of breakdown, servicing, repair, loss or destruction; or\n(iii)\nthe incidental use of a motor vehicle not owned by the named insured or a member of the insured's household, nor furnished or available for their regular use, provided the actual operation or other actual use thereof is with the permission of the owner and is within the scope of such permission. (2)\n\nWith regard to a group policy, a provision that the group policy shall afford bodily injury and property damage liability insurance for: (i) any other vehicle of which the insured acquires ownership, leases, or otherwise is authorized to use provided it replaces the insured's TNC vehicle described in the policy; (ii)\nany motor vehicle, used with the permission of the owner, and not owned by the insured or his or her spouse or any resident of the same household, which is temporarily substituted for the TNC vehicle while withdrawn from service because of breakdown, servicing, repair, loss or destruction; or\n(iii)\nthe incidental use of a motor vehicle not owned by the named insured or a member of the insured's household, nor furnished or available for their regular use, provided the actual operation or other actual use thereof is with the permission of the owner and is within the scope of such permission. (3)\n\nWith regard to an individual policy, a provision required by paragraphs (1) of this subdivision need not apply: (i) to any accident arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle by a person employed or otherwise engaged in the business of a motor vehicle sales agency, repair shop, service station, storage garage or public parking place; or\n(ii)\nwith respect to a newly acquired motor vehicle, to any loss against which the driver has other valid and collectible insurance in satisfaction of Vehicle and Traffic Law article 44-B. (4)\n\nWith regard to a group policy, a provision required by paragraph (2) of this subdivision need not apply to any accident arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle by a person employed or otherwise engaged in the business of a motor vehicle sales agency, repair shop, service station, storage garage or public parking place. (f) A provision that when a motor vehicle is used or operated in any other state or Canadian province, a policy currently in effect or hereafter issued shall provide at least the minimum amount and kind of coverage that is required in such cases under the laws of such other jurisdiction. Any policy not containing such provision shall nevertheless be deemed to provide such coverage. This provision is not intended to create a duplication of coverage or benefits to the extent that a New York insured carries additional coverages under any automobile or motor vehicle insurance policy or is covered under an automobile or motor vehicle policy of a resident of the jurisdiction wherein an injury occurs. (g) A provision that the insurer will not provide coverage for any insured who intentionally causes, or directs another person to cause, bodily injury or property damage. (h) Either of the following provisions: (1)\n\nThe insurer shall not be liable for a greater proportion of the loss than the applicable limit of liability of the policy bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all other valid and collectible insurance covering the insured against such loss; provided, however, with respect to a TNC vehicle, other than a newly acquired motor vehicle, for which insurance is provided under subdivision (d) of this section, the insurance shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance. (2)\n\nThe insurance afforded by this policy is primary insurance, except when stated to apply in excess of or contingent upon the absence of other insurance. When this insurance is primary and the insured has other insurance that is stated to be applicable to the loss on an excess or contingent basis, the amount of the company's liability under this policy shall not be reduced by the existence of such other insurance. When both this insurance and other insurance apply to the loss on the same basis, whether primary, excess or contingent, the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of the loss than that stated in the applicable contribution provision below: (i) Contribution by equal shares. If all of such other valid and collectible insurance provides for contribution by equal shares, the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than would be payable if each insurer contributes an equal share until the share of each insurer equals the lowest applicable limit of liability under any one policy or the full amount of the loss is paid, and with respect to any amount of loss not so paid the remaining insurers then continue to contribute equal shares of the remaining amount of the loss until each such insurer has paid its limit in full or the full amount of the loss is paid. (ii)\n\nContribution by limits. If any of such other insurance does not provide for contribution by equal shares, the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability under this policy for such loss bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss. With respect to the maintenance or use of hired motor vehicles and nonowned motor vehicles, this insurance shall apply only as excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured. (i) (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, a provision that if the insurer cancels the policy, at least 20 days' prior written notice shall be mailed or delivered to the named insured, except where the cancellation is for nonpayment of premium in which case 15 days' notice of cancellation by the insurer shall be sufficient. (2)\n\nIf the article 44-B policy is a group policy and the insurer cancels the policy, then the insurer must provide written notice in conformance with Insurance Law section 3455. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
