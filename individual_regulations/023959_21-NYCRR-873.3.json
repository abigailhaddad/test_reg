  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 873.3 - Technical standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Standards used by State and local governments shall conform in principle to\ncommission standards, but may vary in detail provided that resulting flood\nplain use will not be less restrictive than would result from the application\nof commission standards. The commission will review proposed State and local\nflood plain regulations to determine their compliance with commission\nstandards. (b) Because of the\nvariety and diversity of presently recognized hydrologic procedures, no one\nprocedure or method is prescribed for determining the peak flow in cubic feet\nper second for the 100-year storm (Q 100) on which profiles for the delineation\nof flood hazard areas are based. The following may be used: (1)\nA Uniform Technique for Determining Flood\n\nFlow Frequencies, Bulletin No. 15, Water Resources Council, December\n1967. (2)\n\nBasin-Wide Program for\n\nFlood Plain Delineation, Delaware River Basin Commission, Anderson-Nichols\n& Co., Inc., June 1973. (3)\n\nMagnitude and Frequency of Floods in New Jersey with Effects of Urbanization, Special Report 38 U.S.G.S., New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, 1974. (4)\n\nGuidelines for\n\nDetermining Flood Flow Frequency, Bulletin No. 17, Water Resources Council, March 1976. State and local agencies may use methods resulting in Q\n100's which are in reasonable agreement with those of the commission. Any\nsignificant difference shall be reviewed with and subject to approval by the\nexecutive director. (c) Methods and procedures shall be uniform, so far as practicable, within subbasins which have a major effect on the larger\nbasins of which they are a part. To assist in achieving this objective, the\ncommission staff will periodically provide to the various interested\ngovernmental agencies and others Q 100 data as developed by the Delaware River\n\nBasin Commission Hydrology Coordinating Committee for key locations in the\n\nDelaware River Basin. These will be based on a Log Pearson Type 3 analysis of\ndata from the U.S.G.S. gaging stations using station skew, regional skew, or\nweighted skew, depending on the scope of data at each\nstation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n873.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
