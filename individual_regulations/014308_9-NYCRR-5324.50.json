(4)\n\nAs an alternative to using the shaker and\ndice described in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, a gaming facility may\ndetermine the starting position for the dealing or delivery of the tiles in pai\ngow by using a computerized random number generator that automatically selects\nand displays a number from one through eight, inclusive, as set forth in\nsubdivision (c) of section\n5324.2\nof this Part. (5)\n\nPai gow shall be played with a set of 32\nrectangular blocks to be known as tiles. Each tile in a set shall be identical\nin size and shading to every other tile in the set. (b) Pai gow Tiles; ranking of hands, pairs\nand tiles; value of the hand. (1)\n\nWhen\ncomparing high hands or low hands to determine the higher ranking hand, the\ndetermination shall first be based upon the rank of any permissible pair of\ntiles that are contained in the hands. A hand with any permissible pair of\ntiles shall rank higher than a hand that does not contain any permissible pair. The permissible pairs of tiles in pai gow and their rank, with the supreme pair\nbeing the highest or first ranking pair, are as follows: Ranking\n\nPairing\n\nSupreme pair first\n6 (2-4) and 3 (1-2)\n\nMatched pairs\n\nSecond\n12 (6-6) and 12 (6-6)\n\nThird\n2 (1-1) and 2 (1-1)\n\nFourth\n8 (4-4) and 8 (4-4)\n\nFifth\n4 (1-3) and 4 (1-3)\n\nSixth\n10 (5-5) and 10(5-5)\n\nSeventh\n6 (3-3) and 6 (3-3)\n\nEighth\n4 (2-2) and 4 (2-2)\n\nNinth\n11 (5-6) and 11 (5-6)\n\nTenth\n10 (4-6) and 10(4-6)\n\nEleventh\n7 (1-6) and 7 (1-6)\n\nTwelfth\n6 (1-5) and 6 (1-5)\n\nMixed or unmatched pairs\n\nThirteenth\n\nMixed 9s (3-6 and 4-5)\n\nFourteenth\n\nMixed 8s (3-5 and 2-6)\n\nFifteenth\n\nMixed 7s (3-4 and 2-5)\n\nSixteenth\n\nMixed 5s (1-4 and 2-3)\n\nWongs\n\nSeventeenth\n12 (6-6) and 9 (4-5)\n12 (6-6) and 9 (3-6)\n\nEighteenth\n2 (1-1) and 9 (4-5)\n2 (1-1) and 9 (3-6)\n\nGongs\n\nNineteenth\n12 (6-6) and 8 (2-6)\n12 (6-6) and 8 (3-5)\n12 (6-6) and 8 (4-4)\n\nTwentieth\n2 (1-1) and 8 (2-6)\n2 (1-1) and 8 (3-5)\n2 (1-1) and 8 (4-4)\n(2)\n\nWhen comparing high hands or low hands\nthat are of identical permissible pair rank, the dealer or, if applicable, the\nbank shall win that hand. (3)\n\nWhen\ncomparing the rank of high hands or low hands that do not contain any of the\npairs listed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the higher ranking hand\nshall be determined on the basis of the value of the hands. The value of a hand\nshall be a single digit number from zero to nine inclusive and shall be\ndetermined by adding the total number of spots that are contained on the two\ntiles that form the hand. If the numeric total of the spots is a two-digit\nnumber, the left digit of such number shall be discarded and the right digit\nshall constitute the value of the hand. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, if the tiles that form the supreme pair are\nused separately, the numeric total of the 3 (1-2) may be counted as a 6 and the\nnumeric total of the 6 (2-4) may be counted as a 3. When the 3 (1-2) is counted\nas 6, its individual ranking shall be fifteenth instead of seventeenth and when\nthe 6 (2-4) is counted as 3, its individual ranking shall be seventeenth\ninstead of fifteenth. (5)\n\nWhen\ncomparing high hands or low hands that are of identical value, the hand with\nthe highest-ranking individual tile shall be considered the higher ranking\nhand. (6)\n\nThe individual ranking\nfor each tile, with first representing the highest-ranking, is as follows: Ranking\n\nTile\n\nNumber of tiles in set\n\nFirst\n12 (6-6)\n2\n\nSecond\n2(1-1)\n2\n\nThird\n8 (4-4)\n2\n\nFourth\n4 (1-3)\n2\n\nFifth\n10(5-5)\n2\n\nSixth\n6 (3-3)\n2\n\nSeventh\n4 (2-2)\n2\n\nEighth\n11 (5-6)\n2\n\nNinth\n10(4-6)\n2\n\nTenth\n7 (1-6)\n2\n\nEleventh\n6 (1-5)\n2\n\nTwelfth\n9 (3-6)\n\nTwelfth\n9 (4-5)\n\nThirteenth\n8 (2-6)\n\nThirteenth\n8 (3-5)\n\nFourteenth\n7 (2-5)\n\nFourteenth\n7 (3-4)\n\nFifteenth\n6 (2-4)\n\nSixteenth\n5 (1-4)\n\nSixteenth\n5 (2-3)\n\nSeventeenth\n3 (1-2)\n(7)\n\nIf the highest-ranking tile in each hand\nbeing compared is of identical rank, the hand shall be considered a copy hand, and the hand of the dealer or bank, as applicable, shall be considered the\nhigher-ranking hand. (c) Wagers. (1)\n\nAll wagers at pai gow shall be\nmade by placing chips, plaques and, if applicable, table game promotional\ncoupons on the appropriate betting area of the pai gow layout. (2)\n\nOnly players who are seated at the pai\ngow table may place a wager at the game. Once a player has placed a wager and\nreceived tiles, that player shall remain seated until the completion of the\nround of play. (3)\n\nAll wagers at\npai gow shall be placed prior to the dealer announcing \"no more bets\" in\naccordance with the dealing procedures set forth in subdivision (e) of this\nsection. No wager at pai gow shall be made, increased or withdrawn after the\ndealer has announced \"no more bets.\"\n(d) Opening of the table for gaming; shuffling procedures. (1)\n\nAfter receiving one\nset of tiles at the table, the dealer shall sort and inspect the tiles and the\nfloorperson assigned to the table shall verify the inspection. Nothing in this\nsection shall preclude a gaming facility from cleaning the tiles prior to the\ninspection required in this section. Tiles shall be inspected and removed from\nuse pursuant to section\n5322.13\nof this Subchapter and this\nparagraph. (i) Each set shall be sorted into\npairs in order to assure that the supreme pair and all 15 matched and unmatched\npairs as identified in paragraph (6) of subdivision (b) of this section are in\nthe set. (ii)\n\nEach tile shall be\nplaced side by side in order to determine that all tiles are the same size and\nshading. (iii)\n\nThe back and sides\nof each tile shall be examined to assure that such tile is not flawed, scratched or marked in any way. (2)\n\nFollowing the inspection of the tiles and\nthe verification by the floorperson assigned to the table, the tiles shall be\nturned face up, then placed into 16 pairs and arranged according to rank\nstarting with the supreme pair. The tiles shall be left in pairs for visual\ninspection by the first player to arrive at the table. (3)\n\nAfter the first player is afforded an\nopportunity visually to inspect the tiles, the tiles shall be turned face down\non the table, mixed thoroughly by a washing of the tiles and stacked. (4)\n\nThe dealer shall perform the wash or\nshuffle of the tiles with the heels of the palms of the dealer's hands in a\ncircular motion with one hand moving clockwise and the other hand moving\ncounter-clockwise. Each hand shall complete at least eight circular motions in\norder to provide a random shuffle. The dealer shall then randomly pick up four\ntiles with each hand and place them side by side in stacks in front of the chip\ntray, forming eight stacks of four tiles. (5)\n\nIf during the stacking process described\nin paragraph (3) of this subdivision, a tile is turned over and exposed to the\nplayers, the entire set of tiles shall be re-shuffled. (6)\n\nAfter each completed round of play, the\ndealer shall turn all of the tiles face down and shuffle the tiles in\naccordance with paragraph (4) of this subdivision. (7)\n\nIf there is no gaming activity at the pai\ngow table, the tiles shall be turned face up and placed into 16 pairs according\nto rank starting with the supreme pair. Once a player arrives at the table, the\nprocedures in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subdivision shall be\nfollowed. (e) Procedures\nfor dealing the tiles. (1)\n\nOnce the dealer\nhas completed shuffling the tiles, the dealer shall announce \"no more bets\"\nprior to shaking the pai gow shaker. The dealer shall then shake the pai gow\nshaker at least three times. (2)\n\nThe dealer shall then remove the lid covering the pai gow shaker, total the\ndice and announce the total. The total of the dice shall determine which player\nreceives the first stack of tiles. (3)\n\nTo determine the starting position for\ndealing the tiles, the dealer shall count counter-clockwise around the table, with the position of the dealer considered number one and continuing around the\ntable with each betting position, regardless of whether there is a wager at the\nposition, and the dead hand counted in order until the count matches the total\nof the three dice. (4)\n\nThe dealer\nshall deal the first stack of four tiles, starting from the right side of the\neight stacks, to the starting position as determined in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision and, moving counter-clockwise around the table, deal all other\npositions including the dead hand and the dealer a stack of tiles, without\nregard to whether there is a wager at the position. The dealer shall place a\nmarker on top of the dealer's stack of tiles immediately after the tiles are\ndealt. (5)\n\nAfter all the stacks of\ntiles have been dealt, the dealer shall, without exposing the tiles, collect\nany stacks dealt to a position where there is no wager and place the stacks\nwith the dead hand on the layout in front of the chip tray. (6)\n\nOnce all tiles have been dealt and any\ntiles dealt to positions with no wagers have been collected, the dealer shall\nplace the cover on the pai gow shaker and shake once. The pai gow shaker then\nshall be placed to the right of the dealer. (f) Procedures for completion of each round\nof play; setting of hands; payment and collection of wagers; payout odds; vigorish. (1)\n\nAfter the dealing of the tiles\nhas been completed, each player shall set such player's hands by arranging the\ntiles into a high hand and low hand. After setting the hands, the tiles shall\nbe placed face down on the layout immediately behind that player's betting area\nand separated into a high hand and low hand. (2)\n\nEach player at the table shall be\nresponsible for setting such player's own hands and no other person except the\ndealer may touch the tiles of such player. Each player shall keep the four\ntiles in full view of the dealer at all times. Once each player has set a high\nhand and low hand and placed the two hands face down on the layout, the player\nshall not touch the tiles again. (3)\n\nAfter all players have set their hands\nand placed the tiles on the table, the four tiles of the dealer shall be turned\nover and the dealer shall set the dealer's hands by arranging the tiles into a\nhigh hand and low hand. The high hand shall be placed on the layout face up to\nthe dealer's right and the low hand shall be placed on the layout face up to\nthe dealer's left. If banking or co-banking is in effect pursuant to\nsubdivision (g) of this section, after all players have set their hands and\nplaced the tiles on the table, the player banking the game shall turn over such\nplayer's four tiles and shall set the two hands by arranging the tiles in a\nhigh and low hand on the appropriate area of the layout. (4)\n\nThe dealer shall comply with the\nfollowing when setting the hands of the dealer unless otherwise approved by the\ncommission in writing: (i) If the dealer has\nthe supreme pair, such tiles shall be played as such; (ii)\nthe dealer shall always play a pair, wong or gong; (iii)\nthe dealer shall\nplay any two tiles together that have a value equal to 9, 8 or 7; and\n(iv)\nthe dealer shall play the highest-ranking\ntile with the lowest-ranking tile. (5)\nA player may surrender a wager after the\nhands of the dealer have been set. The player shall announce an intention to\nsurrender prior to the dealer exposing either of the two hands of that player\npursuant to paragraph (7) of this subdivision. Once the player has announced an\nintention to surrender, the dealer shall: (i) immediately collect the wager from such player; and\n(ii)\ncollect the four tiles dealt to such\nplayer and stack such tiles face down in front of the chip tray without\nexposing the tiles to anyone at the table. (6)\n\nOnce the dealer has set a high hand and\nlow hand, the dealer shall expose both hands of each player, starting with the\nplayer farthest to the right of the dealer and proceeding counter-clockwise\naround the table. The dealer shall always compare the high hand of the player\nto the high hand of the dealer and the low hand of the player to the low hand\nof the dealer and shall announce if the wager of that player is a win, lose or\na push. (7)\n\nAll losing wagers shall\nbe collected by the dealer and put in the chip tray. All losing hands shall\nalso be collected. A wager made by a player shall lose if the high hand of the\nplayer is identical in rank or lower in rank than the high hand of the dealer, and the low hand of the player is identical in rank or lower in rank than the\nlow hand of the dealer or has a value of zero. (8)\n\nIf a wager is a push, the dealer shall\nnot collect or pay the wager, but shall immediately collect the tiles of that\nplayer. A wager made by a player shall be a push if: (i) the high hand of the player is higher in\nrank than the high hand of the dealer, but the low hand of the player is\nidentical in rank to the low hand of the dealer or lower in rank than the low\nhand of the dealer or has a value of zero; or\n(ii)\nthe high hand of the player is identical\nin rank to the high hand of the dealer or lower in rank than the high hand of\nthe dealer, but the low hand of the player is higher in rank than the low hand\nof the dealer. (9)\n\nAll\nwinning hands shall remain face up on the layout. Winning wagers shall be paid\nafter all hands have been exposed. The dealer shall pay winning wagers\nbeginning with the player farthest to the right of the dealer and continuing\ncounterclockwise around the table. A wager made by a player shall win if the\nhigh hand of the player is higher in rank than the high hand of the dealer and\nthe low hand of the player is higher in rank than the low hand of the\ndealer. (10)\nA winning pai gow\nwager shall be paid by a gaming facility at no less than odds of 1:1, except\nthat a gaming facility shall collect a vigorish from the winning player in an\namount equal to five percent of the amount won; provided, however, that when\ncollecting the vigorish, the gaming facility may round off the vigorish to 25\ncents or the next highest multiple of 25 cents. A gaming facility shall collect\nthe vigorish from a player at the time the winning payout is made. After a\nwinning wager has been paid and the vigorish collected, the dealer shall then\ncollect the tiles from such winning player. (11)\n\nAll tiles collected by the dealer shall\nbe picked up in the order and in such a way that the tiles readily can be\narranged to reconstruct each hand in case of a question or dispute and shall be\nplaced face up in front of the chip tray. (g) Player bank; co-banking; selection of\nbank; procedures for dealing. (1)\nA gaming\nfacility may offer to all players at a pai gow tiles table the opportunity to\nbank the game. If the gaming facility elects to offer the bank the game option, the provisions of this subdivision shall apply. (2)\nA player may not be the bank at the first\nround of play after the dealer is required to restack and shuffle the tiles in\naccordance with the procedures set forth subdivision (e) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nAfter the first round\nof play, each player at the table shall have the option to either be the bank\nor pass the bank to the next player. The dealer shall, starting with the player\nfarthest to the right of the dealer in a counter-clockwise rotation, offer the\nbank to each player until a player accepts the bank. The dealer shall place a\nmarker in front of the player who accepts the bank. If the first player offered\nthe bank accepts, the player seated to the right of such player shall be\noffered the bank first on the next round of play. The initial offer to be the\nbank shall rotate counterclockwise around the table until the offer returns to\nthe dealer. In no event may any player be the bank for two consecutive rounds\nof play. If no player wishes to be the bank, the round of play shall proceed in\naccordance with this section. (4)\n\nBefore a player may be permitted to bank a round of play, the dealer shall\ndetermine that: (i) the player placed a wager\nagainst the dealer during the last round of play in which there was no player\nbanking the game; and\n(ii)\nthe\nplayer has sufficient chips on the table to cover all of the wagers placed by\nother players at the table for that round of play. (5)\nA gaming facility may offer a be-the-bank\noption and have the gaming facility cover 50 percent of the wagers made during\na round of play. If the gaming facility offers such option, the gaming facility\nshall make such option available to all players at the table. If the bank\nwishes to use this option, the bank shall request specifically that the dealer\naccept responsibility for the payment of one-half of all winning wagers. When\nthe bank covers 50 percent and the gaming facility covers 50 percent of the\nwinning wagers, the dealer shall place a marker designating the co-bank in\nfront of such player. When the dealer is co-banking, the dealer shall be\nresponsible for setting the hand of the bank. When co-banking is in effect, the\ndealer may not place a wager against the bank. (6)\n\nIf a player is the bank, the player may\nwager on only one betting area. (7)\n\nOnce the tiles have been shuffled and formed into stacks, the bank shall have\nthe option to cut the tiles one time. If the bank does not wish to cut the\ntiles, there shall be no cut. Upon direction from the bank, the dealer may\nmove: (i) one or more adjacent stacks of four\ntiles to the right or left end of the original eight stacks of tiles; or\n(ii)\ntwo or more adjacent stacks\nof four tiles, of which at least one stack is moved to one end and the other\nstacks are moved to the opposite end of the original eight stacks of\ntiles. (8)\n\nOnce the\ndealer has determined that a player may be the bank pursuant to paragraph (4)\nof this subdivision and the tiles have been shuffled and, cut, the dealer\nshall, unless co-banking is in effect, remove chips from the chip tray in an\namount equal to the last wager made by such player against the dealer or in\nanother amount, which shall be submitted to the commission for approval. This\namount shall be the amount the dealer wagers against the bank. The bank may\ndirect that the sum wagered by the dealer be a lesser amount or that the dealer\nplaces no wager during that round of play. Any amount wagered by the dealer\nshall be placed in front of the chip tray. Upon receipt of the four tiles dealt\nto the dealer pursuant to paragraph (11) of this subdivision, the dealer shall\nplace the dealer's wager on top of these tiles. If co-banking is in effect, the\ndealer shall not remove any chips from the chip tray pursuant to this\nsubdivision. (9)\n\nOnce the dealer\nhas announced \"no more bets,\" the bank may, by issuing a verbal instruction to\nthe dealer, choose to have the dealer deliver the stacks of tiles using any one\nof the 10 styles of delivery set forth in paragraph (11) of this subdivision. If the bank does not choose a style of delivery, the dealer shall use the style\nof delivery called house way from the right, as set forth in subparagraph (i)\nof paragraph (11) of this subdivision. After the style of delivery has been\ndetermined, the dealer verbally shall repeat such, identify the selected style\nof delivery to the gaming facility's surveillance department and move certain\nstacks of tiles or individual tiles slightly forward, backward or diagonally in\nthe manner set forth in subparagraphs (i) through (x) of paragraph (11) of this\nsubdivision. After the dealer verbally has indicated the style of delivery, the\nbank shall shake the pai gow shaker. It shall be the responsibility of the\ndealer to ensure that the bank shakes the pai gow shaker at least three times. Once the bank has completed shaking the pai gow shaker, the dealer shall remove\nthe lid covering the pai gow shaker, total the dice and announce the total. The\ndealer always shall remove the lid from the pai gow shaker and, if the bank\ninadvertently removes the lid, the dealer shall re-cover the pai gow shaker and\nthe pai gow shaker shall be re-shaken by the bank. (10)\n\nTo determine the starting position for\ndealing the tiles, the dealer shall count counter-clockwise around the table, with the position of the bank considered number one and continuing around the\ntable with each betting position, including the dealer, without regard to\nwhether there is a wager at the position, with the dead hand counted in order\nuntil the count matches the total of the three dice. (11)\n\nThe dealer shall deal the first four\ntiles, in accordance with the selected style of delivery set forth in\nsubparagraphs (i) through (x) of this paragraph, to the starting position and, moving counter-clockwise around the table, deal all other positions including\nthe dead hand and the dealer's four tiles, without regard to whether there is a\nwager at the position. The dealer shall place the dealer's wager or marker, as\napplicable, on top of the dealer's stack of tiles immediately after the tiles\nare dealt.
