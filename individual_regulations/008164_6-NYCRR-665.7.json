  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 665.7 - Standards for issuance of permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All persons proposing to conduct activities on wetlands or adjacent areas that\nhave not been specifically exempted from regulation under section 24-0701 of\nthe act or section\n665.2\n(x)(1)-(3)\nof\nthis Part must obtain either a permit or a letter of permission. (b) The permit applicant or a person\nrequesting a letter of permission has the burden of establishing that the\napplicable standards of this section will be met. (c) In granting, denying or modifying a\npermit, a local government must apply the standards for permit issuance\ncontained in this section in conjunction with the classification of the subject\nwetland as indicated by the official map filed by the department. In applying\nthese standards, the local government must consider the effects of the proposed\nactivity regardless of political boundaries. In granting a letter of\npermission, a local government must determine that the proposed activity\ncomplies with the limits of the activities as stated in subdivision (g) of this\nsection. (d) As shown in the chart\nin subdivision (e) of this section, a determination of compatibility and a\nweighing of need against benefits lost are the criteria for decisionmaking. The\nthree tests for compatibility must be used for all activities listed in the\nminimum land-use regulations of subdivision (g) of this section that carry a\ncompatibility category of \"C\" or \"N\" as defined in subdivision (g) of this\nsection. Activities and land uses not listed in the minimum land-use\nregulations also must be evaluated using the three-part compatibility test. Activities designated as \"LP\" in subdivision (g) of this section have been\ndetermined under the minimum land-use regulations to be compatible and no\nfurther compatibility or weighing analysis need be performed before issuance of\na letter of permission as defined in section\n665.2\nof this Part. Activities\nidentified as \"E\" are exempt and do not require either a permit or letter of\npermission. Exempt activities are included in subdivision (g) of this section\nto assist local governments in determining regulatory procedures. (1)\n\nWhen the three tests of compatibility\ngiven in the chart in subdivision (e) of this section are met, no other\nweighing standards need apply, regardless of the wetland's classification, and\na permit, with or without conditions, may be issued for the proposed activity. In conjunction with the three-part test, the statewide minimum land-use\nregulations contained in subdivision (g) of this section or a local variance\nfrom them that has been duly adopted according to the provisions of section\n665.8\nof this Part are the basis\nfor determinations of compatibility. (2)\n\nIf the proposed activity cannot meet all\nthree tests of compatibility or if it is identified as \"X,\" incompatible, then, for a permit to be issued, the activity must meet each of the weighing\nstandards listed in the chart in subdivision (e) of this section for the\nclassification of the wetland that would be affected by the proposed\nactivity. (3)\n\nIf a local government\ndetermines that a written request for a letter of permission exceeds the\nthresholds identified in the items listed in subdivision (g) of this section, a\nletter of permission may not be issued. Instead, the proposed action must be\ntested for compatibility using the three-part test in subdivision (e) of this\nsection and a permit application must be processed pursuant to the act and this\n\nPart. If there is a question or doubt as to whether any proposed activity being\nreviewed for compatibility with the three-part test in subdivision (e) of this\nsection meets any of the three parts of the test, the action must be treated as\nincompatible and the activity weighed according to the standards identified in\nsubdivision (e) of this section. (e) Standards for permit\nissuance. (1)\n\nCompatibility. These\nthree tests are to be used to determine the compatibility of all activities\nidentified as \"C\" or \"N\" in subdivision (g) of this section for any action not\nlisted in subdivision (g). If all three of the following tests of compatibility\nare met, no other weighing standards need be met, regardless of the wetland\nclass. A permit, with or without conditions, may be issued for a proposed\nactivity on a wetland of any class or in a wetland's adjacent area if it is\ndetermined that the activity (i) would be compatible with preservation, protection and conservation of the wetland and its benefits, and (ii) would\nresult in no more than insubstantial degradation to, or loss or, any part of\nthe wetland, and (iii) would be compatible with the public health and\nwelfare. (2)\n\nWeighing. These\nweighing standards must be applied to all activities identified as \"X\" in\nsubdivision (g) of this section, and to all those activities listed as \"C\" or\n\"N\" in subdivision (g) or not listed in subdivision (g) which do not meet the\nthree tests of compatibility listed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. If\nthe proposed activity is listed as \"X\" or cannot meet the three tests for\ncompatibility, then a permit shall be issued only if the proposed activity\nmeets each of the standards below for the clases of wetland affected: Class I\nWetlands\n1,2,3\n\nClass II\nWetlands\n1,2,3\n\nClass III\nWetlands\n1,2,3\n\nClass IV\nWetlands\n1,2,4\n\nClass I wetlands provide the most critical of the\n\nState's wetland benefits, reduction of which is acceptable only in the most\nunusual circumstances. A permit shall be issued only if it is determined that\nthe proposed activity satisfies a compelling economic or social need that\nclearly and substantially outweighs the loss of or detriment to the benefit(s)\nof the Class I wetland. Class II wetlands provide important wetland\nbenefits, the loss of which is acceptable only in very limited circumstances. A\npermit shall be issued only if it is determined that the proposed activity\nsatisfies a pressing economic or social need that clearly outweighs the loss of\nor detriment to the benefit(s) of the Class II wetland. Class III wetlands supply wetland benefits, the\nloss of which is acceptable only after the exercise of discernment. A permit\nshall be issued only if it is determined that the proposed activity satisfies\nan economic or social need that outweighs the loss of or detriment to the\nbenefit(s) of the Class III wetland. Class IV wetlands provide some wildlife and open\nspace benefits and may provide other benefits cited in the act. Therefore, wanton or uncontrolled degradation or loss of Class IV wetlands is\nunacceptable. A permit shall be issued for a proposed activity in a Class IV\nwetland only if it is determined that the activity would be the only\npracticable alternative which could accomplish the applicant's objectives. 1 The proposed activity must be compatible with the\npublic health and welfare. 2 The proposed activity must be the only practicable\nalternative which could accomplish the applicant's objectives and must have no\npracticable alternative on a site that is not a freshwater wetland or adjacent\narea. 3 The proposed activity must minimize degradation to, or\nloss of, any part of the wetland or its adjacent area and must minimize any\nadverse impacts on the functions and benefits which that wetland\nprovides. 4 The proposed activity must make a reasonable effort to\nminimize degradation to, or loss of, any part of the wetland or its adjacent\narea. (f) Interpretation of some terms used in subdivision (e) of this\nsection. (1)\n\nPublic health and\nwelfare. These concerns include: (i) consistency of the proposed activity with physical health, if necessary as\njudged by health professionals; and\n(ii)\nconsistency with related Federal, State\nand local laws, regulations and policies. If a proposed activity is inconsistent with physical\nhealth, or with any related laws, regulations and government policies, this\nwould weigh against issuing a permit under the act until such conditions were\nmet that would make the proposed activity consistent with these\nprovisions. (2)\n\nOnly practicable alternative. A proposed activity is the only\npracticable alternative if no other is physically or economically feasible. This does not, however, mean that the most profitable or least costly\nalternative is the only feasible one nor that the least profitable or most\ncostly alternative is the only feasible one. (3)\n\nEconomic and social\nneed. When the economic and social need for the proposed activity is\nconsidered, the economic and social burden that would be imposed on the public\nshall be considered. The public economic and social burden may include: associated services, such as sewer systems, schools, and fire and police\nprotection, necessitated by the proposed activity; prevention of contamination, flood, or other damage to the proposed development on the wetland by methods\nsuch as channelization, alteration of land, alteration of water flow, draining, or construction of dams, dikes, or levees; and/or services and repairs, such as\nmedical care, pumping, cleaning, dredging, and emergency assistance as a result\nof contamination, flooding, or other damage to the proposed development on the\nwetland. Nothing in this section precludes the consideration of any issue which\nmust be addressed under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (article 8\nof the Environmental Conservation Law). (4)\n\nSpecific Class I\nstandards. (i) \"... reduction of\nwhich is acceptable only in unusual circumstances.\" Permits for the vast\nmajority of activities that could not avoid reducing a benefit provided by a\n\nClass I wetland would not be approved. The word\nreduction\nmeans that this applies not just to the loss of any benefit, but to the partial\nloss or reduction of a benefit. (ii)\n\"... satisfied a compelling economic\nor social need...\" The word\ncompelling\nimplies that the\nproposed activity carries with it not merely a sense of desirability or\nurgency, but of actual necessity; that the proposed activity must be done; that\nis it unavoidable. (iii)\n\"... clearly and substantially outweighs...\"\nClearly\nmeans that\nthe need for the proposed activity must outweigh the loss of or detriment to\nthe benefits in a way that is beyond serious debate. Substantially\ncarries this further, in that not only must the\nneed clearly outweigh the loss or detriment, but the margin of outweighing\nitself must be large or significant. (5)\n\nSpecific Class II\nstandards. (i) \"...loss of which is\nacceptable only in limited circumstances.\" Permits for most activities that\ncould not avoid causing a loss of or detriment to a benefit provided by a Class\nII wetland would not be approved. (ii)\n\"... satisfies a pressing economic or\nsocial need...\"\nPressing\nshould suggest that for the need to\noutweigh the loss of or detriment to a benefit of a Class II wetland, it must\nbe urgent and intense, though it does not have to be necessary or\nunavoidable. (iii)\n\"... clearly outweighs...\"\nmeans that the need for the proposed\nactivity must outweigh the loss of or detriment to the benefits in a way that\nis beyond serious debate, although there does not have to be a large or\nsignificant margin between the need and the loss. (6)\n\nSpecific Class III\nstandards. (i) \"... loss of which\nis acceptable only after the exercise of caution and discernment.\" This means\nthat permits could be issued for activities that could not avoid loss of or\ndetriment to a benefit provided by a Class III wetland, but only after careful\nevaluation. (ii)\n\"... satisfied\nan economic or social need...\" The need for the activity is real and\nundeniable, though it does not have to be necessary, unavoidable, urgent or\nintense. (iii)\n\"... outweighs...\"\nmeans that the need for the activity must\noutweigh the loss of or detriment to a benefit, but the balance in favor of the\nactivity does not have to be beyond serious debate. (7)\n\nClass IV standards. Permit issuance cannot be indiscriminate or unexamined\nfor Class IV wetlands and still require consideration of loss of wetland\nvalues. (g) The\ncommissioner is charged pursuant to section 24-0903 of the act with the\nidentification of compatible uses of each class of wetlands in the form of\nminimum land-use regulations. The chart included in this subdivision serves as\nstatewide minimum land-use regulations for use by local governments or the\ndepartment as appropriate, subject to local variance in accordance with section\n665.8\nof this Part. These land-use\nregulations, in conjunction with the standards for permit issuance, are the\nbasis for determinations of compatibility. The following categories are used in\nthe statewide minimum land-use regulations: (1)\n\"LP\" means that a letter of permission\nwill be issued for the proposed activity. These are activities which are\nneither specifically exempted from the regulation nor identified for regulation\naccording to section 24-0701 of the act, but which the commissioner has\ndetermined will not have a significant adverse impact on freshwater\nwetlands. (2)\n\"C\" means that a\nregulated activity may be compatible with a wetland and its functions and\nbenefits, although in some circumstances the proposed action may be\nincompatible. (3)\n\"N\" means that a\nregulated activity is usually incompatible with a wetland and its functions or\nbenefits, although in some cases the proposed action may be insignificant\nenough to be compatible. (4)\n\"X\"\nmeans that a regulated activity is incompatible with a wetland and its\nfunctions and benefits. (5)\n\"E\"\nmeans that an activity is exempted in section 24-0701 of the act, or is not\nregulated by the act because the activity will not substantially impair any of\nthe functions or benefits of freshwater wetlands. Exempt actions are not\nregulated, but are included in the tables in subdivision (g) of this section to\nassist permit application reviewers in determining regulatory requirements. (g) Statewide\nminimum land-use regulations-determinations of compatibility. The statewide minimum land-use regulations establish the\ncompatibility categories to be used in conjunction with the different types of\nland-use activities to be conducted upon freshwater wetlands or adjacent areas. For activities and land uses not shown on this chart, a local government or the\ndepartment, as appropriate, must first make a determination that the activity\nis a regulated activity as defined in the act and section\n665.2\nof this Part. If the activity\nis regulated, then an independent determination of compatibility using the\nthree tests for compatibility contained in the standards for permit issuance in\nsubdivision (e) of this section must be used. Area categories\n\nCompatibility\ncategories\nFWW - Freshwater Wetland\nLP - Compatible; letter of permission issued\nAA - Adjacent Area\nC - Usually compatible\nN - Usually incompatible\nX - Incompatible\nE - Exempt\n\nExempt Activities\n\nThe following activities either have been exempted\nfrom regulation by the act or are not regulated because they will not\nsubstantially impair any of the functions and benefits of freshwater\nwetlands. Compatibility by Area\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n1. Continuing lawfully existing uses and continuing\nall activities normally and directly associated with any such use, except for\nthose activities covered by items 38, 39, 40 and 41, where such continuance\ndoes not involve expansion or significant alteration of the existing use and\ndoes not affect additional wetland area. E\nE\n2. Establishing scenic, historic, wildlife, and\nscientific preserves, where no significant impairment of the wetland or its\nbenefits is involved. E\nE\n3. Boating, hiking, swimming, camping, picnicking and\nother similar nonmotorized forms of outdoor activity, where no significant\nimpairment of the wetland or its benefits is involved. E\nE\n4. Depositing or removing the natural products of\nwetlands in the process of recreational or commercial fishing, shellfishing, aquiculture, hunting or trapping, including the erection and maintenance of\ntemporary hides or blinds. E\nE\n5. Conducting educational and scientific research\nactivities where no significant impairment of the wetland or its benefits is\ninvolved. E\nE\n6. Establishing walking trails, where no significant\nimpairment of the wetland or its benefits is involved. E\nE\n7. Establishing an individual recreational\nmooring. E\nE\n8. Gathering fuelwood, except as covered by items 22, 23 and 24. E\nE\n9. Conducting an agricultural activity as defined in\nthe act or section\n665.2\nof this Part. E\nE\nExisting Structures and\n\nFacilities\n\nNormally, maintenance, repair or restoration of\nexisting facilities will not cause adverse impacts on wetlands. This is not\nalways true, however, for construction activities that are associated with such\nmaintenance, repair or restoration, such as the placing of access roads, staging areas and utilities. Various such associated activities are listed\nelsewhere in this chart. Expansion or substantial restoration or\nreconstruction of existing structures and facilities can have significant\nimpacts on the functions and benefits of wetlands. These impacts can be greater\nthan those caused by the total replacement of the structures or facilities or\nby their construction in a different location. Compatibility by Area\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n10. Ordinary maintenance and repair of existing\nfunctional structures, facilities or improved areas, including but not limited\nto bridges, roads, highways, culverts, railroad beds, bulkheads, docks, beaches, piers, wharves, pilings, dolphins, utility rights-of-way, buildings, landscaped or paved areas, lawns, and mosquito control ditches. Such\nmaintenance and repair might include, for example, replacing broken boards in\ndocks, repainting structures, redriving pilings, resurfacing paved areas, and\ninstalling and removing docks on a seasonal basis, but does not include\nactivities covered by items 22, 23, 24, 38, 39, 40 and 41 or other applicable\nitems listed in this chart. E\nE\n11. In-kind and in-place replacement of existing\nfunctional bulkheads and similar structures. LP\nLP\n12. Routine beach regrading and cleaning. LP\nLP\n13. Restoring, reconstructing or modifying existing\nfunctional structures or facilities which involves a temporary disturbance of\nless than 50 square meters (approximately 540 square feet) of ground\nsurface. C\nLP*\n14. Expanding or substantially modifying existing\nfunctional structures or facilities, except for activities covered by items 13, 19 or 31. N\nC\nOperating Motor Vehicles\n\nIntense use of motor vehicles may impair any of the\nseveral functions and benefits of wetlands by introducing or increasing\ncontaminants, noise or other forms of pollution, or by removing or reducing\nvegetation and exposing soil to erosion. Occasional use generally does not\nwarrant regulation. Compatibility by Area\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n15. Operating all-terrain vehicles, air and motor\nboats, and snowmobiles, except as described in item 16. E\nE\n16. Intensive, organized and repetitive use of\nall-terrain vehicles, air and motor boats and snowmobiles. N\nC\nDraining, Filling, Grading, Clear-cutting\nand Dredging\n\nGenerally, draining of wetlands lowers groundwater\nlevels, may increase downstream peak flows, and may decrease water storage\ncapacity and downstream base flow. It may also cause changes in vegetation and\nwater temperature, increased stream bed scouring, and sediment deposition. Draining can totally destroy a wetland. Filling decreases the number and size of wetlands, thereby decreasing their ability to collect runoff and prevent erosion and\nsediment deposition downstream. Certain fill materials may adversely affect\nwater quality. Disposal of dredge material may result in erosion and cause\nturbidity and sediment deposition. Filling eliminates wetland habitat for fish\nand wildlife, may alter the water table and groundwater flow and adversely\naffect groundwater recharge, and can irreversibly destroy a wetland. Grading a wetland or adjacent area can\nsubstantially alter surface water drainage and flow patterns, may temporarily\nincrease erosion, and may eliminate fish and wildlife habitat. Clear-cutting removes the vegetative cover of\nwetlands and may reduce their ability to absorb water and serve as habitat. It\nmay also cause soil erosion. Dredging or excavation may increase water depth and\nremove wetland vegetation, thus altering the basic characteristics of, and\nperhaps destroying, wetlands. Fish and wildlife feeding or reproductive\ncapacities may be altered, as may covertypes, turbidity, sediment deposition\nand erosion patterns. Any of these activities can cause the permanent\nloss of benefits provided by wetlands, and may, in fact, destroy wetlands\nentirely. Compatibility by Area\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n17. Draining and altering water levels, except as part\nof an agricultural activity. X\nX\n18. Removing or breaching beaver dams. N\nC\n19. Constructing, expanding or substantially modifying\ndrainage ditches, except as part of an agricultural activity. X\nN\n20. Filling, including filling for agricultural\npurposes. X\nN\n21. Installing or creating a dry well, retention basin, filter, open swale or pond. N\nN\n22. Clear-cutting trees. N\nC\n23. Clear-cutting vegetation other than trees except as\npart of an agricultural activity. X\nN\n24. Cutting but not elimination or destruction of\nvegetation, such that the functions and benefits of the wetland are not\nsignificantly adversely affected. LP\nLP\n25. Grading, and dredging not included in item 26. X\nN\n26. Dredging less than 400 cubic meters (approximately\n523 cubic yards) to maintain present navigation channels. C\nC\n27. Mining. X\nX\n28. Constructing roads, except for winter truck roads\nas defined in section\n665.2\n(c)(1)(vi)\nof\nthis Part. X\nN\n29. Drilling a water well to serve an individual\nresidence. C\nLP\n30. Drilling a well, except for activities covered by\nitem 29. X\nN\nDams, Docks and Bulkheads\n\nGenerally, structures of this type are indicative\nof associated development which may increase disruptive human use or occupancy\nof wetland areas. A structure sometimes interferes with surface or\nsubsurface water flow, increases water levels, or otherwise affects wetland\nwater supply. The impact of such a structure is related to its size, location\nand design. For example, docks on piles are generally more compatible with the\nfunctions and benefits of wetlands than are docks on fill. Dams alter normal flow patterns and often increase\nwater levels, thus eliminating or altering the natural vegetation. Depending on\nthe size of the structure, entire wetlands can be destroyed. Compatibility by Area\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n31. Installing a dock, pier, wharf or other structure\nbuilt on floats or open-work supports and having a top surface area of 20\nsquare meters (approximately 200 square feet) or less. C\nC\n32. Installing any dock, pier, wharf or other structure\nused as a landing place on water, except for activities covered by item\n31. N\nN\n33. Constructing groins, bulkheads and other shoreline\nstabilization structures. X\nN\n34. Constructing or removing berms, levees, dikes, dams, and other control structures. X\nN\nUtilities\n\nInstalling utilities in or adjacent to wetlands\nwill be presumed to cause less damage to those wetlands if little or no\nadditional clearing and grading is necessary. Where extensive clearing and\nconstruction of access or maintenance roads occurs, erosion and sedimentation\nmay be the most serious problems. Installing overhead lines, while often spanning\nwetlands and thereby minimizing construction impacts, will result in a\npermanent adverse aesthetic impact on wetlands. Overhead power lines may also\nresult in higher bird mortality rates, either through collision or\nelectrocution. Compatibility by Area\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n35. Installing utility service to an individual\nresidence. LP\nE\n36. Installing electric, telephone or other utilities\nfrom an existing utility distribution facility to a structure, except for\nactivities covered by item 35, where no major modifications or construction\nactivities in the wetland are necessary. C\nLP\n37. Installing utilities, except for activities\nregulated by article VII or VIII of the Public Service Law or by item 36. X\nN\nPollution and Pesticides\n\nIntroduction of sewage effluent, runoff of\npesticides, or disposal of toxic substances into wetlands or adjacent areas may\ncontaminate ground and surface water with undesirable chemicals, nutrients and\norganisms. The contamination may be temporary or permanent. It may result from\nactivities located directly in wetlands or within adjacent areas, but, due to\nrunoff and drainage patterns, it may also be caused by activities located some\ndistance away. Distant activities can have adverse effects as severe as those\ncaused by activities within or adjacent to wetlands. The presence of pollutants\nor pesticides in wetlands or adjacent areas may increase mortality rates among\nfish and wildlife, alter their behavior or reproductive capability, and\nadversely affect their value as a food source. Excessive nutrients alter\nvegetative cover, fish and wildlife distribution and water potability. Resulting organisms may also create a health hazard. Compatibility by Area\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n38. Introducing or storing any substance, including any\nchemical, petrochemical, solid waste, nuclear waste, toxic material, sewage\neffluent or other pollutant, except as described in items 39, 40 and 41. X\nX\n39. Application of a pesticide conducted pursuant to a\npermit issued under article 15 of the Environmental Conservation Law (see 6\nNYCRR Parts\n327, 328\nand\n329\n). N\nC\n40. Application of a pesticide where no permit is\nrequired under article 15 of the Environmental Conservation Law (see 6 NYCRR\nParts\n327, 328\nand\n329\n). X\nX\n41. Application of a pesticide to the grounds of a\nprivate residence when such use is by the owner. C\nLP\nBuildings\n\nConstructing buildings, accessory roads and parking\nareas can have several effect on wetlands, not the least of which is the\nincreased pressure to continue development beyond the initial\nconstruction. Roofs and paved areas quickly shed rain where that\nrain previously had an opportunity to soak into the ground. This can result in\nmore turbulent streamflow, more erosion and sedimentation, and higher water\nlevels in surrounding areas, including in nearby wetlands. The effects of filling, grading and draining are\ndiscussed elsewhere in this chart. Compatibility by Area\n\nItems\n\nActivities\nFWW\nAA\n42. Constructing a residence or related structures or\nfacilities. X\nN\n43. Constructing commercial or industrial facilities, public buildings or related structures or facilities. X\nX\n(h) The applicant may suggest a proposal to\nenhance the existing benefits provided by a wetland or to create and maintain\nnew wetland benefits in order to increase the likelihood that a proposed\nactivity will meet the applicable standards for permit issuance. Such a\nproposal must meet the following provisions: (1)\nthe mitigation must occur on or in the\nimmediate vicinity of the site of the proposed project; (2)\nthe area affected by the proposed\nmitigation must be regulated by this Part after mitigative measures are\ncompleted; and\n(3)\nthe mitigation\nmust provide substantially the same or more benefits that will be lost through\nthe proposed activity. (i) Duly filed notice in writing that the\n\nState or any agency or political subdivision of the State is in the process of\nacquiring any freshwater wetland by negotiation or condemnation authorizes but\ndoes not require denial of any permit, but only if both the affected landowner\nand the local government have been so notified. (1)\n\nThe written notice must include an\nindication that the acquisition process has commenced, such as that an\nappraisal of the property has been prepared or is in the process of being\nprepared. (2)\n\nIf the landowner\nreceives no offer for the property within one year of the permit denial, this\nbar to the permit lapses. If its negotiations with the applicant are broken\noff, the State or any agency or political subdivision must, within six months\nof the end of negotiation, either issue its findings and determination to\nacquire the property pursuant to section\n204\nof the Eminent Domain Procedure Law or\nissue a determination to acquire the property without public hearing pursuant\nto section 206 of the General Domain Procedure Law, or this ban to the permit\nlapses. Footnotes\n\nFootnotes\n1 The proposed activity must be compatible with the\npublic health and welfare. 2 The proposed activity must be the only practicable\nalternative which could accomplish the applicant's objectives and must have no\npracticable alternative on a site that is not a freshwater wetland or adjacent\narea. 3 The proposed activity must minimize degradation to, or\nloss of, any part of the wetland or its adjacent area and must minimize any\nadverse impacts on the functions and benefits which that wetland\nprovides. 4 The proposed activity must make a reasonable effort to\nminimize degradation to, or loss of, any part of the wetland or its adjacent\narea. * For classic kettlehole bogs as defined in section\n665.2\n(g) of this\n\nPart, the category is \"C\".
