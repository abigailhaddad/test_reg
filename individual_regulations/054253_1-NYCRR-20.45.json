(ii)\n\nShould the proration pursuant to\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph result in the total pounds of skim milk at\nall pool plants of the handler that are to be subtracted at this allocation\nstep from Class II and Class III combined exceeding the pounds of skim milk\nremaining in Class II and Class III at all such plants, the pounds of such\nexcess shall be subtracted from the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I-A\nmilk and Class I-B milk after such proration at the pool plants at which such\nother source milk was received. (iii)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph, should the computations pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii)\nof this paragraph result in a quantity of skim milk to be subtracted from Class\nII and Class III combined that exceeds the pounds of skim milk remaining in\nsuch classes, the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined shall\nbe increased (increasing as necessary Class III and then Class II to the extent\nof available utilization in such classes at the nearest other pool plant of the\nhandler, and then at each successively more distant pool plant of the handler)\nby an amount equal to such excess quantity to be subtracted, and the pounds of\nskim milk in Class I-A milk and Class I-B milk combined shall be decreased by a\nlike amount, pro rata to remaining utilization in each such class. In such\ncase, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step\nat the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in the reverse direction\nby a like amount. (iv)\n\nExcept as\nprovided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, should the computations\npursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph result in a quantity of\nskim milk to be subtracted from Class I-A milk or Class I-B milk that exceeds\nthe pounds of skim milk remaining in that class, the pounds of skim milk in\nsuch class shall be increased by an amount equal to such excess quantity to be\nsubtracted, and the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III combined\nshall be decreased by a like amount (decreasing as necessary Class III and then\n\nClass II). In such case, the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at\nthis allocation step at the handler's other pool plants shall be adjusted in\nthe reverse direction by a like amount in sequence beginning with the nearest\nother pool plant of such handler at which Class I-A or Class I-B utilization is\navailable. (16)\n\nIf the\nplant at which assignment is being made is a plant from which 50 percent or\nmore of the gross receipts of skim milk and butterfat in the form of fluid milk\nproducts left the plant in the form of fluid milk products in consumer packages\nor dispenser inserts and was classified as Class I-A, subtract pro rata from\nthe remaining pounds of skim milk in each class the pounds of skim milk in\nreceipts of fluid milk product from plants in the 401 miles and over freight\nzone, not defined pursuant to section\n20.8\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Part. (17)\n\nSubtract from the\nremaining pounds of skim milk in Class I-A milk the pounds of skim milk in\nremaining receipts from plants (except other order plants) of units the pool\nstatus of which has not been established and which receipts have not previously\nbeen assigned pursuant to paragraphs (13) and (16) of this\nsubdivision.

(ii)\n\nIf the transferor plant received during\nthe month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to paragraph (7) of this\nsubdivision the skim milk so transferred shall be classified so as to allocate\nthe least possible Class I-A or I-B utilization to such other source\nmilk. (iii)\n\nIf the transferor\nhandler received during the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to\nparagraph (13) of this subdivision, the skim milk so transferred shall not be\nclassified as Class I-A or I-B to a greater extent than would be applicable to\na like quantity of such other source milk received at the transferee\nplant. (19)\n\nAdd to the\nremaining pounds of skim milk in Class I-A the pounds of skim milk received\ndirectly from dairy farmers or units which was deducted pursuant to the proviso\nin the preamble of this section. (20)\n\nIf the pounds of skim milk remaining in\nall classes exceeds the pounds of skim milk in receipts from producers subtract\nsuch excess from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series\nbeginning with Class III. Any amount so subtracted shall be know as\noverage. (b) Butterfat\nshall be allocated in accordance with the procedure outlined from skim milk in\nsubdivision (a) of this section. (c) Combine the amounts of skim milk and\nbutterfat determined pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section into\none total for each class. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
