Tit. 6 §§ 495-1.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the\npurposes of this Part, the following definitions apply: (1)\n'Active gas-insulated equipment or active\nGIE.' GIE that is non-hermetically sealed and is connected through busbars or\ncables to an electrical power system; or that is fully charged, ready for\nservice and being prepared for connection to an electrical power system. This\ndoes not include spare GIE. (2)\n'Acquire.' To take possession and/or ownership of an item or to obtain an item\nthrough lease. Equipment under temporary ownership or possession by the\nmanufacturer during transport and equipment transported through New York that\nwill never be used in New York are not considered \"acquired.\"\n(3)\n'Authorized representative.' A natural\nperson authorized to represent a business entity or other\norganization. (4)\n'Carbon dioxide\nequivalent or CO2e.' The amount of carbon dioxide by mass that would produce\nthe same global warming impact as the given mass of another greenhouse gas over\na specific time frame. For the purposes of this Part, CO2e is calculated using\nGWP20. (5)\n'Circuit breaker.' A\ndevice designed to automatically interrupt high currents in order to protect\nelectrical equipment from damage. (6)\n'Covered gas container.' A container\ncontaining or designed to contain covered insulating gas. (7)\n'Covered insulating gas.' An insulating\ngas with a GWP20 greater than one. A substance is considered a covered\ninsulating gas if the GWP20 is unknown, but the substance may be reasonably\nanticipated to have a GWP greater than one over an integrated twenty-year time\nframe. (8)\n'Covered insulating gas\nat activation.' A value representing a baseline amount of covered insulating\ngas as recorded in the GIE inventory following procedures specified in section\n495-1.6 of this Part and including a consideration of equity share, where the\nGIE is jointly owned. (9)\n'Data\nyear.' Calendar year in which a GIE owner maintains a GIE inventory pursuant to\nsection 495-1.6 of this Part. (10)\n'Day.' One calendar day. (11)\n'Electrical power system.' The combination of electrical generators (i.e., power plants), transmission and distribution lines, equipment, circuits, and\ntransformers used to generate and transport electricity from the generator to\nconsumption areas or to adjacent electrical power systems. (12)\n'Emergency event.' A situation arising\nfrom a sudden and unforeseen event including, but not limited to, a severe\nstorm, fire, flood, or act of vandalism. (13)\n'Failure.' The sudden and unexpected, or\nimminent, failure of a GIE device that requires replacement of the\ndevice. (14)\n'First reporting\nyear.' The earliest calendar year in which a GIE owner is subject to this\n\nPart. (15)\n'Gas cart.' Any device\ndesigned to transfer insulating gas into or out of GIE, with the gas coming\nfrom or going into a permanent or removable gas container or the gas cart\nitself. A gas cart may utilize gas containers, but gas containers do not fall\nwithin the definition of gas cart. (16)\n'Gas container.' A single vessel\ncontaining or designed to contain a gas used as an insulating gas in GIE. This\nincludes pressurized cylinders, any container that can be removed from gas\ncarts, or other containers, but does not include GIE or the gas cart\nitself. (17)\n'Gas-insulated\nequipment or GIE or GIE device.' Interchangeable terms that refer to any\nelectrical power equipment, regardless of location and insulating medium (e.g., solid dielectric, vacuum, SF\n6, alternative gas), that\nprovide insulating and/or interrupting (arc quenching) functions related to\noperation of electrical power systems. GIE includes, but is not limited to, switchgear, switches, circuit switchers, coupling capacitor potential devices, gas-insulated substations, and circuit breakers. This definition includes\nhermetically sealed GIE and non-hermetically sealed GIE. (18)\n'GIE characteristics.' For GIE whose\nvoltage capacity is 38 kV or less, this means the combination of attributes\nlisted in section 495-1.4(b) of this Part or configuration, voltage capacity\n(kV), and short-circuit current rating (kA). For GIE whose voltage capacity is\ngreater than 38 kV, this means the combination of attributes listed in section\n495-1.4(c) of this Part or voltage capacity (kV) and short-circuit current\nrating (kA). (19)\n'GIE owner.' The\nentity who owns GIE that uses covered insulating gas. This does not include\ntemporary ownership or possession by the manufacturer such as during transport\nfor purposes of repair or installation. A GIE owner may be a limited liability\ncompany, subsidiary, parent company, or other entity that is an owner of the\nGIE that uses covered insulating gas. (20)\n'GWP20.' An assessment of the Global\n\nWarming Potential of greenhouse gases over an integrated twenty-year time frame\nas published in the IPCC Assessment Report. (21)\n'Hermetically sealed GIE.' GIE that are\npre-charged with covered insulating gas, sealed at the factory, and designed by\nthe manufacturer to not be fillable by the GIE owner or a third-party\ndesignee. (22)\n'Insulating gas.'\nThe gas used in GIE to provide dielectric insulation and/or to interrupt\nelectrical currents. (23)\n'IPCC\nAssessment Report.' Table 7.SM.7 in Smith, C., Z.R.J. Nicholls, K. Armour, W. Collins, P. Forster, M. Meinshausen, M.D. Palmer, and M. Watanabe, 2021: The\n\nEarth's Energy Budget, Climate Feedbacks, and Climate Sensitivity Supplementary\n\nMaterial.

The design capacity of the insulating gas specified by the\nmanufacturer for optimal performance of a GIE device. Nameplate capacity may be\nfound on the nameplate attached to the GIE device, may be stated within the\nmanufacturer's official product specifications, or may be the value calculated\nby the GIE owner following the procedure specified in Federal Register, Vol. 89, No. 81, pages 31934-31936 (Apr. 25, 2024) (amendment to\n40 CFR\nPart\n§98.303(b)), incorporated by reference herein, per section 495-1.15 of\nthis Part. (25)\n'Non-hermetically\nsealed GIE.' GIE that contain a covered insulating gas and are designed by the\nmanufacturer to be fillable by the GIE owner or a third-party\ndesignee.

(32)\n'Substitute.' Any chemical, substance, product substitute, or alternative manufacturing process, whether existing or\nnew, that may be used or is intended for use as a replacement. (33)\n'Tare weight.' The weight of an empty\ngas container that when subtracted from the gross weight yields the amount of\ngas in the gas container. (34)\n'Voltage capacity.'
