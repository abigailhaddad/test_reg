  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 225-1.2 - Sulfur-in-fuel limitations\n\nState Regulations\n\nNo person will sell, offer for sale, purchase, or fire\nany fuel and/or waste oil that exceeds the sulfur-in-fuel limitations of this\n\nSection, except as provided in Sections 225-1.3 or\n225-1.4\nof this Subpart. For the\npurposes of this Subpart, liquid bio-fuels, other than waste oils, are required\nto meet the sulfur-in-fuel standards of distillate oil. (a) Owners and/or operators of any stationary\ncombustion installation that fires coal and has a total heat input greater than\n250 million Btu per hour, where an application for a permit was received by the\ndepartment after March 15, 1973, and the stationary combustion installation is\nnot located in New York City or Nassau, Rockland or Westchester Counties, are\nlimited to the firing of coal with 0.60 pound of sulfur per million Btu gross\nheat content or less. If two or more emission sources are connected to a common\nair cleaning device and/or emission point, the total heat input for such\nemission point is the sum of the total heat input of all emission sources that\nare operated simultaneously and connected to the common air cleaning device\nand/or emission point; or\n(b) Owners\nand/or operators of any stationary combustion installation that fires solid\nfuels are limited to the firing of solid fuel with a sulfur content listed in\nthe table below. On and after July 1, 2023, all emission sources, including\nprocess and incineration sources that fire solid fuels, are limited to the\nfiring of solid fuel with a sulfur content listed in the table below: Area\n\nSolid fuel (pounds of sulfur per million Btu\ngross heat content)\n\nNew York City, Nassau, Rockland and Westchester\n\nCounties\n0.2 MAX\nSuffolk County: Towns of Babylon, Brookhaven, Huntington, Islip, and Smith Town\n0.6 MAX\nErie and Niagara Counties\n1.7 MAX, 1.4 AVG*\nRemainder of State\n2.5 MAX, 1.9 AVG*, and 1.7 AVG\n(ANNUAL)**\n* Averages are computed for each emission source by\ndividing the total sulfur content by the total gross heat content of all solid\nfuel received during any consecutive three-month period. ** Annual averages are computed for each emission source\nby dividing the total sulfur content by the total gross heat content of all\nsolid fuel received during any consecutive 12-month period. (c) Owners and/or operators of any stationary\ncombustion installation that fires residual oil are limited to the firing of\nresidual oil with a sulfur content listed in the table below. On and after July\n1, 2023, all emission sources, including process and incineration sources that\nfire residual oil, are limited to the firing of residual oil with a sulfur\ncontent listed in the table below: Area\n\nResidual Oil (percent sulfur by weight)\n\nNew York City\n0.30\n\nNassau, Rockland and Westchester\n\nCounties\n0.37\n\nRemainder of State\n0.50\n(d) Owners and/or operators of any stationary\ncombustion installation that fires distillate oil are limited to the firing of\ndistillate oil with 0.0015 percent sulfur by weight or less. On and after July\n1, 2023, all emission sources, including process and incineration sources that\nfire distillate oil, are limited to the firing of distillate oil with 0.0015\npercent sulfur by weight or less. (e) Owners and/or operators of any emission\nsource that fires waste oil are limited to the firing of waste oil with 0.75\npercent sulfur by weight or less. On and after July 1, 2023, owners and/or\noperators of any emission source that fires waste oil are limited to the firing\nof waste oil with 0.25 percent sulfur by weight or less. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
