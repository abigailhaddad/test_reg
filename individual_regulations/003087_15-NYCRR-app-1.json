A Vehicle Use Tax on every passenger or suburban\nvehicle registered to residents of New York City, or to nonresidents of New\n\nYork City who have maintained an abode in New York City for at least 184 days\nin the year preceding the application for registration for a vehicle, or to\npersons, firms, copartnerships, trustees who conduct a business or association\nor a corporation, who regularly keep, store, garage or maintain the vehicle in\n\nNew York City will be collected by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles or his\nagents, and such tax must be paid, unless the registrant submits an exemption\ncertificate, stipulating the reason for the exemption. 2. Administrative Considerations. To implement the collection\nof this tax, the following administrative procedures will be followed: a. The tax will not apply to registrations which are exempt\nfrom registration fees. Included in this category are registrations issued to\nmunicipalities, foreign consulates and delegates, public authorities, and\ncertain disabled veterans. Also, the tax will not apply to certain nonprofit\ncharitable organizations or to residents of New York City who have not resided\nin the city for at least 30 days in the last year prior to application for\nregistration. b. In accordance with section\n1201 (h)\nof the Tax Law, the tax will be imposed only on original and renewal registrations. c. The tax will be assessed only on passenger and suburban\nvehicles. All other classes are excluded. d. The Department will determine its costs in administering the\nprogram. These costs will be deducted before distribution to the Commissioner\nof Finance. e. Revenues will be distributed to the Commissioner of Finance\nin accordance with procedures established by the New York State Department of\n\nAudit and Control. f. Exemption certificates other than those involving a change\nof address, will be forwarded by the issuing offices to Albany for data entry\nand subsequent mailing to the Commissioner of Finance. Also, the Department\nwill furnish to New York City the names of registrants against whom a tax was\nnot collected because of a change of address from within the City of New York\nto without the City of New York made at the time of renewal. This listing will\ninclude the old address and the new address. g. Exemptions disapproved will be returned by the Commissioner\nof Finance to Albany for further entry to indicate disapproval. 3. Procedures. a. Original Applications. An information insert (attachment 1) and an exemption\ncertificate (attachment 2) will be made available to all applicants for\noriginal registrations. The tax will be based on the county of legal residence (i.e., if the application for registration shows a legal address in New York City, the\n$15 tax will be added to the total annual fee. If the applicant shows a mailing\naddress in New York City and a legal address outside New York City, the $15 tax\nwill not be added to the total annual fee). In order for an exemption from the collection of the tax to be\ngranted, an exemption certificate will be required to be submitted for those\ntransactions for which the tax would ordinarily be due. b. Renewal Applications. (VIN).............................................................................................. (2) An information insert (attachment 1) explaining the tax\nwill be included with all renewals which contain the $15 tax. This insert will\nadvise the registrant that an exemption certificate (attachment 2) may be\nobtained at any Motor Vehicle Issuing Office. (3) Registrants against whom the tax is assessed and who\nindicate that it does not apply to them will be required to complete a tax\nexemption certificate. Part 1 of the registration, the word \"Exempt\" will be\nstamped directly through the \"Pay This Amount\" figure. (VIN).............................................................................................. (5) If the registrant shows the legal residence address in New\n\nYork City, with a mailing address elsewhere, or he indicates that he is\nrequired to pay the tax but the amount was not preprinted, the tax will be\ncharged. (6) Any transaction when the proper fee is not presented, or\nwhen the applicant indicates that the tax does not apply to him but refuses to\nsign an exemption certificate, will be rejected. c. Depositing and Reporting Operations. The revenue collected in connection with the Motor Vehicle Use\n\nTax will be deposited with other fees collected for registration transactions. A separate Advice of Deposit for the tax revenues will not be made. On the reverse side of the Advice of Deposit, the amount of the\n\nUse Tax money that is included in the total deposit will be entered in this\nmanner: \"Includes $________ N.Y.C. Use Tax\". This same format will be followed\non the reverse of the Advice of Deposit for Replacement Remittance when\nreplacement remittance is received for a protested check. d. Data Preparation and Control. Registration renewal applications which show fee amounts\nchanged will be scanned as long as they are acceptable in other aspects. Registration renewal applications showing a change of County\n\nCode will be forwarded to the Data Entry and Control Section for entry of the\nactual residence county. Tax exemption certificates will be entered upon receipt from\nissuing offices. Disapproval of tax exemptions will be entered upon receipt from\nthe Commissioner of Finance. e. Motor Vehicle Accounts Bureau. Daily and monthly accounting will provide separate totals for\nrevenues allocated to the New York City Use Tax. Each issuing office's terminal produced daily cash report will\nprovide a separate entry for collection of the tax. The use tax revenue collected will be recorded in a separate\nledger daily. When the quarterly report is completed, three copies of the\n\nVehicle Use Tax Distributor Certification (Form MV-2101) will be prepared. Adjustments for bad checks will be made and entered on this form. Two copies\nwill be forwarded to the Department of Audit and Control, and one copy will be\nretained by the Department of Motor Vehicles. The total amount of the Vehicle Use Tax is refundable if all or\nany part of the registration fee is refunded. 4. Attachment. a. Exemption Certificate. Front. Image\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp.
