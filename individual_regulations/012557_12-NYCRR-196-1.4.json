Tit. 12 §§ 196-1.4 - Employee Counts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purposes of Section 196-b, the number of employees employed by an\nemployer during a calendar year shall be determined by counting the highest\ntotal number of employees concurrently employed at any point during the\ncalendar year to date. (1)\n\nFor employers that\nincrease the number of employees during a calendar year above any threshold\ncontained in Section 196-b(1): (i) The\naccrual of additional required leave up to the entitlement amount in Section\n196-b(1) shall be prospective from the date of such increase and shall not\nentitle employees to reimbursement for previously used unpaid leave or to use\nmore than the maximum amount of leave set by the employer in accordance with\n\nSection 196-b(6). (ii)\n\nPrior\naccruals of used and unused paid leave and used unpaid leave in a calendar year\nmay be credited by an employer toward any increased paid leave obligations\nunder Section 196-b. Employers may not credit any prior accrual of unused\nunpaid leave toward any paid leave obligations. (iii)\n\nEmployees shall retain all existing\naccruals of paid and unpaid leave notwithstanding an increase in the number of\nemployees during a calendar year. (2)\n\nReductions in the number of employees\nworking for an employer shall not reduce employee leave entitlements under\n\nSection 196-b until the following calendar year. (b) Employees on paid or unpaid leave, including sick leave, leaves of absence, disciplinary suspension, or any other\ntype of temporary absence, are counted as long as the employer has a reasonable\nexpectation that the employee will later return to active employment. If there\nis no employment relationship (as when an employee is laid off or terminated, whether temporarily or permanently), such individual is not counted. (c) Part-time employees are considered to be\nemployed each working day of the calendar week. (d) Employees jointly employed by more than\none employer must be counted by each employer, whether or not they are on the\nemployer's payroll records, for the purposes of determining each employer's\nleave obligation under Section 196-b.
