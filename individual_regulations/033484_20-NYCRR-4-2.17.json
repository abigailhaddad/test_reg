  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.17 - Receipts from the sale of advertising\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(8))\n(a) Receipts from the sale of advertising\nencompass the following activities: (1)\n\nReceipts from providing advertising space or time in or on a medium for\ndissemination to the public or part of the public, whether such medium is for\nsale or for free consumption. Examples include: (i) the sale of printed page space in a\nmagazine, newspaper, or other similar periodical; (ii)\nthe sale of space on or in directories, bulletins, phone books, restaurant placemats, cash register receipts, maps, or\nany other similar medium; (iii)\nthe\nposting of material on billboards, buildings, or vehicles; (iv)\nthe sale of time in radio or television\nbroadcasts; or\n(v) the sale of\nspace on a Web page, regardless of the method of compensation paid by the\nadvertiser to the Web site host. (2)\n\nReceipts received for providing an\nadvertising or marketing service. For purposes of this paragraph, an\nadvertising or marketing service includes: (i) consultation on and development of\nadvertising or marketing campaigns; or\n(ii)\nsecuring placement of advertising or\nmarketing materials in various forms of media. (b) Apportionment of receipts from the sale\nof advertising. (1)\n\nThe amount of receipts\nfrom the publishing of advertising in newspapers or periodicals included in New\n\nYork receipts is determined by multiplying such receipts by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the number of newspapers and periodicals containing such\nadvertising delivered to points within New York State and the denominator of\nwhich is the total number of newspapers and periodicals delivered to points\nwithin and without New York State. 100% of such receipts are included in\neverywhere receipts. (2)\n(i) The amount of receipts from the sale of\nspace on other physical media included in New York receipts is determined by\nmultiplying such receipts by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number\nof New York State locations of such media and the denominator of which is the\ntotal number of locations within and without New York State. 100% of such\nreceipts are included in everywhere receipts. (ii)\n\nIf the physical media is rolling stock, such as buses, vans, or automobiles, the numerator of the fraction in\nsubparagraph (i) is the number of miles operated within New York State and the\ndenominator is the number of total miles operated within and without New York\n\nState. (iii)\n\nExamples. Example 1: Billboard Company owns 15 roadside billboards, 5 in New York State and 10 in State A. For a fee, Billboard Company will post\nadvertisements from unrelated businesses for a determined length of time. It\nreceives $150,000 from Selling Corp to allow advertisements on each of its\nbillboards. Billboard Company must determine the amount of receipts included in\n\nNew York receipts according to the ratio of billboards in New York State to all\nbillboards. Therefore, it includes $50,000 (1/3 x $150,000) in New York\nreceipts. All $150,000 is included in everywhere receipts. Example 2: Bus Company allows businesses to post\nadvertisements on the exterior and interior of its vehicles. It receives $7,000\nfrom Company A, $4,000 from Company B, and $14,000 from Company C to have its\nvehicles display ads for those businesses. Bus Company knows the mileage within\nand without New York State for each of the vehicles containing the ads. Buses\ncontaining ads for Company A travel 30,000 miles in New York State out of a\ntotal of 60,000 miles (50% of its miles in New York). Buses containing ads for\n\nCompany B travel 14,000 miles in New York State out of a total of 70,000 miles\n(20% of its miles in New York). Buses containing ads for Company C travel\n40,000 miles, exclusively in New York State (100% of its miles are in New\n\nYork). Bus Company must include $18,300 in New York receipts, which is the sum\nof $3,500 from Company A (50% multiplied by $7,000), $800 from Company B (20%\nmultiplied by $4,000), and $14,000 from Company C. All $25,000 is included in\neverywhere receipts. (3)\n\nThe amount of receipts from the sale of\nadvertising time in radio or television broadcasts included in New York\nreceipts is determined by multiplying such receipts by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the number of listeners or viewers in New York State and\nthe denominator of which is the total number of listeners or viewers within and\nwithout New York State. 100% of such receipts are included in everywhere\nreceipts. (4)\n(i) The amount of receipts from the sale of\nadvertising not described above and furnished, provided, or delivered to, or\naccessed by the viewer or listener through the use of wire, cable, fiber-optic, laser, microwave, radio wave, satellite or similar successor media or any\ncombination thereof included in New York receipts is determined by multiplying\nsuch receipts by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of listeners\nor viewers in New York State and the denominator of which is the total number\nof listeners or viewers within and without New York State. 100% of such\nreceipts are included in everywhere receipts. (ii)\n\nIf, after exercising due diligence, the\ncorporation lacks sufficient information to apply subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, it may use a reasonable method to estimate the numbers of listeners\nor viewers to include in the numerator and denominator of the fraction\ndescribed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Such method should be based on\ndata available to the corporation either as part of its operations, such as\nmetrics or information for account holders, subscribers, or page or\nadvertisement hits, or under the terms of the contract with the entity seeking\nto place the ad, such as any contractual obligations to identify ad recipients\nor to target the ad to specific demographics. (iii)\n\nIn any case in which a corporation uses\na method of estimation to determine the amounts for the numerator and\ndenominator of the fraction described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and\nthe commissioner determines that the method employed by the corporation is not\nreasonable, the commissioner may substitute a method that the commissioner\ndetermines is appropriate. In this instance, the corporation bears the burden\nof demonstrating that the method the commissioner prescribes is not\nreasonable. (iv)\n\nIn any case in\nwhich the commissioner determines that a corporation's method is reasonable, but that it has not been applied in a consistent manner with respect to similar\ntransactions, the commissioner may require that the corporation apply its\nmethod in a consistent manner. (v) Example. Web Corp provides digital advertisements for various\nretail corporations on its website. Its books and records capture a variety of\nadvertising metrics for each ad placed, which include, but are not limited to, the number of times an ad is viewed by an IP address, the number of unique IP\naddresses that view an ad, and the number of times Web Corp's users click on an\nad and are directed to the retailer's website based on the users' IP\naddress. Web Corp enters into an agreement with Retail Corp A to\nprovide digital advertisements for Retail Corp A on Web Corp's website. Pursuant to the agreement, Web Corp will receive payment each time the\nadvertisement is viewed, regardless of whether the ad is viewed from the same\nlocation multiple times or whether the Web Corp's users click on the\nadvertisement or not. As the receipt is earned based on the number of views, the amount of receipts from Retail Corp A included in New York receipts is\ndetermined by multiplying the total receipts by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the total number of views of the advertisement in New York State and\nthe denominator is the total view of the advertisements. 100% of such receipts\nare included in everywhere receipts. Web Corp enters into an agreement with Retail Corp B to\nprovide digital advertisements for Retail Corp on Web Corp's website. Pursuant\nto the agreement, Web Corp will receive payment each time Web Corp's users\nclick on the advertisement and are directed to Retail Corp B's website. No\npayment is received by Web Corp if the ad is just viewed on Web Corp's website. As the receipt is based on the number of times the ad is clicked on, the amount\nof Web Corp's receipts from Retail Corp B included in New York receipts is\ndetermined by multiplying the total receipts by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the total number of times that Retail Corp B's ad is clicked on in New\n\nYork State and the denominator is the total number of times Retail Corp B's ad\nis clicked on. The location where an ad is clicked on is based upon the IP\naddress. 100% of such receipts are included in everywhere receipts. (c) Apportionment of receipts from advertising services. (1)\n\nThe amount of receipts from the provision\nof advertising or marketing services (e.g., the creation and/or implementation\nof an advertising or marketing campaign) included in New York receipts is\ndetermined by multiplying such receipts by a fraction, the numerator of which\nis the number of intended targets of such advertising or marketing in New York\n\nState and the denominator of which is the total number of intended targets\n(\"the intended target fraction\"). 100% of such receipts are included in\neverywhere receipts. (2)\n\nTo\ndetermine the proper ratio of New York State to everywhere targets for the\nintended targets fraction, a corporation must primarily rely on statistics and\ninformation that are compiled or utilized as part of the market research and\nadvertising strategy developed by the corporation for its customer. If no such\nstatistics or information are available, a corporation may then use other\nsources of information that attempt to determine the location of the intended\ntargets. (i) In any case in which a\ncorporation uses a method to determine the location of the intended targets and\nthe commissioner determines that the method employed by the corporation is not\nreasonable, the commissioner may substitute a method that the commissioner\ndetermines is appropriate. In this instance, the corporation bears the burden\nof demonstrating that the method the commissioner prescribes is not\nreasonable. (ii)\n\nIn any case in\nwhich the commissioner determines that a corporation's method is reasonable, but that it has not been applied in a consistent manner with respect to similar\ntransactions, the commissioner shall require that the corporation apply its\nmethod in a consistent manner. (iii)\n\nExamples. Example 1: Advert Corp is hired by Blower Corp to develop\nan advertising and marketing plan to increase sales of Blower Corp's snow\nblowers in the Northeast, which is a sales region defined by Blower Corp. In\ndeveloping the campaign, Advert Corp obtains information from Blower Corp about\nthe locations of Blower Corp's shipments of its units to retailers and, in some\ncases, directly to consumers in the Northeast sales region. The ratio of\nshipments to New York State locations to shipments to all Northeast locations\nis a reasonable method of determining the distribution of the intended targets\nof Advert Corp's advertising and marketing strategy. Advert Corp should\nmultiply the receipt it receives from Blower Corp by this ratio to determine\nthe amount of the receipt to include in New York receipts. 100% of such\nreceipts are included in everywhere receipts. Example 2: Advert Corp is hired by Finance Corp to\nproduce a nationwide advertising campaign to create demand for Finance Corp's\nnew investment product marketed to retirees. Finance Corp will not divulge\nlocation information about any of its account holders, except to say that it\nhas account holders in every state. Advert Corp has access to information that\nshows the distribution of Americans of or nearing retirement age in each state. Advert Corp should multiply the receipts it receives from Finance Corp by the\nratio of such Americans in New York State to all such Americans to determine\nthe amount of the receipt to include in New York receipts. 100% of such\nreceipts are included in everywhere receipts. Example 3: AdCo works with local businesses to create\nprinted advertisements that appear on paper placemats at restaurants. Businesses pay AdCo to design the ads and to secure their inclusion on\nplacemats. Once the content and design of the ad is agreed upon, AdCo works\nwith a printing company that produces the placemats to ensure that the ad\nappears on the printed placemats and that it meets the design and content\nspecifications. As part of AdCo's responsibilities in providing this service, it determines the locations where the printed placemats will be delivered. AdCo\nreceives a receipt from Landscaper Co to create an ad to be included on\nplacemats. AdCo determines that the placemats will be delivered to Restaurant\n\nCompany, which has 3 restaurants in New York State and 1 in State B (4 total\nrestaurants). AdCo must include 75% of the receipts earned from Landscaper Co\nfor designing and securing the ad on the placemats in its New York receipts. 100% of such receipts are included in everywhere receipts. (3)\n\nWhere a lump sum is received\nby the corporation as payment for advertising or marketing services and such\nadvertising or marketing services consists of a combination of activities\nincluding the creating of the advertising or marketing campaign and the actual\npurchase of advertising space or time, the corporation must allocate the lump\nsum among each of the types of activities based on both the costs of purchasing\nthe advertising or marketing space or time and the intended targets of the\nadvertising or marketing or by some other reasonable method. Full details must\nbe submitted with the corporation's report. (i) Example. Advert Corp is hired by School Supply Corp to develop an\nadvertising and marketing plan to increase sales of students' school supplies\nat its retail stores. The campaign will use newspapers ads, television\ncommercials, and in-store promotions. Advert Corp will receive one lump sum for\nthe entire advertising and marketing campaign. It first determines how to\nallocate the lump sum among the various advertising strategies by multiplying\nthe lump sum by a fraction, the numerator of which is the cost of employing the\nparticular medium, (i.e., the cost of placing ads in newspapers), and the\ndenominator of which is the total cost of employing all the forms of media\noutreach (i.e., the sum of the cost of ad buys in newspapers, ad buys on\ntelevision, and deploying in-store promotions). To determine the amount of each allocated amount of the\nlump sum to be included in New York receipts, the amount of each allocated\namount of the lump sum is then multiplied by its own intended target fraction\nas described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Thus, for newspaper ad buys, the allocated amount of the lump sum included in New York receipts is based on\nthe ratio of the New York State circulation of the newspapers containing the ad\nbuys to the total circulation of such newspapers where the inserts will appear. For the television ad buys, the allocated amount of the lump sum included in\n\nNew York receipts is based on the ratio of viewers in New York State to the\ntotal number of viewers within the region where the ad buys will be broadcast. For the in-store promotions, the allocated amount of the lump sum included in\n\nNew York receipts is based on the ratio of New York State stores engaging in\nthe promotions to all stores engaging in the promotions. 100% of such receipts\nare included in everywhere receipts.
