  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1700.7 - Liability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Property\nlast in control of the inmate. When property was last in the control of the inmate, there is\nno presumption that its unexplained loss is the fault of the department or its\nagents, without further showing that the loss was caused by the negligence of\nthe department or its agents. The department's staff would be negligent if it\nfailed to carry out in an acceptable way its responsibility to take reasonable\nsteps to protect the inmate's property. Examples of negligence by the\ndepartment or its agents include, among other things: (1)\nfailure to follow required procedures\nwhich failure permits another person to steal, damage or destroy an inmate's\nproperty; or\n(2)\nnegligently\ncreating a flood, fire or other accident which causes a loss. (b) Property last in control\nof the department. When an inmate's property was last in the control of the\ndepartment or its agents, and the department fails without good explanation to\ndeliver it in to the inmate or the inmate's designee in the same condition as\nwhen received by the department, then there is a rebuttable presumption that\nthe department is negligently responsible for the loss. (1)\n\nTo rebut the presumption of negligence, the reviewer must determine that all department staff who had a duty to protect\nthe inmate's property carried out their duties in an acceptable way. If that is\nnot shown or if it is shown that the department's staff failed to meet their\nresponsibilities, then the department will be deemed to have been negligent. (i) Shipment. When an inmate's property is\nlost in the process of shipment from a department facility by department staff\nthere is a rebuttable presumption of negligence by the department. The\npresumption may be rebutted if the investigation shows: (a) that the department did not receive the\nproperty for shipment; (b) that the\ndepartment received the property but delivered it to a shipper who could\nreasonably be expected to deliver it in good condition to its intended\ndestination; or\n(c) that the\nproperty was received at its intended destination in the same condition as when\nreceived by the department. (c) Comparative liability of the inmate\nclaimant. If the investigation reveals that there was negligence on the\npart of both the department or its agents and on the part of the inmate\nclaimant, then the claims reviewer must determine a percentage allocation of\nnegligence causing the loss, and use that percentage in calculating the proper\namount to be paid.
