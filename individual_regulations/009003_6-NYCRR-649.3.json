(c) Projects shall be\nlisted in the IUP according to their rank on the PPL and within project\ncategories. Project categories A through D relate solely to municipal projects. Categories A through C are determined solely be the number of people who reside\nwithin the municipality's jurisdiction based upon the latest census figures\npublished by the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census. Category D relates to municipal projects which are determined to be ESPs which\nqualify for a reduced interest rate direct financing because of financial\nhardship as determined under 21 NYCRR section 2602.6. Category E relates solely\nto non-municipally owned projects. Category G relates to projects or portions\nthereof that address green infrastructure, including, without limitation, water\nand energy efficiency improvements, or other environmentally innovative\nactivities. The project categories shall be: (1)\n\nCategory A--all municipalities where\npopulation is identified as 3,500 or less. (2)\n\nCategory B--all municipalities where\npopulation is identified as being 3,501 through 2,000,000.

To the extent such remaining available funds exceed the\nneed in each category, those funds will be made available for use as provided\nin paragraph (7) of this subdivision.

For\npurposes of this paragraph, a region is any of the geographic areas of the\n\nState served by a regional office of the department, except that department\nregions 5 and 6 shall together be treated as a single region.
