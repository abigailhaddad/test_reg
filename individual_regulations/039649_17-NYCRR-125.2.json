  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 125.2 - Permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person, institution, corporation, or other entity desiring permanent or temporary\naccess to a State highway shall obtain a work permit from the department to\nprovide an entrance and/or exit. (b) Written application for such permit shall\nbe made to the regional director of the department through the appropriate\ncounty resident engineer or traffic and safety group and shall be accompanied\nby plans, drawings or a sketch indicating the work proposed including the\napplicable design dimensions required. Applications for work permits will be\naccepted only from property owners or their authorized agents. Certification of\nlegal ownership or owner's authorization may be required. On approval of the\napplication by the department, a permit will be issued stipulating conditions\nunder which the installation is to be performed. (c) If a property owner, lessee or agent, fails to comply with the terms of a permit or to obtain a permit, the\ndepartment may halt the activity for which a permit is required until adequate\ncorrections have been made. Costs incurred by the department in correcting\nfailures to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, failures to\nobtain a permit, or defective workmanship or materials shall be borne by the\npermittee or person undertaking the activity. The provisions of this Part shall\nnot apply to entrances already in existence on July 31, 1983, but shall apply\nto any improvements of existing driveway connections within the State highway\nright-of-way made after August 1, 1983. Improvement is defined as resurfacing, replacement of existing pipe or a change in width, grade or location of an\nexisting driveway. (d) Whenever a\n\nState highway is reconstructed or resurfaced, existing entrances to the highway\nshall be altered by the department at its expense to conform to the spirit and\nintent of the policy and standards set forth in this Part. (e) Whenever a change or expansion of a\nbusiness results in increased traffic on the State highway system through a\ndriveway, it may be necessary for the owner to improve the driveway and/or\nhighway including any signalization and/or widening needed for the safe flow of\ntraffic. In a few instances, any driveway control may cause severe hardship to\nthe property owner. In such cases, exceptions to the policy may be considered\nto permit existing driveway entrances to remain unaltered where this is not\nlikely to interfere with free and safe flow of traffic on the highway. For\nnon-capital projects and capital resurfacing projects any exceptions are to be\nconsidered by the regional director. On capital projects which the regional\noffice is not responsible for progressing, the regional director shall submit\nthe following information to the director of the Facilities Design Division at\nleast two months prior to the PS&E target date: (1)\nA sketch at an appropriate scale, with\nphotographs showing existing conditions. (2)\n\nAn explanation of the severe economic\nhardship that would be imposed on the owner if the driveway were altered to\nmeet the requirements of this Part. (3)\n\nThe basis for the regional director's\nbelief that retention of this nonconforming driveway will not interfere with\nfree and safe flow of traffic. This should cover such things as sight distance, vehicle speeds, traffic volumes, accident history, local parking regulations, and a history of other problems at the site. In cases involving new driveways on the existing highway, where strict application of this policy may create a severe economic hardship\nfor the property owner, the above factors should be considered before a\ndecision to permit any exceptions to the policy is made. (f) Whenever in this Part the\ndiscretion of the commissioner or his representatives is required to be\nexercised, such discretion shall be based upon accepted engineering practices\nand standards. (g) A work permit is\nsubject to the following conditions and limitations: (1)\n\nWork must start within the time period\nspecified in the permit.

Every reasonable effort shall be made to have all\nrequired stipulations and conditions of work specified in the permit before the\nwork begins. If additions or alterations are required after work commences, written department approval shall be secured before any action is\ntaken. (3)\nA permittee shall not\nhold the department liable for any claim for damages arising from his\nnegligence, or his contractor's negligence in operations covered by the permit.
