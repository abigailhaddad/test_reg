If a\nback-up SLO was not developed, then the teacher's/principal's overall composite\nscore and rating shall be based on the portions of their annual professional\nperformance review not affected by the nullification of the State-provided\ngrowth score. Provided, however, that following a successful appeal under\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section, if a back-up SLO is used a teacher/principal\nshall not receive a score/rating higher than developing on such SLO.

(f) Nothing in this Subpart shall be construed to authorize a teacher/principal to\ncommence the appeal process prior to receipt of his/her overall rating from the\ndistrict/BOCES. (g) During the\npendency of an appeal under this section, nothing shall be construed to alter\nthe obligation of a school district/BOCES to develop and implement a teacher\nimprovement plan or principal improvement plan during the pendency of an\nappeal. (h) Nothing in this section\nshall be construed to limit any rights of a teacher/principal under section\n30-2.11\nof this Subpart.
