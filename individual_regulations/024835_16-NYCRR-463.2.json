  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 463.2 - Steam plant to be recorded at original cost\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All amounts included in subaccounts of\naccounts 101 to 104 for steam plant (except as otherwise provided in account\n302, Franchises and Consents) shall be the original cost (see §\n460.1\n[a][27]\n) of\nsuch steam plant. (b) When the term\ncost is used in the detailed steam plant accounts, it shall mean the original\ncost unless otherwise specified and shall include not only the materials, supplies, labor, services and other items consumed or employed in the\nconstruction and installation of steam plant, but also the cost of preliminary\nstudies, plans, surveys, engineering, supervision, and general expenses, which\ncontribute directly and immediately to steam plant without duplication of such\ncosts. (c) When the consideration\ngiven for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be\ndetermined on a cash basis. In the entry recording such transaction the actual\nconsideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish the commission the particulars of its\ndetermination of the cash value of the consideration, if other than\ncash. (d) When property is\npurchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to\nthe steam plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures\noccasioned solely by such form of payment. (e) Steam plant contributed to the utility or\nconstructed by it from contributions to it of cash or its equivalent shall be\ncharged to the steam plant accounts at cost (see §\n460.1, subd. [a][13]) to the\nutility (i.e., original cost less the portion thereof contributed by or on\nbehalf of customers). Records shall be kept so that the utility can readily\nfurnish information as to the source, purpose, and amount of each contribution, the property to which each contribution relates, and the conditions, if any, upon which each contribution was made. Note A:Amounts received for construction which are\nultimately to be refunded, wholly or in part, shall be credited to account 241, Customers' Advances for Construction. When the amount to be refunded has been\nfinally determined, the balance, if any, remaining in account 241 shall be\ndebited thereto and credited to the steam plant accounts to which the cost of\nthe property was charged. Note B:Amounts in account 265, Contributions in Aid of\n\nConstruction, as of the effective date of this amendment, which are applicable\nto and can be identified with property in service or held for future use, shall\nbe transferred to the accounts in which the cost of such property is carried. The balance, if any, remaining in account 265, Contributions in Aid of\n\nConstruction, shall be transferred to account 250, Reserve for Depreciation of\n\nSteam Plant (or account 253.1, Reserve for Depreciation and Amortization of\n\nOther Utility Plant, or 253.2, Reserve for Depreciation and Amortization of\n\nCommon Utility Plant, if appropriate), unless the commission approves or\ndirects other disposition.
