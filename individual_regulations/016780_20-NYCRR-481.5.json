  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 481.5 - Gross weight method, optional method of computing the tax on tractors and trailers\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 503, subd. 2\n(a) If a carrier operates tractor-trailer\ncombinations he may elect in his return to compute the tax by one of the two\nmethods set forth below: (1)\n\nCompute the tax\nfor each separate tractor and trailer combination operated as a unit, based on\nthe mileage and the unloaded weight of tractor and the maximum gross weight of\nthe trailer as set forth in section\n481.4, supra; or\n(2)\n\nCompute the tax for each trailer based on the mileage of the trailer. In\nelecting to report under this option, the carrier does not report the maximum\ngross weight of each individual tractor and trailer combination but, instead, reports on the basis of \"combination weight\". If operated with a load, the\nmaximum gross combination weight to be reported is the maximum gross weight for\neach trailer plus the unloaded weight of the heaviest tractor owned by, interchanged with or leased to the carrier during the reporting period for\nwhich a permit is required under article 21 of the Tax Law. If operated without\nany load whatsoever, the unloaded combination weight to be reported is the\nunloaded weight of each trailer plus the unloaded weight of the heaviest\ntractor owned by, interchanged with or leased to the carrier during the\nreporting period for which a permit is required under article 21 of the Tax\n\nLaw. If the unloaded combination weight is less than 18,001 pounds, no tax is\npayable on any mileage operated by the trailer when empty. (See §\n481.6, infra. ) If the heaviest tractor leased to a carrier was not\noperated in New York State during the reporting period, such tractor may be\ndisregarded for purposes of \"combination weight\" unless the carrier was\nrequired to obtain a permit for such tractor. (b) A carrier electing either of the above\nmethods of reporting must use such method of reporting on all vehicles used\nduring the taxable period. Such election shall be irrevocable with respect to\nthe reporting period for which the return is filed. Example: If a carrier operates three tractors the unloaded weight\nof each of which is as follows: Tractor A\n12,200 pounds\n\nTractor B\n11,200 pounds\n\nTractor C\n10,954 pounds\nand three trailers the maximum gross weight of each of\nwhich is as follows: Trailer X\n49,600 pounds\n\nTrailer Y\n44,000 pounds\n\nTrailer Z\n40,000 pounds\nand each combination traveled 100 laden miles on the\npublic highways of this State during the period, the tax may be computed as\nfollows: Option\nA: Tractor\n\nTrailer\n\nMaximum G.W.
