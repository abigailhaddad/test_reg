The budget must reflect current wage rates and payroll tax rates applicable for the budgeted year, and reasonably anticipated\nincreases, or increases now mandated by contract. If applicable, state the expiration dates of all union contracts. If there is non-union labor in\nthe development, discuss whether their wages meet minimum wage laws. In the case of an occupied nonresidential development, if the budget reflects a\nreduction in the existing staff, disclose what effect this will have on the existing level of services and whether such reduction is\nlawful. (ii)\n\nHeating, cooling, and hot water costs. State the type and quantity of energy projected to be\nused during the year and the projected cost per gallon or other pricing unit inclusive of sales tax for all energy costs for providing heat, air\nconditioning, and hot water to the HOA property.

State the quantity of energy purchased in each of the three prior years, the average cost per gallon\nor other pricing unit and the total cost per year. The Department of Law may, from time to time, issue pricing guidelines to reflect minimum fuel\ncosts. (iii)\n\nUtilities (\ne.g., electricity and gas).

Unit cost should be based on the current tariff plus a reasonably anticipated increase which\nshould be set forth, e.g., estimates based on current tariffs plus 10 percent increase. State which services will be provided by or\nthrough the board of directors and which must be obtained directly by home or lot owners. In the case of an occupied nonresidential building, unless\nit would be misleading for a particular development, base the projected quantity of the utilities on the average quantity of the utilities purchased\nfor the prior three years. (iv)\n\nWater charges and sewer rents. State the basis for the projection.

(viii)\n\nSnow removal and refuse removal. State the services to be provided and the basis for the projected\ncosts. (ix)\n\nInsurance. If HOA property includes buildings or if the HOA is providing common fire\ninsurance on homes, the budget for insurance must provide for fire and casualty insurance under an agreed amount replacement cost policy or under a\npolicy including at least an 80 percent co-insurance provision so that the insured shall not be a co-insurer. Discuss the adequacy of the insurance\nto replace the structure in the event of total loss and to avoid being a co-insurer in the event of partial loss. If the homes of the HOA members are\nattached and common fire insurance coverage is not required, highlight as a special risk the consequences which could result if an uninsured or\nunderinsured unit is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty. (\nNote: If common fire and casualty insurance is mandatory, provision should be made in the declaration or by-laws to require mortgage holders to waive their customary right to apply insurance proceeds to the\nmortgage indebtedness.) Disclose the items covered, the coverage amount limits, the deductibles and the exposure insured against. (a) If the sponsor is in control of the board the budget for insurance must provide for and the HOA must have\npublic liability insurance at closing. If no public liability insurance is provided, and if the HOA owns or maintains property, such failure to\nprovide this insurance must be highlighted as a special risk. (b) State that the insurance coverage meets\nthe requirements of any mortgage lender procured by the sponsor. (c) State that if there is common fire, casualty and general liability insurance, it must be on terms that provide: (1)\nthat each homeowner is an\nadditional insured party if casualty insurance covers the individual homes; (2)\nthat there will be no\ncancellation without notice to the board of directors; (3)\na waiver of subrogation; (4)\na waiver of invalidity because of the acts of the insured and homeowners; and\n(5)\na waiver of pro rata reduction if homeowners obtain additional coverage. (d) If the following items are not included in the budget and are applicable to the offering, state that coverage\nfor them is not included and may be available at extra cost: officers' and directors' liability; rent insurance; water damage; elevator collision; boiler and machinery; excess liability; auto liability; fidelity bond; and garage keeper's liability. (e) The plan must alert homeowners to the desirability of obtaining additional insurance at their own cost to cover such risks as fire and casualty\nlosses to contents of the home, and liability coverage for occurrences within the home. (x) Management fees. State the basis for the projected management fee. The projected cost must include any costs required by the terms of the management\nagreement, such as bonding. Highlight as a special risk if the cost of the management contract is greater or substantially less than the prevailing\ncost for similar services, and state the prevailing cost which would be charged for these services. If no manager or management contract is provided\nfor in the budget, highlight as a special risk, state the services that homeowners will have to provide and disclose that maintenance charges will\nincrease if the HOA retains a managing agent in the future. (xi)\n\nLegal fees and audit fees. If the\nbudgeted amount for legal fees is less than $5,000, the footnote must indicate the extent to which legal services are budgeted. Audit fees must be\nbased on and refer to a fee quotation from a certified public accountant for preparing the yearly certified financial statement for the\nHOA. (xii)\n\nReal estate taxes. State the assessing authority, the projected assessed valuation and the\nbasis for such valuation, the tax rate and the projected amounts to be paid. If the assessing authority or legal counsel renders an opinion that the\nassessed valuation of the HOA property will be reflected in the assessed valuation of the individual lots or homes, real estate taxes may be budgeted\nat zero ($0). If no opinion is available, include an expert's projection of assessed valuation at Exhibit B-10, and budget for real estate taxes\nbased on the projected assessed valuation. (xiii)\n\nFranchise or corporate taxes, income taxes and sales\ntaxes. Include in the budget if taxes are payable by the HOA pursuant to State or local law, or under Federal income tax law, or furnish proof, by\nopinion of counsel or confirmation from taxing authorities, that the HOA is not subject to such taxes pursuant to such laws. (xiv)\n\nReserve. Some HOAs will be responsible for replacing roofs, repainting unit exteriors, resurfacing parking\nareas and roadways. These items will require special assessments unless reserves are built into the annual budget taking into account the life of the\nitems. A reserve should be set aside for this purpose, or the probability of incurring substantial special assessments in the future indicating the\nreplacement cost of the items should be highlighted as a special risk. The footnote must indicate the expected life of the item, the projected\nreplacement cost and the calculation of the amounts to be placed in reserve each year. (xv)\n\nNote: Roadways and sewers. The budget does not have to include road maintenance if roads are dedicated to the local government. The cost of sewage disposal\ndoes not have to be included if it is part of a local government sewer system. If the roads have not been dedicated when the plan is submitted or if\nthe local government is not operating the sewer system when the plan is submitted, sponsor must state approximately when the local government will\nassume responsibility, whether there are any conditions precedent, and whether any completion bonds have been posted. If the local government will\nnot assume responsibility until after the first closing, sponsor must either budget maintenance costs or agree to bear the cost of maintenance and\noperation until the local government assumes responsibility and indicate whether security has been posted to guarantee performance of this financial\nobligation. (xvi)\n\nOther expenses. Include additional expenses such as association dues, HOA telephone\nexpenses, license fees, registrations, permits, contingencies and miscellaneous expenses, including interest.

No report need be filed for a fiscal year which ends less than three months prior\nto the date the proposed offering plan is submitted to the Department of Law. If the development has been in operation for less than two years, include a statement for the period since the development began operations. If, after the plan is filed but before it is declared effective, a more\nrecent fiscal year has ended and the sponsor has had three months after that to prepare a certified statement, sponsor must amend the plan to include\nthe certified statement for the more recent fiscal year. (1)\n\nThe accountant's certification must: (i) State that the examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and included such\ntests of the accounting records and other auditing procedures as the accountant considered necessary in the circumstances.

(1)\n\nState whether the sponsor may rent any unit that is vacant before the closing. (2)\n\nState whether an uncured default under the purchase agreement is a default under the lease and whether an\nuncured default under the lease is a default under the purchase agreement. If an uncured default under the lease can result in a default under the\npurchase agreement, state that before the sponsor may utilize the default under the lease to declare a default under the purchase agreement, the\nsponsor must either obtain an order of eviction or other judgment or order from a court or agency of competent jurisdiction against the lessee unless\nthe lessee has vacated the unit. (3)\n\nState the length of time the interim lessee has to vacate the unit\nafter a default under the purchase agreement or rescission of the purchase agreement by the lessee.

The sponsor shall comply with the escrow and trust fund requirements of\n\nGeneral Business Law sections 352-e(2-b) and 352-h and these regulations, and all funds paid by purchasers shall be handled in accordance with these\nstatutes and regulations. (2)\n\nEscrow, trust fund. The following requirements shall apply to all offerings and shall be\nfully disclosed in all offering plans subject to this Part: (i) Mandatory escrow agreement. All deposits, down payments, or advances made by purchasers prior to closing of each individual transaction shall be held pursuant to a written agreement entered\ninto between the sponsor, the purchaser, and the escrow agent. Said provisions may be included in a separate escrow agreement or in the purchase\nagreement entered into between the sponsor, the purchaser and the escrow agent, and are referred to in this paragraph as the \"escrow agreement.\" The\nplan must set forth the material terms of the escrow agreement.

The plan and escrow agreement must include language\nconforming to subparagraphs (v)-(vii) of this paragraph. However, the failure to include such language in the plan or escrow agreement shall not\nexcuse the sponsor and the escrow agent from compliance with said subparagraphs. (ii)\n\nPayments. All funds\nreceived from purchasers whether in the form of checks, drafts, money orders, wire transfers, or other instruments which identify the payor, shall be\nmade payable to or endorsed by the purchaser to the order of the attorney or law firm as escrow agent. (iii)\n\nThe escrow agent. The escrow agent must be an attorney or firm of attorneys admitted to practice in the State\nof New York or an attorney admitted in a foreign jurisdiction who submits to the jurisdiction of the State of New York for any cause of action\narising out of the escrow provisions set forth in the escrow agreement. The authorized signatories on any escrow account must be attorneys admitted\nto practice in the State of New York or admitted in a foreign jurisdiction who submit to the jurisdiction of the State of New York for any cause of\naction arising out of the escrow provisions set forth in the escrow agreement. Neither the escrow agent nor any authorized signatory on any account\nmay be the sponsor, the selling agent, the managing agent, or a principal thereof. However, a law firm that has a member who is a principal may be\nthe escrow agent provided that members of the firm who are signatories on any account are not themselves principals. Only an attorney or a member of\na firm acting as escrow agent shall be a signatory on any account and only such attorney shall be authorized to release funds. The name, address and\ntelephone number of the escrow agent and of each attorney who is a signatory must be stated in the plan. (iv)\n\nThe account(s). All deposits, down payments, or advances made by purchasers prior to closing of each\nindividual transaction, whether received before or after the date of consummation of the plan, must be placed within five business days after the\nescrow agreement is signed by all necessary parties in an attorney's segregated special escrow account or accounts in a bank or banks doing business\nin the State of New York which account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"). Sponsor shall state the applicable FDIC\ninsurance limits, whether and to what extent the deposits, down payments, or advances are insured, and whether sponsor may utilize more than one\nsegregated special account for each deposit, down payment, or advance. Include as a special risk that deposits in excess of said limits will not be\nfederally insured. An attorney shall open and maintain any such account in his or her own name, or in the name of a firm of attorneys of which he or\nshe is a member, or in the name of the attorney or firm of attorneys by whom he or she is employed, separate from such attorney's personal accounts\nor from any accounts in which assets belonging to the firm are deposited, and separate from any accounts maintained in the capacity of executor, guardian, trustee or receiver.

Funds must be placed in an interest-bearing account or accounts, with all interest\ncredited to the purchaser, unless the sponsor elects to place the funds in a separate Interest-on-Lawyer's-Account (\"IOLA\") for each plan pursuant to\n\nJudiciary Law section 497. T he plan shall indicate whether the interest rate to be earned will be the prevailing rate for such accounts. State the\ncurrent prevailing rate and when interest will begin to accrue. No fees of any kind may be deducted from any account principal or any interest earned\nthereon. Sponsor shall bear any administrative cost for maintenance of any account. (v) Notification to\npurchaser. Within 10 business days after the escrow agreement is signed by all necessary parties, the escrow agent shall notify the purchaser that\nsuch funds have been deposited in the bank indicated in the plan, and shall provide any account number and the initial interest rate. If the\npurchaser does not receive notice of such deposit within 15 business days after tender of the deposit, he or she may cancel the purchase and rescind\nwithin 90 days after tender of the deposit. Complaints concerning the failure to honor such cancellation requests may be referred to the New York\n\nState Department of Law, Real Estate Finance Bureau, 120 Broadway, 23rd Floor, New York, N.Y. 10271. Rescission may not be afforded where proof\nsatisfactory to the Attorney General is submitted establishing that the escrowed funds were timely deposited in accordance with these regulations and\nrequisite notice was timely mailed to the purchaser. (vi)\n\nEscrow revisions. Before funds are transferred\nto any new escrow account, or if the escrow agent is replaced, the plan must be amended to provide the same full disclosure with respect to any new\naccount, the escrow agent and the escrow agreement as was originally provided. A bond, letter of credit or other security may be substituted for any\nescrow account only after the Department of Law approves in writing the use of such alternate form of security, pursuant to the provisions of\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision\net seq. (vii)\n\nRelease of funds. The escrow agreement\nand the plan must set forth the requirements and procedures for the release of the escrowed funds. These shall include: (a) Under no circumstances shall sponsor seek release of the escrowed funds of a defaulting purchaser until after\nconsummation of the plan. Consummation of the plan does not relieve the sponsor of its obligations pursuant to General Business Law section\n352-h. (b) The escrow agent shall release the funds if so directed: (1)\npursuant to terms and conditions set forth in the escrow agreement upon closing of the individual transaction; (2)\nin a subsequent writing signed by both sponsor and purchaser; (3)\nby a final, non-appealable order or judgment of a court; or\n(4)\nby a final, non-reviewable determination\nof the Attorney General pursuant to subparagraph (viii) of this paragraph so long as the purchase agreement provides for dispute resolution by the\n\nAttorney General and was signed on or before March 1, 2013. (c) If the escrowed funds are not\nreleased pursuant to clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, and the escrow agent receives a request by either party to release the funds, the escrow agent must give both parties prior written notice of not fewer than 30 days before releasing said funds. If the escrow agent has not\nreceived notice of objection to the release of the funds at the expiration of the 30-day period, the funds shall be released and the escrow agent\nshall provide further written notice to both parties informing them of said release. If the escrow agent receives a written notice from either party\nobjecting to the release of the escrowed funds within said 30-day period, the escrow agent shall continue to hold said funds until otherwise directed\npursuant to clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph. However, the escrow agent shall also have the right at any time to deposit the funds\ncontained in any escrow account with the clerk of a court in the county in which the interest offered pursuant to the plan is located and shall give\nwritten notice to both parties of such deposit. (d) The sponsor shall not object to the release of the\nescrowed funds to: (1)\na purchaser who timely rescinds in accordance with an offer of rescission contained in the\nplan or an amendment to the plan; or\n(2)\nall purchasers after an amendment abandoning the plan is\naccepted for filing by the Department of Law. (viii)\n\nDisputes. (a) In the event of a dispute arising in connection with a purchase agreement providing for dispute resolution by\nthe Attorney General that was signed on or before March 1, 2013, the sponsor shall apply and the purchaser or the escrow agent holding the down\npayments in escrow may apply to the Attorney General for a determination on the disposition of the down payment and any interest earned thereon. Forms for this purpose will be available from the Department of Law. A copy of such form shall be annexed as an exhibit in Part II of the plan. The\nparty applying shall contemporaneously send to all other parties a copy of such application. (b) Pending\nthe determination of the Attorney General to grant or deny the application, the sponsor, the purchaser and the escrow agent shall abide by any\ninterim directive issued by the Attorney General. (c) If the application permitting release of funds is\ngranted, the deposit and any interest earned thereon shall be disposed of in accordance with a final, non-reviewable determination of the Attorney\n\nGeneral. (d) The Attorney General shall act upon the application within 30 days after its submission to\nthe Department of Law, by either making a determination or notifying the parties that an extension of time in which to do so is necessary for stated\nreasons. (e) If the application seeking release of funds is denied, the escrow agent shall continue to\nhold the deposit and any interest earned thereon until: (1)\nboth the sponsor and purchaser direct payment to a\nspecified party in accordance with a written direction signed by both the sponsor and purchaser; (2)\na\nfinal, non-appealable order or judgment or order of a court is served on the escrow agent; or\n(3)\nthe\nescrow agent deposits the disputed amount into court. (ix)\n\nExhibits to plan. Copies\nof the forms provided by the bank for opening any escrow account and the form of escrow agreement, if separate from the purchase agreement, must be\nincluded as Exhibit B-21 of the submission. (x) Records on file. The escrow agent shall maintain all\nrecords concerning any escrow account for seven years after release of the funds. Upon the dissolution of any law firm which was the escrow agent, the former partners or members of the firm shall make appropriate arrangements for the maintenance of these records by one of them or by the\nsuccessor firm and shall notify the Department of Law of such transfer. (xi)\n\nReview and audit. The\n\nDepartment of Law may perform random reviews and audits of any records involving escrow accounts to determine compliance with statute and\nregulation. (xii)\n\nWaiver void. Any provision of any contract or agreement, whether oral or in writing, by\nwhich a purchaser purports to waive or indemnify any obligation of the escrow agent holding trust funds is absolutely void. The provisions of this\nsection of the regulations shall prevail over any conflicting or inconsistent provision in the offering plan or in a purchase agreement. (xiii)\n\nTrust obligation of sponsor. Nothing contained herein shall diminish or impair the sponsor's statutory\nobligation to each purchaser pursuant to General Business Law section 352-h to hold in trust all deposits, advances or payments made in connection\nwith the offer until consummation of the transaction with such purchaser. Consummation of the plan does not relieve sponsor of its obligations\npursuant to General Business Law section 352-h. Funds from any escrow account remain the property of the purchaser until employed in connection with\nthe consummation of the transaction. Such funds shall not be a part of the estate of the sponsor or the escrow agent upon any bankruptcy, incapacity\nor death. (3)\n\nAlternatives to escrow account. A sponsor may apply to the Attorney General to use security in the form\nof surety bonds or a letter of credit in lieu of escrow of such funds for use in newly constructed or gut rehabilitated developments upon showing of\nadequate insurance of such funds to the satisfaction of the Attorney General.

(iii)\n\nChange from escrow account. Where surety bonds are or a letter of credit is to be\nprovided under an amendment to the plan calling for release of funds already deposited in escrow, the amendment shall provide for, and annex a form\nfor, the written consent of each affected purchaser and shall provide for continuation of escrow of funds of any purchaser who does not execute and\ndeliver such written consent to the sponsor. (iv)\n\nDisclosure. If an application for alternate security is\napproved, the terms of such alternate security shall be disclosed in the plan or in an amendment to the plan promptly submitted.

In order for the application for alternate security to be approved by the Attorney General, the applicant must show that the surety\ncompany with which the sponsor proposes to contract has a current rating for debt securities no lower than the third highest grade conferred by at\nleast two of the national reporting services regularly evaluating insurance companies.

Each surety bond and any accompanying agreement shall provide that it will continue in\neffect or that it will be renewed periodically until consummation and closing of the sale of the respective unit the down payment for which is\nsecured by such surety bond or until the secured funds of a purchaser have been returned in full, or until the funds secured by the surety bond have\nbeen placed in any escrow account pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subdivision or until there is an undisputed purchaser default or a final, non-reviewable determination by the Attorney General or final, non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the\npurchaser has defaulted and that the sponsor is entitled to the secured funds. (vii)\n\nDelivery of the\nsurety bond. The sponsor shall cause the surety to mail or personally deliver the surety bond to the purchaser-obligee before the funds are released\nto the sponsor from any escrow account. The sponsor, the escrow agent and the surety company shall each retain a copy of the surety bond. (viii)\n\nInvoking the bond. The purchaser-obligee shall have the right to demand payment of the amount secured by the\nsurety bond directly from the surety, without first requesting payment from the sponsor.
