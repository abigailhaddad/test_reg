  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 22.1 - Leave of absence; duration\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\npermanent employee, or an employee holding a position by permanent or temporary\nappointment who requests leave because of pregnancy or childbirth, may, in the\ndiscretion of the appointing authority, be granted a leave of absence, without\npay for a period not exceeding two years. Such leave may be extended beyond two\nyears, for periods aggregating not in excess of an additional two years, only\nwith the approval of the Civil Service Commission. In an exceptional case, a\nfurther extension may be permitted by the commission for good cause shown and\nwhere the interests of the government would be served. For the purposes of this\n\nPart, time spent in active service in the military forces of the United States\nor of the State of New York shall not be considered in computing the period of\nleave. (b) This section shall not\nbe construed to require the extension of any employment beyond the time at\nwhich it would otherwise terminate by operation of law, rule or\nregulation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4\n§\n22.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
