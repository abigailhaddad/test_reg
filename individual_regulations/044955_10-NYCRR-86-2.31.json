  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 86-2.31 - Recalibration\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For rate years 1989, 1990 and 1991, notwithstanding any other provision of this Subpart and subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, payment rates shall be adjusted in accordance with this subdivision to reflect a percentage recalibration adjustment based on the change in each facility's case mix which has been determined by the department to be due to factors other than changes in patient population or condition. Such payment rate adjustments shall be implemented utilizing the direct component of facility rates for such rate years determined in accordance with sections 86-2.10 and\n86-2.11\nof this Subpart. (1)\n\nThe percentage recalibration adjustment provided for in this subdivision shall neither exceed 3.035 percent nor be less than 0 percent. (2)\n\nThe percentage recalibration adjustment shall be calculated as follows for each facility. (i) A statewide distribution of patients in each patient classification group shall be determined by utilizing the patient data for the assessment of all patients obtained in the patient assessment period March 1, 1985 through September 30, 1985 (the 1985 period) conducted pursuant to section\n86-2.30\nof this Subpart. (ii)\n\nThe statewide distribution of patients in each patient classification group shall be further segregated by the following length of stay (LOS) groups. (a) less than or equal to 90 days; (b) greater than 90 days but less than or equal to one year; (c) greater than 1 year but less than or equal to two years; (d) greater than two years but less than or equal to three years; (e) greater than three years but less than or equal to four years; (f) greater than four years but less than or equal to five years; or\n(g) greater than five years. (iii)\nA statewide average initial case mix index for each LOS group for the 1985 period shall be calculated by multiplying the initial distribution of patients in each patient classification group within each LOS group times the case mix index for each patient classification group as contained in Appendix 13-A herein and dividing the sum of the results by the total number of patients in all patient classification groups within each LOS group. (iv)\n\nFor each facility, a 1985 distribution of patients in each patient classification group and a 1985 distribution of patients by the LOS groups specified in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph shall be determined by utilizing the patient data for the assessment of all patients obtained in the 1985 period, conducted pursuant to section\n86-2.30\nof this Subpart. In the event a facility commenced operations after the patient assessment period, March 1, 1985 through September 30, 1985 (the 1985 period) but prior to January 1, 1988, or if the facility has the lesser of ten cases or twenty percent of its patients in the distributions as determined in this subparagraph for the 1985 period, or if the facility had undergone the appointment of a receiver or the establishment of a new operator subsequent to the 1985 period but prior to January 1, 1988 and had filed a new cost report in accordance with the provisions of section\n86-2.10\n(k) of this Subpart which was used in the calculation of the payment rate, the distribution of patients to be used for the purposes of this subparagraph shall be that distribution pertaining to the earliest full patient assessment period conducted pursuant to section\n86-2.30\nof this Subpart subsequent to the 1985 period or subsequent to the effective date of the appointment of a receiver or the change in operator (the \"substituted 1985 period\"), and such distribution shall be deemed the facility's \"substituted 1985 distribution\" of patients for the calculations in subparagraphs (vi) and (vii) of this paragraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, the only patients to be included in the distributions shall be patients that have been identified by the department as also having been included in the patient assessment period July 1, 1988 through December 31, 1988. (v) For each facility, a 1988 distribution of patients in each patient classification group and a 1988 distribution of patients by the LOS groups specified in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph shall be determined by utilizing the patient data obtained in the patient assessment period July 1, 1988 through December 31, 1988. For purposes of this subparagraph, the only patients to be included in the distributions shall be patients that were admitted to the facility in which they are presently residing before October 1, 1985 and have been identified by the department as also having been included in the patient assessments during the 1985 period. In the event a facility commenced operations after the patient assessment period, March 1, 1985 through September 30, 1985 (the 1985 period) but prior to January 1, 1988, or if the facility had the lesser of ten cases or twenty percent of its patients in the distributions for the 1985 period as determined pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, or if the facility had undergone the appointment of a receiver or the establishment of a new operator subsequent to the 1985 period but prior to January 1, 1988 and had filed a new cost report in accordance with the provisions of section\n86-2.10\n(k) of this Subpart which was used in the calculation of the payment rate, the facility's substituted 1985 period, as defined in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, shall be used in lieu of the 1985 period for the purposes of this subparagraph, and the only patients to be included shall be patients that were admitted to the facility in which they are presently residing before the end date of the facility's substituted 1985 period and have been identified by the department as also having been included in the patient assessments during the substituted 1985 period. (vi)\nA percentage increase in case mix attributable to LOS shall, for each facility, be determined as follows: (a) A 1985 aggregate case mix index shall be determined by multiplying the facility's 1985 distribution of patients, or a substituted 1985 distribution of patients where applicable, within each LOS group, determined pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph by the statewide average initial case mix index for each LOS group for the 1985 period, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, and dividing the sum of the results by the facility's total number of patients in all LOS groups, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. (b) A 1988 LOS adjusted case mix index shall be determined by multiplying the facility's 1988 distribution of patients within each LOS group determined pursuant to subparagraph (v) of this paragraph by the statewide average initial case mix index for each LOS group for the 1985 period, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, and dividing the sum of the results by the facility's total number of patients in all LOS groups, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (v) of this paragraph. (c) The 1985 aggregate case mix index shall be subtracted from the 1988 LOS adjusted case mix index and the result divided by the 1985 aggregate case mix index to arrive at the percentage increase in case mix attributable to LOS. (vii)\n\nAn actual percentage increase in case mix shall, for each facility, be determined as follows: (a) A 1985 actual case mix index shall be determined by multiplying the facility's 1985 distribution of patients, or a substituted 1985 distribution of patients where applicable, in each patient classification group, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, by the case mix index for each patient classification group as contained in Appendix 13-A herein and dividing the sum of the results by the facility's total number of patients in all patient classification groups, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. (b) A 1988 actual case mix index shall be determined by multiplying the facility's 1988 distribution of patients in each patient classification group, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, by the case mix index for each patient classification group as contained in Appendix 13-A herein and dividing the sum of the results by the facility's total number of patients in all patient classification groups, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (v) of this paragraph. (c) The 1985 actual case mix index shall be subtracted from the 1988 actual case mix index and the result divided by the 1985 actual case mix index to arrive at an actual percentage increase in case mix. (viii)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph, a percentage recalibration adjustment shall be determined by annualizing the result obtained by subtracting the percentage increase in case mix attributable to LOS determined pursuant to subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph from the actual percentage increase in case mix determined pursuant to subparagraph (vii) of this paragraph. (ix)\n\nIf a facility had undergone the appointment of a receiver or the establishment of a new operator on or after January 1, 1988 but prior to January 1, 1992, and filed a new cost report in accordance with the provisions of section\n86-2.10\n(k) of this Subpart which was used in the calculation of a revised payment rate, or for new facilities who received an initial operating certificate on or after January 1, 1988 but prior to January 1, 1992, the percentage recalibration adjustment provided for in this subdivision shall be 0 percent for such revised rate or such new facilities. (3)\n\nThe operating portion of each residential health care facility's rate of payment, as defined pursuant to section\n86-2.10\n(a)(7)\nof this Subpart, shall be reduced by a per diem recalibration adjustment which shall be determined as follows: (i) The percentage recalibration adjustment identified in subparagraph (2)(viii) of this subdivision shall be applied to the direct component of the rate determined in accordance with sections 86-2.10 and\n86-2.11\nof this Subpart, to arrive at each facility's per diem recalibration adjustment in 1983 base year dollars. (ii)\n\nEach facility's per diem recalibration adjustment in 1983 base year dollars shall then be trended to the rate year by the applicable roll factor as defined in section\n86-2.10\n(a)(8)\nof this Subpart. (b) For rate years 1992 and thereafter, notwithstanding any other provision of this Subpart and subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subdivision and subdivision (c) of this section, payment rates shall be adjusted in accordance with this subdivision to reflect a percentage recalibration adjustment based on the change in each facility's case mix which has been determined by the department to be due to factors other than changes in patient population or condition. Such payment rate adjustments shall be implemented utilizing the direct component of facility rates for such rate years determined in accordance with sections 86-2.10 and\n86-2.11\nof this Subpart. (1)\n\nThe percentage recalibration adjustment provided for in this subdivision shall not be less than 0 percent nor greater than 150 percent of the statewide weighted average percentage recalibration adjustment obtained by utilizing the facility-specific percentage recalibration adjustments as determined pursuant to this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe percentage recalibration adjustment shall be calculated as follows for each facility: (i) A statewide distribution of patients in each patient classification group shall be determined by utilizing the patient data for the assessment of all patients obtained in the patient assessment period March 1, 1985 through September 30, 1985 (the 1985 period) conducted pursuant to section\n86-2.30\nof this Subpart. (ii)\n\nThe statewide distribution of patients in each patient classification group shall be further segregated by the following length of stay (LOS) groups: (a) less than or equal to 90 days; (b) greater than 90 days but less than or equal to one year; (c) greater than one year but less than or equal to two years; (d) greater than two years but less than or equal to three years; (e) greater than three years but less than or equal to four years; (f) greater than four years but less than or equal to five years; or\n(g) greater than five years; (iii)\nA statewide average initial case mix index for each LOS group for the 1985 period shall be calculated by multiplying the initial distribution of patients in each patient classification group within each LOS group times the case mix index for each patient classification group as contained in Appendix 13-A herein and dividing the sum of the results by the total number of patients in all patient classification groups within each LOS group. (iv)\n\nFor each facility, a 1985 distribution of patients in each patient classification group and a 1985 distribution of patients by the LOS groups specified in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph shall be determined by utilizing the patient data for the assessment of all patients obtained in the 1985 period, conducted pursuant to section\n86-2.30\nof this Subpart. In the event a facility commenced operations after the patient assessment period, March 1, 1985 through September 30, 1985 (the 1985 period) but prior to January 1, 1988, or if the facility has the lesser of ten cases or twenty percent of its patients in the distributions as determined in this subparagraph for the 1985 period, or if the facility had undergone the appointment of a receiver or the establishment of a new operator subsequent to the 1985 period but prior to January 1, 1988 and had filed a new cost report in accordance with the provisions of section\n86-2.10\n(k) of this Subpart which was used in the calculation of the payment rate, the distribution of patients to be used for the purposes of this subparagraph shall be that distribution pertaining to the earliest full patient assessment period conducted pursuant to section\n86-2.30\nof this Subpart subsequent to the 1985 period or subsequent to the effective date of the appointment of a receiver or the change in operator (the \"substituted 1985 period\"), and such distribution shall be deemed the facility's \"substituted 1985 distribution\" of patients for the calculations in subparagraphs (vi) and (vii) of this paragraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, the only patients to be included in the distributions shall be patients that have been identified by the department as also having been included in the patient assessment period July 1, 1988 through December 31, 1988. (v) For each facility, a 1988 distribution of patients in each patient classification group and a 1988 distribution of patients by the LOS groups specified in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph shall be determined by utilizing the patient data obtained in the patient assessment period July 1, 1988 through December 31, 1988. For purposes of this subparagraph, the only patients to be included in the distributions shall be patients that were admitted to the facility in which they are presently residing before October 1, 1985 and have been identified by the department as also having been included in the patient assessments during the 1985 period.

(viii)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph, a percentage recalibration adjustment shall be determined by annualizing the result obtained by subtracting the percentage increase in case mix attributable to LOS determined pursuant to subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph from the actual percentage increase in case mix determined pursuant to subparagraph (vii) of this paragraph. (ix)\n\nIf a facility undergoes the appointment of a receiver or the establishment of a new operator on or after January 1, 1992 and files a new cost report in accordance with the provisions of section\n86-2.10\n(k) of this Subpart which is used in the calculation of a revised payment rate, or for new facilities who receive an initial operating certificate on or after January 1, 1992, the percentage recalibration adjustment provided for in this subdivision shall be 0 percent for such revised payment rate or for such new facilities. (3)\n\nThe operating portion of each residential health care facility's rate of payment, as defined pursuant to section\n86-2.10\n(a)(7)\nof this Subpart, shall be reduced by a per diem recalibration adjustment which shall be determined as follows: (i) The percentage recalibration adjustment identified in subparagraph (2)(viii) of this subdivision shall be applied to the direct component of the rate determined in accordance with sections 86-2.10 and\n86-2.11\nof this Subpart, to arrive at each facility's per diem recalibration adjustment in 1983 base year dollars. (ii)\n\nEach facility's per diem recalibration adjustment in 1983 base year dollars shall then be trended to the rate year by the applicable roll factor as defined in section\n86-2.10\n(a)(8)\nof this Subpart. (c) For a residential health care facility receiving a percentage recalibration adjustment greater than 0 percent, as determined in subdivision (b) of this section, the percentage recalibration adjustment may be modified as provided in this subdivision. (1)\n\nIn order to be eligible for a modification, a facility shall meet all of the following conditions. (i) A modification request shall be submitted by a facility as an appeal application and shall be submitted within the time limit set forth in section\n86-2.13\n(a) of this Subpart. (ii)\nA facility shall document that the percentage change in the facility's reported case mix index (CMI) from the annual rate period 1985 through 1988, such percentage reduced by the percentage recalibration adjustment as determined by subdivision (b) of this section, is at least 10 percent. The percentage change in the facility's reported CMI, for purposes of this subparagraph, shall utilize the CMI calculated from the facility's patient data obtained during the patient assessment period, March 1, 1985 through September 30, 1985, to the patient assessment period July 1, 1988 through December 31, 1988, conducted pursuant to section\n86-2.30\nof this Subpart, and shall be calculated by subtracting from the reported 1988 CMI, the reported 1985 CMI and the result divided by the reported 1985 CMI. (iii)\n(iii)\n(a) Except as provided in clause (b) of this subparagraph, a facility shall document that the percentage change in direct care cost over trend from the annual rate period 1985 through 1988, as defined by those cost centers listed in section\n86-2.10\n(c) of this Subpart, is at least 10 percent. The percentage change in direct care cost over trend for purposes of this subparagraph shall be calculated by subtracting from the 1988 annual reported direct care cost, the 1985 annual reported direct care cost trended to 1988 by the applicable trend factors promulgated by the department for 1986, 1987 and 1988, and the result divided by the trended 1985 direct care cost. The annual reported direct care costs for 1985 and 1988, for purposes of this subparagraph, shall be those which the facility has submitted using the result of the single step-down method of cost allocation as defined in section\n451.29\nof this Title. (b) In the event a facility's facility-specific cost based direct price per day exceeds the facility-specific ceiling direct price per day, as determined pursuant to section\n86-2.10\n(c)(4)\nof this Subpart, for the annual rate period 1988, such excess percentage shall be used to determine a credit to be added to the facility's percentage change in direct care cost over trend as determined in clause (a) of this subparagraph for the purposes of meeting the required percentage change in direct care cost over trend identified in clause (a) of this subparagraph. The amount of the credit shall be equal to such excess percentage if the facility documents that its percentage change in indirect care cost over trend from the annual rate period 1985 through 1988, as defined by those cost centers listed in section\n86-2.10\n(d) of this Subpart, does not exceed its percentage change in direct care cost over trend for this period, as determined in clause (a) of this subparagraph, and if the facility cannot so document, the credit identified in this clause shall be reduced (but not be less than 0 percent) by the extent to which the percentage change in indirect care cost over trend exceeds the percentage change in direct care cost over trend. The percentage change in indirect care cost over trend for purposes of this subparagraph shall be calculated by subtracting from the 1988 annual reported indirect care cost, the 1985 annual reported indirect care cost trended to 1988 by the applicable trend factors promulgated by the department for 1986, 1987 and 1988, and the result divided by the trended 1985 indirect care cost. The annual reported indirect care costs for 1985 and 1988, for purposes of this subparagraph, shall be those which the facility has submitted using the result of the single stepdown method of cost allocation as defined in section\n451.29\nof this Title. (iv)\n\nDocumentation shall be included in an appeal filed by the facility to the department that supports the reasons for the direct care cost increase which shall be based on increases in staffing levels and/or range and/or types of patient services. Increased direct care cost resulting solely from an increase in the bed complement of a facility shall not constitute sufficient justification for granting a modification pursuant to this subdivision. (2)\n\nFor a facility meeting all conditions specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the modified percentage recalibration adjustment shall be determined as follows. (i) The modification to the percentage recalibration adjustment shall be determined by annualizing the result obtained by subtracting the percentage change in the facility's reported CMI reduced by the percentage recalibration adjustment, as determined in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision, from the percentage change in direct care cost over trend, as determined in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nThe modified percentage recalibration adjustment shall be equal to the result obtained by subtracting the modification to the percentage recalibration adjustment, as determined in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, from the percentage recalibration adjustment identified in subparagraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section. (iii)\n\nThe modified percentage recalibration adjustment, as determined in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, shall not be less than 0 percent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
