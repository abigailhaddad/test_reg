Tit. 15 § 82.6 - Civil penalty and restitution\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The commissioner, or any person deputized\nby him, in addition to or in lieu of revoking or suspending the certificate of\nregistration of a registrant in accordance with the provisions of the act or\nthis Part, or upon finding that a registrant has been grossly negligent in the\nperformance of any repair or adjustment covered by the act or this Part, or has\ngrossly overcharged for such repair or adjustment, may in any one proceeding by\norder require the registrant to pay to the People of this State a penalty for a\nfirst violation in a sum not exceeding $750 for each violation found to have\nbeen committed, and for a second or subsequent violation not arising out of the\nsame incident both of which were committed within a period of 30 months, be a\ncivil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each violation found to have been\ncommitted; provided, however, the penalty for each and any violation of\nparagraph (g) of subdivision one of section\n398-e\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law found to have been committed shall be no less\nthan $350 and no more than $1,000, except that if a finding of financial loss\nis made pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, the amount of such penalty\nmay be increased by the amount of financial loss so found. Upon the failure of\nsuch registrant to pay such penalty within 30 days after the mailing of such\norder, postage prepaid, registered, and addressed to the last known place of\nbusiness of such registrant, the commissioner may revoke the certificate of\nregistration of such registrant or may suspend the same for such period as he\nmay determine without further proceedings. (b) Upon a determination that a registrant\nhas done or failed to do any act for which suspension of the registrant's\nregistration or a civil penalty against the registrant could be imposed, the\nperson making such determination may make a finding of financial loss to any\ncomplainant or complainants resulting from the actions of the registrant. The\nperson making such finding may provide that if the registrant makes restitution\nto the complainant or complainants for the amount or amounts so found, the\npayment of such restitution may be substituted in lieu of any suspension or\ncivil penalty, or a specified portion thereof imposed upon the registrant. However, a finding of financial loss shall only be made if the complainant: (1)\nagrees to accept the amount so found, if\noffered by the registrant; and\n(2)\nis not a party to any litigation which is pending or which has gone to judgment\nin relation to the same matter in any civil court. (c) The amount of financial loss which may be\nfound and proposed as restitution shall be limited to an amount necessary to\nrepair the vehicle or vehicles in question and/or any amount of overcharge\nwhich may be found. Neither punitive nor incidental damages may be included in\nthe finding of financial loss. (d) If payment of restitution to the complainant is authorized in lieu of all or a\nportion of a suspension or civil penalty, in order for the registrant to\nexercise the option to make such payment, such payment must be made by means of\na certified check or money order payable to the complainant or complainants\ndelivered to an office of the department as directed by the commissioner or his\nagent within 30 days of the date of notice of suspension and/or civil penalty. Upon receipt of such certified check or money order, the department shall\nforward the same to the complainant or complainants. (e) If payment of restitution may be\nsubstituted in lieu of a civil penalty or portion of a civil penalty, and the\nregistrant does not exercise the option to make such payment, the civil penalty\nbecomes due as provided in subdivision (a) of this section. (f) Any payment made in compliance with such\na finding of financial loss shall not preclude any civil action which may be\nbrought by either the complainant or registrant, and any such finding may be\nconsidered but shall not be binding upon any court before which any such action\nis brought.
