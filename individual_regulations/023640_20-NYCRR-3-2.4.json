  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-2.4 - Average value\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210(2))\n(a) In determining average value, the\ntaxpayer must use fair market value (FMV) for real property and marketable\nsecurities and must use the value shown on the balance sheet included with its\n\nFederal tax return for personal property other than marketable securities. If\nthe taxpayer is not required to include a balance sheet in its Federal income\ntax return, it must use the value for personal property other than marketable\nsecurities that it would have used if it had been required to include a balance\nsheet with its Federal income tax return. In the case of an alien corporation\nthat under any provision of the IRC is not treated as a \"domestic corporation\"\nas defined in IRC section 7201, only amounts that are effectively connected\nwith the United States trade or business are included. However, corporations\nmore than 50% directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the taxpayer (or\ncombined group) must be valued using the equity method of accounting in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), provided the\nvalue cannot be less than zero. The equity method of accounting calls for each\nsuch corporation to be valued based on the average value of its owner's equity\naccount per its balance sheet. Allowance must be made for variations in the\namount of assets held by the taxpayer during the period covered by the report, as well as for variations in market prices. Average value generally is computed\non a quarterly basis where the taxpayer's usual accounting practice permits\nsuch computation. However, at the option of the taxpayer, a more frequent basis\n(such as a monthly, weekly or daily average) may be used. Where the taxpayer's\nusual accounting practice does not permit a quarterly or more frequent\ncomputation of average value, a semiannual or annual computation may be used\nwhere no distortion of average value will result. If, because of variations in\nthe amount or value of any class of assets, it appears to the commissioner that\naveraging on an annual, semiannual or quarterly basis does not properly reflect\naverage value, the commissioner may require averaging on a more frequent basis. Any method of determining average value that is adopted by the taxpayer on any\nreport and accepted by the commissioner may not be changed on any subsequent\nreport without the prior consent of The commissioner. (b) Generally, the value of assets must be\ndetermined without reduction for liabilities. However, if a taxpayer's assets\ninclude reverse repurchase agreements and/or securities borrowing agreements, then the sum of the FMV of these assets must be reduced, but not below zero, by\nthe sum of the FMV of all repurchase agreements and/or securities lending\nagreements included in the taxpayer's liabilities. (1)\n\nExamples. Example 1: A taxpayer owns shares of common stock of X\nCorporation. The FMVs, during the period covered by its report, on a quarterly\nbasis, were as follows: (1)\nat the end\nof first quarter, it owned no shares; (2)\nat the end of second quarter, it owned no\nshares; (3)\nat the end of third\nquarter, it owned no shares; and\n(4)\nat the end of fourth quarter, it owned\n100 shares with a value of $100 a share. The average value during the period covered by the\nreport, on a quarterly basis, of the taxpayer's holdings of X Corporation's\ncommon stock would be $2,500, computed as follows: Fair market values of stock\n\nEnd of 1st quarter\n0\n\nEnd of 2nd quarter\n0\n\nEnd of 3rd quarter\n0\n\nEnd of 4th quarter\n$10,000\n\nTotal\n$10,000\n\nAverage Value: 10,000 ÷ 4 = $2,500\n\nExample 2: The taxpayer's inventories and their values\nduring the period covered by its report, on a quarterly basis, were as\nfollows: (1)\nat the end of\nfirst quarter, 1,000 tons with a value of $2 a ton; (2)\nat the end of second quarter, 2,000 tons\nwith a value of $2 a ton; (3)\nat\nthe end of third quarter, 2,000 tons with a value of $3 a ton; and\n(4)\nat the end of fourth quarter, 1,000 tons\nwith a value of $2 a ton. The average value of the taxpayer's inventories during\nthe period covered by the report, computed on a quarterly basis, would be\n$3,500, computed as follows: Value of inventories\n\nEnd of 1st quarter\n$2,000\n\nEnd of 2nd quarter\n$4,000\n\nEnd of 3rd quarter\n$6,000\n\nEnd of 4th quarter\n$2,000\n\nTotal\n$14,000\n\nAverage Value: 14,000 ÷ 4 = $3,500\n\nExample 3: The taxpayer did not dispose of or acquire any\npart of its plant or equipment during the period covered by its report. The\nvalues of its plant and equipment were as follows: (1)\nat the beginning of the year, the value\nwas $800,000; and\n(2)\nat the end of\nthe year, the value was $780,000. The average value of the taxpayer's plant and equipment\nduring the period covered by its report, computed on the basis of the average\nvalues at the beginning end and end of such period, would be $790,000, computed\nas follows: Beginning of year\n$800,000\n\nEnd of year\n$780,000\n\nTotal\n$1,580,000\n\nAverage Value: = 1,580,000 ÷ 2 =\n$790,000\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
