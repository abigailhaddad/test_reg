The program\nstaff may request and shall, notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, be\nentitled to receive from any physician, mental hygiene facility, health care\nfacility or person licensed to render health care, any information which is\nrelevant to the patient's need for surrogate decision-making or the proposed\ndecision.

Any such person's objection\nshall be made part of the record. (8)\n\nWhen the proposed major medical treatment\ndecision consists of more than one medical, surgical or diagnostic intervention\nor procedure, the panel shall be empowered to consider and give or refuse\nconsent for each proposed intervention or procedure separately.

(9)\n\nWhen the proposed end-of-life decision\nconsists of more than one medical, surgical or diagnostic intervention or\nprocedure, the panel shall be empowered to consider and give or refuse consent\nfor each proposed intervention or procedure separately. If the panel gives\nconsent for one or more, but not all, of the proposed interventions or\nprocedures, the panel's record of its determination shall indicate consent or\nrefusal for each intervention or procedure separately. (10)\n\nWhere practicable, the panel shall reach\nits determination immediately and provide a copy of the determination to the\ninterested parties immediately after the hearing.

(12)\n\nNothing in\nthis section shall be interpreted to authorize ex parte communications during\nthe hearing or consideration of materials, information, or opinions not\npresented formally at the hearing. (c) The panel's determination of the\npatient's need for surrogate decision-making shall be made in accordance with\nthe following provisions: (1)\n\nIn hearings\nregarding proposed major medical treatment decisions, the panel shall determine\nwhether there is clear and convincing evidence that the patient: lacks the\ncapacity to make the proposed major medical treatment decision; and does not\nhave a parent, spouse, adult child, other authorized surrogate, or legal\nguardian, who is legally authorized, available and willing to make such a\ndecision. Clear and convincing evidence is evidence that is highly reliable and\nupon which reasonable persons may rely with confidence in the probability of\nits correctness. (2)\n\nIn determining\nwhether the patient lacks the capacity to make the proposed major medical\ntreatment decision, the panel shall consider whether the patient is unable to\nadequately understand and appreciate the nature and consequences of the\nproposed major medical treatment decision, including: (i) the burdens of the treatment to the\npatient in terms of pain and suffering outweighing the benefits, or whether the\nproposed treatment would merely prolong the patient's suffering and not provide\nany net benefit; (ii)\nthe degree, expected duration and constancy of pain with and without treatment, and the\npossibility that the pain could be mitigated by less intrusive forms of medical\ntreatment including the administration of medications; (iii)\nthe likely prognosis, expectant level\nof functioning, degree of humiliation, and dependency with or without the\nproposed major medical treatment; and\n(iv)\nthe evaluation of treatment options, including non-treatment, and their benefits and risks compared to those of the\nproposed major medical treatment decision. (3)\n\nIn hearings regarding the proposed\nwithholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, the panel shall\ndetermine whether there is clear and convincing evidence as defined in (c)(1)\nof this section that the patient is in need of surrogate decision-making by\nconsidering the certification by the attending physician and the consulting\nphysician or licensed psychologist as set forth in Part 710.4(c)(2) and\nconsidering each of the factors set forth in the declaration. (4)\n\nUnless three panel members concur in the\ndetermination that the patient is in need of surrogate decision-making, the\npatient shall be deemed not to need surrogate decision-making. (5)\n\nIn the event that the patient is deemed\nnot to need surrogate decision-making because they have the capacity to consent\non their own behalf, patient consent to or refusal of such treatment, if given, shall constitute legally valid consent or refusal therefor. No other consent\nshall be required by a provider of health services. (d) The panel's determination regarding the\nappropriateness of the proposed health care decision shall be made in\naccordance with the following provisions: (1)\n\nIn a hearing regarding proposed major medical treatment, if a patient has been\ndetermined by the panel to be in need of surrogate decision-making, the panel\nshall make a determination whether the proposed major medical treatment is in\nthe best interests of the patient based upon a fair preponderance of the\nevidence. A fair preponderance of the evidence is evidence that an issue is\nmore likely true than not. (2)\n\nIn a\nhearing regarding the proposed withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining\ntreatment, if a patient has been determined by the panel to be in need of\nsurrogate decision-making, the panel shall make a determination whether the\nproposed end-of-life decision is in the best interests of the patient based\nupon a fair preponderance of the evidence as defined in (d)(1) of this section. Decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment pursuant to section\n1750-b of the SCPA shall include consideration of the following additional\nfactors: (i) the panel decision is not\nintended to permit suicide, assisted suicide or euthanasia; (ii)\nthe panel decision shall be based on the\npatient's qualifying medical condition, other than developmental disability, with recognition that a person with developmental disability is entitled to\nfull and equal rights, equal protection, respect, medical care and dignity\nafforded to persons without developmental disabilities and without any\nfinancial considerations as such may affect the health care provider or any\nother party. (3)\n\nAny\nevidence of an articulated preference by the patient concerning the proposed\ntreatment shall be given full consideration by the panel. (4)\n\nThe panel's consent to major medical\ntreatment shall state that any tissues or parts surgically removed may be\ndisposed of or preserved by the provider of health services in accordance with\ncustomary practice. (e) Effect of the panel determination\n(1)\n\nThe\npanel determination shall include the effective date and the expiration date. The panel may delay the effective date for up to five days in order to enable\nan objecting party to exercise the right of appeal. For all determinations\nregarding a decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment, the\npanel shall not delay the effective date of its decision. (2)\nA copy of any panel determination shall\ncontain a statement describing the right to appeal and shall promptly be sent\nto the following parties: patient; other persons requested by the patient to\nappear on their behalf; declarant; patient's parent, spouse, adult child, legal\nguardian, other known authorized surrogates, and correspondents; the director\nof the patient's residential facility or designee; service coordination\nprovider; and MHLS. (3)\n\nIn the event\nthat a panel refuses to consent to a major medical treatment that may be\nconsidered life-sustaining, any party may submit a new declaration for\nconsideration as a declaration for the withholding or withdrawal of\nlife-sustaining treatment with the requisite certifications and supporting\ndocuments. (4)\n\nIn the event that a\npanel refuses to consent to the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining\ntreatment, any party may submit a new declaration for consideration as a\ndeclaration for surrogate decision-making for major medical treatment, with the\nrequisite supporting documents. (5)\n\nThe panel determination regarding the major medical treatment decision or the\nend-of-life decision shall constitute legally valid consent or refusal to such\ntreatment in the same manner and to the same extent as if the patient were able\nto consent or refuse on their own behalf. No other consent shall be required by\na provider of health services. (6)\nA panel determination that a patient is in need of surrogate decision-making\nfor the proposed major medical treatment decision shall not be valid for any\nfuture major medical treatment and shall not be construed or deemed valid for\nany other purpose or for any other future major medical treatment unless the\ndetermination applies to related or continuing treatment necessitated by the\noriginal treatment. No panel determination shall be valid after the expiration\ndate listed in the determination, except as provided for in section\n701.5\n(b)(4)(iii). (7)\nA panel determination that a patient is\nin need of surrogate decision-making shall not be construed or deemed to be a\ndetermination that such patient is impaired or incompetent or incapacitated\npursuant to article 81 of the MHL. (8)\n\nNo person shall be deemed to have failed\nto exhaust administrative remedies for commencing a legal action to obtain a\nmajor medical treatment decision because of the pending review of the case by a\npanel. (f) A record of the\ndeterminations and proceedings of the panel shall be made and retained for 10\nyears.
