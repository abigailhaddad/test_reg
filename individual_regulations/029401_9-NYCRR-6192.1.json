(b) The\nterm\nCODIS\nrefers to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's\n\nCombined DNA Index System. (c) The\nterm\ncommission\nrefers to the Commission on Forensic Science\nestablished pursuant to Executive Law section 995-a. (d) The term\ncommissioner\nrefers to the commissioner of the New York State Division of Criminal Justice\n\nServices, or his or her designee. (e) The phrase\nconvicted offender DNA\nprofile\nrefers to a DNA profile generated by analysis of a biological\nsample collected from a designated offender as defined in Executive Law section\n995(7). (f) The term\ndivision\nrefers to the NYS Division of Criminal Justice\n\nServices. (g) The term\nDNA\nmeans deoxyribonucleic acid. (h) The phrase\nDNA databank\nrefers to the computerized State DNA Identification Index authorized pursuant\nto Executive Law section 995-c, and known as the State DNA Index System\n(SDIS). (i) The phrase\nDNA\nprofile\nrefers to a set of DNA identification characteristics which\nmay permit the DNA of one person to be distinguished from that of another\nperson. For STR DNA profiles it refers to the list of alleles carried by a\nparticular individual at a specific set of genetic loci. (j) The phrase\nDNA profile of a\nmissing person\nrefers to the results of a forensic analysis of the DNA\nof a person reported missing or whose whereabouts are unknown. (k) The term\nDNA\nsubcommittee\nrefers to the subcommittee on forensic DNA laboratories\nand forensic DNA testing established pursuant to Executive Law section\n995-b(13). (l) The term\nFBI\nrefers to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (m) The phrase\nforensic DNA\nlaboratory\nshall have the same meaning as set forth in Executive Law\nsection 995(2). (n) The term\nforensic DNA testing\nshall have the same meaning as set forth\nin Executive Law section 995(2). (o) The phrase\nforensic\nindex\nrefers to the electronic database in CODIS containing DNA\nprofiles generated from crime scene evidence by forensic DNA\nlaboratories. (p) The phrase\nforensic DNA profile\nrefers to a DNA profile that is derived\nfrom biological evidence originating from and associated with the commission of\na crime. The phrases\ncasework evidence DNA profile\nand\ncrime scene DNA profile\nshall have the same\ndefinition. (q) The phrases\nindirect association and partial match refer to the determination during the\nCODIS candidate match confirmation process that a forensic DNA profile is\nsimilar to a DNA profile in the offender index and a comparison reveals that\nthe offender may be a close biological relative of the source of the forensic\nindex profile. The phrases may be used interchangeably. (r) The term\nLDIS\nrefers to\nthat level of the CODIS program in which a public DNA laboratory maintains its\nDNA records for searching and uploading to higher level indices such as SDIS\nand NDIS. (s) The term\nloci\nrefers to specific chromosomal locations of genes or\nother DNA elements such as STRs. (t) The term\nmitochondrial DNA\ntesting\nor\nmtDNA testing\nrefers to analysis of\ngenetic polymorphisms that occur in the DNA of mitochondria. (u) The term\nNDIS\nrefers to\nthe National DNA Index System. (v) The phrase\nNDIS Operating Procedures\nrefers to the document\nspecifying the requirements for DNA data to be accepted for searching and\nstorage in CODIS. It was issued by the FBI, Laboratory Division, 2501\n\nInvestigation Parkway, Quantico, VA 22135. This document may be reviewed at\nhttps://www.fbi.gov. (w) The term\noffender index\nrefers to the electronic database in CODIS\ncontaining both convicted offender and subject DNA profiles. (x) The term\nSTR\nrefers to\n\nShort Tandem Repeat.

(y) The phrase\nsubject DNA\nprofile\nrefers to a DNA profile generated by analysis of a biological\nsample collected from a subject convicted of a crime whose specimen was\ncollected: pursuant to a plea agreement; as a condition for participation in a\ntemporary release, Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (CASAT), or shock incarceration program; as a condition of release on parole, post-release supervision, presumptive release, or conditional release on a\ndefinite or indeterminate sentence; or as a condition of probation or interim\nprobation supervision. (z) The\nphrase\nunidentified human DNA profile\nrefers to a DNA profile\ndeveloped from recovered deceased remains or from an individual who cannot or\nwill not identify themselves. (aa)\n\nThe phrase\nunidentified human (remains) index\nrefers to the\nelectronic database in CODIS containing DNA profiles developed from recovered\ndeceased remains or from an individual who cannot or will not identify\nthemselves. (ab)\n\nThe phrases\nfamilial DNA search and familial search refer to a targeted evaluation of\noffenders' DNA profiles in the DNA databank which generates a list of candidate\nprofiles based on kinship indices to indicate potential biologically related\nindividuals to one or more sources of evidence. (ac)\n\nThe phrase offender refers to anyone in\nthe Databank who has been convicted of a crime. (ad)\n\nThe phrases State CODIS administrator\nand State System administrator refer to an employee of the state CODIS\nlaboratory who is responsible for administration and security of the\ndatabank.
