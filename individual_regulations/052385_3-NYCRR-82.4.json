Tit. 3 § 82.4 - Negative amortization (deferral and capitalization)\n\nState Regulations\n\nDuring the term of the loan the loan-to-value ratio may\nincrease above the initial loan-to-value ratio if the increase results from a\nchange authorized under sections 82.3 and\n82.2\n(b) of this\n\nPart, but the loan balance may not exceed 125 percent of the original appraised\nvalue of the property unless the loan contract provides that the payment shall\nbe adjusted at least once every five years, beginning no later than the tenth\nyear of the loan, to a level sufficient to amortize the loan at the then\nexisting interest rate and loan balance over the remaining term of the\nloan. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n82.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
