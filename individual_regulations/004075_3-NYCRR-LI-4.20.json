  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.20 - Interest rates on time deposits in savings banks and savings and loan associations\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked to review two situations wherein\nthrift institutions have been offering different interest rates on time deposit\naccounts of the same maturities. In the first situation, a thrift institution\nwith its principal office in City A and a branch in City B is offering a higher\nrate at the branch in City B than at its office in City A. In the second\nsituation, a thrift institution offers to renew maturing time deposits at a\nhigher rate than it offers for new deposits of the same maturity. Time deposits at thrifts are governed by contract between the\nbanking organization and its customer, as authorized by Banking Law, sections\n234.1 -a and 378-a. S o long as the interest offered is within the limits set\nby law, the rate of interest may be established by competitive market forces\nand by agreement between the parties. It is the Banking Department's opinion\nthat there is no impediment in the Banking Law or in the department's\nregulations to the payment of interest as proposed above. The department has been informed by the Federal Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation that, in its opinion, interest rate differentials such as\nthose described above are not prohibited by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\nor by its implementing regulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 4.20\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
