  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 50-2.3 - Times, places for inspecting records and means for verifying the identity of a data subject\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Records shall be available for inspection and copying by data subjects/authorized representatives on every day that the offices of the department are open for the transaction of business between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:45 p.m. (b) Records may be inspected at locations designated by the appropriate records access officer, whose titles and business addresses are as set forth in section\n50-1.4\nof this Part. (c) The identity of a data subject who requests access to his/her record may require verification as follows: (1)\n\nPrior to being given access to personal information, an individual may be required to provide reasonable verification of his/her identity. No verification of identity, however, shall be required of an individual seeking access to records which are otherwise available to any member of the public under the Freedom of Information Law. (2)\n\nIn the case of an individual who seeks access or amendment in person, verification of identity will normally be made from those documents that an individual is likely to have readily available, such as an employee identification card, driver license, etc. (3)\n\nWhen access or amendment is requested by mail, verification of identity may be obtained by requiring the individual to provide certain minimum identifying data, such as date of birth and some item of information in the record that only the concerned individual would likely know. If the sensitivity of the information in the record warrants, a signed and notarized statement of identity may be required. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n50-2.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
