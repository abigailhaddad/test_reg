  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 633.14 - Procedures for the control of tuberculosis\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. This section applies to developmental centers and facilities\ncertified by OPWDD, including family care. It does not apply to service\nrecipients of Clinic Treatment Facilities as defined in Part 679 of this\ntitle. (b) Definitions. The following definitions are applicable to this section\nonly. (1)\nAFB smears and\ncultures. Laboratory tests used to determine the presence or absence\nof an active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. They are used to help\ndetermine whether tuberculosis (TB) is confined to the lungs (pulmonary) or has\nspread to organs outside the lungs (extrapulmonary). (2)\n\nActive pulmonary\ntuberculosis. A contagious disease of the lungs that is confirmed by\nculture to be caused by the microorganism Mycobacterium tuberculosis. (3)\n\nEmployee. Someone who\nhas an employee-employer full, part-time or seasonal relationship with a\nservice provider, and who receives monetary or other compensation in exchange\nfor his/her performance of assigned duties. (4)\n\nContractor. A party\nsubject to a contractual arrangement with OPWDD or a service provider, to\nperform a service in exchange for financial or other consideration and who will\nbe reasonably anticipated to have direct contact with service recipients. This\nincludes independent contractors and parties who are employed by\ncontractors. (5)\n\nPossible\ntuberculosis infection. Someone demonstrating a significant reaction\nto a TB test, but who has no signs or symptoms of active pulmonary tuberculosis\nand no tuberculosis organisms are found in the sputum. (6)\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). The bacterium that causes most cases of\ntuberculosis. (7)\n\nPurified\nprotein derivative (PPD). A purified protein derivative of the\ntubercle bacilli, used in the tuberculin skin test (see tuberculin skin\ntest). (8)\n\nService\nprovider. A developmental center or operator of a facility certified\nby OPWDD, other than Clinic Treatment Facilities described in Part 679 of this\ntitle. In the case of a family care home, the sponsoring agency shall be\nresponsible for complying with requirements applicable to the service\nprovider. (9)\n\nService\nrecipient. Any person receiving services from a develop- mental center\nor facility certified by OPWDD, except for those receiving services through a\n\nClinic Treatment Facility described in Part 679 of this title. (10)\n\nSuspected active pulmonary\ntuberculosis. A condition in which a person either exhibits the\nclinical signs and symptoms of active pulmonary tuberculosis or has a\nsignificant reaction to the TB test and is awaiting the results of diagnostic\ntesting. (11)\nTB\ntesting. Screening for tuberculosis infection utilizing a test\ncurrently approved by the United State Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nand/or recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for that\npurpose. (12)\n\nTuberculin\nskin test (TST). A test which involves the introduction of a purified\nprotein derivative (PPD) of the tubercle bacilli, called tuberculin, into the\nskin by intradermal injection and which is read in millimeters of induration\nwithin 48-72 hours. (13)\n\nTwo-step PPD. A procedure performed to rule out the presence\nof an anamnestic response in people who were infected with tuberculosis in the\ndistant past. An anamnestic phenomenon is one in which an initial negative TST\ntriggers an immune response, resulting in a subsequent positive TST. (14)\n\nVolunteer. A person who\nmeets the definition of \"volunteer\" in section\n633.99\nof this Part who has\nregular direct contact with persons receiving services. This does not include\nparticipants in groups that only periodically are in contact with persons\nreceiving services (\ne.g., groups who come in to sing holiday\nsongs). The provisions applying to volunteers in this section also apply to\nstudents, interns and senior companions. (c) Testing for TB. (1)\n\nInitial testing. (i) All employees, volunteers, contractors, family care providers and approved substitute/respite providers shall have TB\ntesting completed prior to their first day of employment or service provision. If using the two-step PPD, individuals may begin work if the first TST is\nnegative. (ii)\n\nAll service\nrecipients shall either provide proof of TB testing within the last 12 months\nor be assessed for signs and symptoms of active pulmonary tuberculosis on or\nprior to their first day of receipt of service. TB testing must be carried out\nwithin seven days of the first day of receipt of service.

(2)\n\nAnnual testing - developmental centers\nonly. (i) TB testing shall be conducted on an\nannual basis for employees, volunteers, contractors, and service recipients who\nprovide/receive services in a developmental center. (ii)\n\nAll service recipients, employees, volunteers, and contractors who provide/receive services in a developmental\ncenter shall receive annual TB testing within 12 months of their last\ndocumented test. An employee, contractor, volunteer or service recipient may\nselect testing by his/her own health care provider. The results of the TB\ntesting and any necessary follow-up evaluation must be documented and shared\nwith the service provider. (3)\n\nExposure testing. Testing shall be conducted for all service recipients, employees, contractors, volunteers, family care providers and approved respite/substitute providers who\nare exposed to someone with a suspected or confirmed case of active pulmonary\ntuberculosis. Such exposure testing will be conducted in cooperation with the\nstate and local health departments. (d) Exclusions/contraindications for TB\ntesting. (1)\n\nIn order for the service\nprovider to permit a party's exclusion from either\npre-employment/pre-receipt/pre-delivery of services or follow-up TST, the\nservice provider shall have documentation of one of the following reasons for\ncontraindication: (i) prior documented\nsignificant reaction to TB testing; or\n(ii)\nadequate treatment for active pulmonary\ntuberculosis; or\n(iii)\ncompletion\nof adequate preventive therapy. (2)\nA statement by a physician, nurse\npractitioner or physician's assistant of contraindication shall be acceptable\nas long as the statement includes: (i) a\nrecommendation as to when and if testing would be appropriate at a designated\npoint in the future; and\n(ii)\nhow\nthe party will be evaluated for active pulmonary tuberculosis in the\ninterim. (3)\n\nEvaluation\nof parties excluded from TB testing. A registered nurse shall conduct a general\nevaluation of the party taking into account any present symptomatology and\nhistory since the party's previous TB test or evaluation. Based on such\nevaluation the nurse may refer the party to a physician, nurse practitioner or\nphysician's assistant for a formal diagnostic evaluation to exclude active\npulmonary tuberculosis. Routine chest x-ray examinations are not\nrequired. (4)\n\nPrior vaccination\nwith Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) is not a contraindication for TB\ntesting. Results are interpreted in the same manner as for someone who has not\nbeen immunized. (5)\n\nEvaluation of a\nparty excluded from TST testing who has been exposed to someone with a\nsuspected or confirmed case of active pulmonary tuberculosis. Such party shall\nbe referred to the local health department for appropriate post-exposure\nevaluation. (e) Performance and interpretation of TB testing. (1)\nTB testing shall be performed in\naccordance with generally accepted community practice in the fields of medicine\nand nursing. (2)\n\nIf an initial TST\nis performed, it shall be conducted employing a two-step PPD unless the person\nhas documented evidence of a TST within the last 12 months. (3)\n\nIf a TST is performed, the reading of the\nTST shall be performed between 48 and 72 hours after implantation by one of the\nfollowing: physician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, registered\nnurse, or licensed practical nurse.

Documentation shall include the date\ntested, the testing method used, the results of the test and the interpretation\nof the test. If using the TST, documentation shall also include the testing\nmaterial used, the site of implantation, the date of reading and the size of\nthe reaction in induration (not erythema) in millimeters. (f) Evaluation of those with\nsignificant reaction. Any party with a significant reaction and/or a test result\ninterpreted to indicate possible tuberculosis infection shall be immediately\nreferred to a health care provider knowledgeable in the diagnosis of\ntuberculosis for a formal diagnostic evaluation to exclude active pulmonary\ntuberculosis. (1)\n\nThe following\nrequirements apply to employees, volunteers, contractors, family care providers\nand approved substitute/respite providers: (i) If initial testing shows a significant reaction and/or a test result\ninterpreted to indicate possible tuberculosis infection, the party shall not be\nallowed to begin employment/service provision until: (a) the party is evaluated by a health care\nprovider and found to be free of active pulmonary tuberculosis; or\n(b) the party meets the following criteria: (1)\nadequate treatment is instituted; and\n(2)\nthe cough is resolved; and\n(3)\nsputum specimens are\nnegative on three consecutive AFB smears. (ii)\n\nIf annual testing and/or exposure\ntesting shows a significant reaction and/or a test result interpreted to\nindicate possible tuberculosis infection, the party shall be assessed by a\nregistered nurse, physician, physician's assistant or nurse practitioner for\nsigns/symptoms of active pulmonary tuberculosis. (a) Employees, volunteers, and contractors\nwithout signs/symptoms of active pulmonary tuberculosis may continue to work\nbut must be evaluated within five days.
