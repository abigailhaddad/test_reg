  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 633.18 - Procedures governing do not resuscitate (DNR) orders (see glossary)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Principles of compliance. (1)\n\nThe regulations contained in this section apply to persons (see glossary) in\nfacilities operated or certified by OPWDD. (2)\n\nNothing in this section shall require\nfacilities to expand their existing personnel, training, or equipment to\nprovide cardiopulmonary resuscitation (see glossary). (3)\n\nGeneral requirements. (i) Anyone admitted to a facility shall be\npresumed to consent to the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in\nthe event of cardiac or respiratory arrest, unless there is consent to the\nissuance of an order not to resuscitate, hereinafter referred to as a DNR order\n(see glossary) as provided in this section. (ii)\n\nWhen a person who has a health care\nagent (see glossary) lacks capacity pursuant to section\n633.20\n(a)(9)\nof\nthis Part, the agent shall have the rights and authority that a person with\ncapacity would have pursuant to this section, subject to the terms of the\nhealth care proxy, section\n633.20\nof this Part, and article\n29-C of the New York State Public Health Law entitled \"Health Care Agents and\n\nProxies.\"\n(iii)\n\nIt is lawful for an\nattending physician (see glossary) to issue a DNR order provided that the order\nhas been issued pursuant to the requirements of this section and article 29-B\nof the New York State Public Health Law, entitled, \"Orders Not To Resuscitate\". The order is to be included in writing in the medical portion of a person's\nclinical record and include all the terms and conditions of the order. A DNR\norder is effective upon issuance. (iv)\n\nIssuance of orders. (a) A DNR order may be originally issued by: (1)\nan attending physician in a developmental\ncenter (see glossary) for a person located in the developmental\ncenter; (2)\nan attending physician\nin a hospital (see glossary), a psychiatric center, or residential health care\nfacility (see glossary) for a patient in the hospital, psychiatric center, or\nresidential health care facility pursuant to regulations promulgated by the\n\nDepartment of Health. (b) Nonhospital DNR orders (see glossary) may\nbe issued by: (1)\nan attending physician in a\ndevelopmental center, to take effect only after departure from the\ndevelopmental center; (2)\nan\nattending physician in a hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health\ncare facility, to take effect only after discharge from the hospital, psychiatric center or residential health care facility; (3)\nan attending physician in the community, to take effect upon issuance. (v) Before obtaining the consent of an adult\nperson, a health care agent, a surrogate (see glossary) of the person, or a\nparent (see glossary) or legal guardian of a minor (see glossary) to a DNR\norder, an attending physician is to provide to the party giving consent\ninformation about the person's diagnosis and prognosis, the reasonably\nforeseeable risks and benefits for cardiopulmonary resuscitation for the\nperson, and the consequences of a DNR order. (4)\n\nNonhospital DNR orders. (i) In addition to the requirements for\nnonhospital DNR orders set forth in this paragraph, all the requirements of\nthis section governing DNR orders apply to nonhospital DNR orders, unless other\nprovisions are specifically set forth. (ii)\nA nonhospital DNR order is to be issued\nin a format acceptable to the Commissioner of the Department of\n\nHealth. (iii)\n\nAn attending\nphysician who has issued a nonhospital DNR order and who transfers care of a\nperson to another physician, is to inform the physician of the order. (iv)\nA standard bracelet, developed by the\n\nCommissioner of the Department of Health, may be worn by a person with a\nnonhospital DNR order to identify that status. However, no one may require a\nperson to wear such a bracelet and no one may require a person to wear such a\nbracelet as a condition for honoring a nonhospital DNR order or providing\nhealth care services. (v) A\nnonhospital DNR order may be issued: (a) in a\ndevelopmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or health care facility, to\ntake effect only after departure from such facility; (b) in the community, to take effect upon\nissuance. (vi)\n\nFor each\nadult person for whom a nonhospital DNR order has been issued, the attending\nphysician is to review whether the order is still appropriate in light of the\nperson's condition each time he or she examines the person, but at least every\n90 days. While the review must occur at least every 90 days, the review need\nnot occur more than once every seven days. The attending physician is to record\nthe review in the medical portion of the person's clinical record provided, however, that a registered nurse who provides care to the person may record the\nreview in the record at the direction of the physician. In such case, the\nattending physician is to include a confirmation of the review in the medical\nportion of the person's clinical record within 14 days of such review. The DNR\norder remains in effect even if there is a lapse in the time frame specified\nfor the review. (vii)\n\nAny adult\nperson, health care agent, surrogate, or parent or legal guardian of a minor, who has consented to a nonhospital DNR order may at any time revoke his or her\nconsent to the order by any act evidencing a specific intent to revoke such\nconsent. Any health care professional (see glossary) informed of a revocation\nof consent to a nonhospital DNR order is to notify the attending physician of\nthe revocation. An attending physician who is informed that a nonhospital DNR\norder has been revoked is to record the revocation in the person's medical\nrecord, cancel the order and make diligent efforts to retrieve the form issuing\nthe order and the standard bracelet, if any. (viii)\n\nIf a person with a nonhospital DNR\norder relocates to a developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or\nresidential health care facility, even on a temporary basis, the continuance of\nthe order shall be governed by the provisions of paragraph (14) of this\nsubdivision, as well as the dispute mediation provisions of paragraph\n(15). (ix)\n\nIt shall be lawful for\nstaff at facilities, including staff who are designated by policy to provide\ninitial emergency medical assistance, to honor nonhospital DNR\norders. (x) Staff at facilities\noperated or licensed by OPWDD who are provided with a nonhospital DNR order, or\nwho identify the standard bracelet on a person's body, shall comply with the\nterms of such order, provided however, that such staff may disregard the order\nif: (a) they believe in good faith that\nconsent to the order has been revoked or that the order has been canceled; or\n(b) physical confrontation\nappears likely because family members or others on the scene, excluding staff, object to the order. (xi)\n\nNo one may be subjected to criminal\nprosecution or civil liability, or be deemed to have engaged in unprofessional\nconduct, for honoring reasonably and in good faith, pursuant to this section, a\nnonhospital DNR order, or for disregarding a nonhospital DNR order pursuant to\nsubparagraph (x) of this paragraph, or for other actions taken reasonably and\nin good faith pursuant to this section. (5)\n\nDetermination of capacity (see glossary)\nof an adult (see glossary) person to make a decision regarding cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation. (i) Every adult person shall be\npresumed to have the capacity to make a decision regarding cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation unless determined otherwise pursuant to this paragraph or\npursuant to a court order. A lack of capacity shall not be presumed from the\nfact that a committee of the property or conservator has been appointed for an\nadult pursuant to article 77 or 78 of the Mental Hygiene Law, or that a\nguardian has been appointed pursuant to article 17-A of the Surrogate's Court\n\nProcedure Act, or that a guardian was appointed pursuant to article 81 of the\n\nMental Health Law, unless the order of the court provides otherwise. (ii)\nA determination that an adult person\nlacks capacity is to be made by an attending physician to a reasonable degree\nof medical certainty. The determination is to be made in writing and contain\nsuch attending physician's opinion regarding the cause and nature of the\nperson's incapacity including the extent and probable duration of such\nincapacity. The determination is to be included in the medical portion of a\nperson's clinical record and the physician is to obtain a concurring opinion\nconfirming an adult person's lack of capacity pursuant to the following: (a) If an attending physician determines that\nlack of capacity of an adult person is due to a medical condition, at least one\nother physician must concur in that determination. If the person is located in\na developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health\ncare facility, the concurring opinion shall be made by a physician authorized\nby the director of that developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or\nresidential health care facility. The concurring determination is to be made in\nwriting after personal examination of the person and is to contain the\nconsulting physician's opinion regarding the cause and nature of the person's\nincapacity, including the extent and probable duration of such incapacity. Each\nconcurring determination is to be included in the medical portion of a person's\nclinical record. (b) If an\nattending physician determines that an adult person lacks capacity because of\nmental illness (see glossary), the concurring determination is to be provided\nby a physician certified or eligible to be certified by the American Board of\n\nPsychiatry and Neurology. The concurring determination is to be made in writing\nafter personal examination of the person and is to contain the consulting\nphysician's opinion regarding the cause and nature of the person's incapacity, including the extent and probable duration of such incapacity. Each concurring\ndetermination is to be included in the medical portion of a person's clinical\nrecord. (c) If an attending\nphysician determines that an adult person lacks capacity because of a\ndevelopmental disability (see glossary), the concurring determination is to be\nmade in writing after personal examination of the person by a physician or\npsychologist and is to contain his or her opinion regarding the cause and\nnature of the person's incapacity, including the extent and probable duration\nof such incapacity. Each concurring determination is to be included in the\nmedical portion of a person's clinical record. Such concurring determination\nmust be provided by: (1)\na physician licensed\nin New York State who is presently employed by a developmental center or a DDSO\nand has been so employed for at least one year; or\n(2)\na psychologist who is presently employed\nby a developmental center or a DDSO and has been so employed for at least one\nyear; or\n(3)\na physician, licensed\nin New York State, employed for a minimum of two years to render care and\nservices in a facility; or\n(4)\na\npsychologist, licensed in New York State, employed for a minimum of two years\nto render care and services in a facility; or\n(5)\na physician licensed in New York State\nwho has had specialized training in developmental disabilities and has had two\nyears experience treating those with developmental disabilities; or\n(6)\na psychologist licensed in New York State\nwho has had specialized training in developmental disabilities and has had two\nyears experience treating those with developmental disabilities; or\n(7)\na physician licensed in New York State\nwhose name and credentials have been submitted to OPWDD and who has been\napproved by the commissioner of OPWDD to render such a concurring opinion; or\n(8)\na psychologist whose name\nand credentials have been submitted to OPWDD and who has been approved by the\ncommissioner of OPWDD to render such a concurring opinion. (iii)\n\nNotice of a determination\nthat an adult person lacks capacity is to promptly be given: (a) to the person, where there is any\nindication of the person's ability to understand the notice, in the means of\ncommunication normally used with that person, advising him or her that someone\nwill be designated to give consent on his or her behalf, together with a copy\nof a statement summarizing the rights, duties and requirements of this section; and\n(b) to the party on the\nsurrogate list (see glossary) highest in order of priority listed; nothing in\nthis section precludes or requires notice to more than one party on the\nsurrogate list. When the party highest in priority is not reasonably available\n(see glossary), the immediate next party listed in subparagraph (8)(iv) of this\nsubdivision is to be notified; and\n(c) to the chief executive officer (see\nglossary) of the facility in which the person resides and/or from which the\nperson was relocated, as appropriate. (iv)\nA determination that a person lacks\ncapacity to make a decision regarding a DNR order pursuant to this section\nshall not be construed as a finding that the person lacks capacity for any\nother purpose. (6)\n\nDecisionmaking by an adult person with capacity to make a decision regarding\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation. (i) The consent\nof an adult person with capacity must be obtained prior to issuing a DNR order, except as provided in subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nIf an adult person has capacity at the\ntime the order is to be issued, the consent must be obtained at or about such\ntime, notwithstanding any prior oral or written consent. (iii)\n\nAn adult person with capacity may\nexpress a decision to consent to a DNR order as follows: (a) When an adult person is in a\ndevelopmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care\nfacility: (1)\nin ways normally used by the\nperson to communicate, in the presence of at least two witnesses, 18 years of\nage or older, one of whom is a physician at the developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care facility and recorded in the\nmedical portion of the person's clinical record; or\n(2)\nin writing, dated and signed in the\npresence of at least two witnesses 18 years of age or older who shall also sign\nthe decision. The decision shall be included in the medical portion of the\nperson's clinical record. (b) When an adult person is in the community: (1)\nto the attending physician in ways\nnormally used by the person to communicate; or\n(2)\nin writing, dated and signed in the\npresence of at least two witnesses 18 years of age or older who must also sign\nthe decision. (iv)\n\nAn attending physician who is provided\nwith or informed of a decision pursuant to this paragraph is to record or\ninclude the decision in the medical portion of the person's clinical record if\nthe decision has not been recorded or included, and either: (a) promptly issue a DNR order or issue an\norder at such time as the conditions, if any, specified in the decision are\nmet, and inform the chief executive officer of the facility in which the person\nresides, who shall ensure notification is made to the facility staff\nresponsible for the person's care, of the order; or\n(b) promptly make his or her objection to the\nissuance of such an order and the reasons therefore known to the person and\neither make all reasonable efforts to arrange for the transfer of the person to\nanother physician, if necessary; or promptly submit the matter to the dispute\nmediation system as discussed in paragraph (15) of this subdivision, if\napplicable. (v) Prior to\nissuing a DNR order, for an adult person who has expressed a decision\nconsenting to a DNR order under specified medical conditions, an attending\nphysician must make a determination to a reasonable degree of medical\ncertainty, that such conditions exist, and include the determination in the\nmedical portion of the person's clinical record. An attending physician is to\nnotify the person of such determination and his or her intent to issue a DNR\norder. (vi)\n\nIn the event that an\nattending physician determines that, to a reasonable degree of medical\ncertainty, an adult person who has capacity would suffer immediate and severe\ninjury from a discussion of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and has documented\nthis in the medical portion of the person's clinical record, the attending\nphysician may issue a DNR order without obtaining the person's consent, but\nonly after: (a) ascertaining the wishes of the\nperson to the extent possible without subjecting the person to a risk of\nimmediate and severe injury; (b) including the reasons for not consulting the person in the medical portion of\nthe person's clinical record; and\n(c) obtaining the consent of a health care\nagent or a surrogate pursuant to paragraph (8) of this subdivision. However, the consent of a health care agent or a surrogate is not required if the person\nhas previously consented to a DNR order pursuant to this paragraph; (d) for persons in a developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center or residential health care facility, consulting\nwith and obtaining the written concurrence of another physician selected by the\ndirector of that developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or\nresidential health care facility, or selected by a party authorized by the\ndirector to do so. Such concurrence shall be given after personal examination\nof the person concerning the assessment of immediate and severe injury to the\nperson from a decision to use cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (vii)\n\nWhere the provisions of\nsubparagraph (vi) of this paragraph have been invoked, an attending physician\nreassess, on a regular basis, a person's risk of injury from a decision to use\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation, and is to consult with the person regarding\nresuscitation as soon as the medical basis for not consulting with the person\nno longer exists. (7)\n\nNotice of consent. (i) The chief executive\noffice of the facility in which a person resides is to be advised at any time a\nDNR order is issued, whether issued as a nonhospital order or whether issued in\na developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center or residential health care\nfacility. However notification to the chief executive officer of a facility is\nnot to delay issuance of a DNR order. If a chief executive officer concludes\nthat the person lacks capacity or that issuance of a DNR order may be\ninconsistent with the person's wishes or that the order fails to meet the\nnecessary requirements spelled out in this section and if the person is in a\ndevelopmental center, hospital, psychiatric center or residential health care\nfacility, the chief executive officer shall submit the matter to the\nappropriate dispute mediation system (see glossary). Otherwise, the chief\nexecutive officer may seek judicial review in conformance with paragraph (16)\nof this subdivision. (ii)\n\nIf a\nperson is in a developmental center, notice of a person's consent to a DNR\norder, or of a health care agent's consent to a DNR order, or of a surrogate's\nconsent to a DNR order, is also to be given to the director of the\ndevelopmental center in which the person is located at the time the consent was\ngiven. Such notice shall be given prior to the issuance of a DNR order. Notification to the director shall not delay issuance of a DNR order. (8)\n\nSurrogate decisionmaking. (i) The consent of a health care agent who is\navailable and who is authorized to make a decision regarding cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation if a person lacks the capacity to do so must be obtained prior to\nissuing a DNR order. If, there is no such agent, consent of a surrogate acting\non behalf of an adult person who lacks capacity to make a decision regarding\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation, or on behalf of an adult person for whom consent\nby a surrogate is authorized by subparagraph (8)(iv) of this subdivision must\nbe obtained prior to issuing a DNR order except as provided in subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph or paragraph (9) of this subdivision. (ii)\nA decision regarding cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation by a health care agent on a person's behalf is governed by\nsection\n633.20\nof this Part and article\n29-C of the New York State Public Health Law and has priority over decisions by\nany other party except the person or as otherwise provided in a health care\nproxy. (iii)\n\nThe consent of a\nsurrogate or a health care agent is not required where an adult person, prior\nto losing capacity to consent, had consented to a DNR order pursuant to\nsubparagraph (6)(iii), (iv), or (v) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nOne party (in the order of priority\nlisted) from the following list, has the authority to act as surrogate on\nbehalf of a person, when that person is not competent to make a decision and\nthat person has not appointed a health care agent. When the party highest in\npriority listed below is not reasonably available, the immediate next party is\nto be solicited. (a) a \"committee of the\nperson\" or a guardian appointed pursuant to article 17-A of the Surrogate's\n\nCourt Procedure Act, provided that this clause will not be construed to require\nthe appointment of a \"committee of the person\" or guardian for the purpose of\nmaking the resuscitation decision; (b) the spouse; (c) a son or daughter who is 18 years of age\nor older; (d) a parent; (e) a brother or sister who is 18 years of\nage or older; and\n(f) a close\nfriend (see glossary). (v) After a surrogate has been identified, the name of such party is to be included in the medical portion of a person's\nclinical record. (vi)\n\nThe\nunavailability of prior parties or the unwillingness to make a decision by\nprior parties on the surrogate's list is to be documented in the medical\nportion of a person's clinical record. (vii)\nA determination that a surrogate is not\ncompetent to act as surrogate is to be documented with the reasons therefore in\nthe medical portion of a person's clinical record and may be the subject of an\nappeal to the dispute mediation system by a surrogate, if a person is in a\ndevelopmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care\nfacility. (viii)\nA surrogate is to\nmake a decision regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the basis of the\nadult person's wishes including a consideration of the person's religious and\nmoral beliefs, or, if the person's wishes are unknown and cannot be\nascertained, on the basis of the person's best interests. (ix)\n\nNotwithstanding any law to the contrary, a surrogate is to have the same right as a person to receive medical\ninformation and the medical portion of the clinical record. (x) A surrogate may consent to a DNR order on\nbehalf of an adult person only if there has been a determination by an\nattending physician with the concurrence of another physician, given only after\npersonal examination of the person that, to a reasonable degree of medical\ncertainty: (a) the person has a terminal\ncondition (see glossary); or\n(b) the person is permanently unconscious; or\n(c) resuscitation would be medically futile\n(see glossary); or\n(d) resuscitation would impose an extraordinary burden on the person in light of\nthe person's medical condition and the expected outcome of resuscitation for\nthe person. (xi)\n\nFor the\npurpose of subparagraph (x) of this paragraph, if the person is in a\ndevelopmental center, the attending physician shall seek the concurrence of\nanother physician selected by the director of the developmental\ncenter. (xii)\n\nEach determination\nand a brief statement of the reasons therefor are to be included in the medical\nportion of a person's clinical record. (xiii)\nA surrogate is to express a decision\nconsenting to a DNR order: (a) in writing, dated, and signed in the presence of one witness 18 years of age or older who\nis to sign the decision; or\n(b) if\nthe person is in a developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or\nresidential health care facility, such decision may be made orally, to two\nparties 18 years of age or older, one of whom is a physician affiliated with\nthat developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health\ncare facility. Any such decision is to be recorded in the medical portion of a\nperson's clinical record. (xiv)\nA health care agent may consent orally, to the attending physician, to a nonhospital DNR order. (xv)\n\nIn a developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center or residential health care facility, an attending physician\nwho is provided with the decision of a surrogate shall include the decision in\nthe medical portion of a person's clinical record, and, if the surrogate has\nconsented to the issuance of a DNR order, shall either: (a) promptly issue a DNR order and ensure\nthat the developmental center staff responsible for the person's care are\ninformed of the order; or\n(b) promptly make the attending physician's objection to the issuance of such an\norder known to the surrogate and either make all reasonable efforts to arrange\nfor the transfer of the person to another physician, if necessary, or promptly\nrefer the matter to the dispute mediation system. (xvi)\n\nIf a person is in a developmental\ncenter, hospital, psychiatric center or residential health care facility, notice of a surrogate's consent to a DNR order is to be given to the director\nof the developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential\nhealth care facility in which a person is located at the time the consent was\ngiven, as well as to the chief executive officer of the residential facility in\nwhich a person resides at the time the consent is given or from which the\nperson was relocated, if applicable. Such notice is to be given prior to the\nissuance pursuant to this section of a DNR order. Notification to a director of\na developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center or residential health care\nfacility and/or the chief executive officer of the facility in which a person\nresides or from which a person has been relocated, if applicable, will not\ndelay issuance of a DNR order. If a director of a developmental center or other\nchief executive officer, if applicable, concludes that a person has capacity or\nthat issuance of a DNR order is otherwise inconsistent with this section, the\ndirector at the developmental center and/or other chief executive officer shall\nsubmit the matter to the appropriate dispute mediation system. (xvii)\n\nIf a person is in a developmental\ncenter, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care facility, and\nan attending physician has actual notice of opposition to a surrogate's consent\nto a DNR order by any party on the surrogate list, the physician is to submit\nthe matter to the appropriate dispute mediation system and such order must not\nbe issued or must be revoked in accordance with the provisions of paragraph\n(12) of this subdivision. (xviii)\n\nFor persons residing in facilities other than developmental centers, notice of\na surrogate's consent to a DNR order is to be given to the chief executive\nofficer of the facility in which the person resides. Such notice is to be given\nprior to the issuance of the DNR order, pursuant to this section. Notification\nto a chief executive officer is not to delay issuance of a DNR order. If a\nperson is in a developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or\nresidential health care facility, and a chief executive officer concludes that\na person has capacity or that issuance of a DNR order is otherwise inconsistent\nwith this section, the chief executive officer shall submit the matter to the\nappropriate dispute mediation system. Otherwise, the chief executive officer\nmay seek judicial review in conformance with paragraph (16) of this\nsubdivision. (xix)\n\nIf a surrogate\nhas consented to a DNR order, notice of the surrogate's decision must be given\nto the person where there is any indication of the person's ability to\ncomprehend such notice, except if a determination has been made pursuant to\nsubparagraph (6)(vi) of this subdivision. If the person objects, a DNR order\nshall not be issued. (9)\n\nDecisionmaking on behalf of an adult person without capacity for whom no\nsurrogate is available and for whom no health care agent has been appointed. (i) If a surrogate is: (a) not reasonably available; or\n(b) not willing to make a decision regarding\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation; or\n(c) not competent to make a decision\nregarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and\n(ii)\n\nIf a person lacks capacity to make a\ndecision regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation or if a person, when\ncapacitated, did not previously consent to the issuance of a DNR order, then an\nattending physician: (a) may issue a DNR\norder, provided that the attending physician determines, and documents in the\nmedical portion of a person's clinical record, that to a reasonable degree of\nmedical certainty, resuscitation would be medically futile, and another\nphysician, after personal examination of the person, reviews and concurs in\nwriting with such determination (if the person is located in a developmental\ncenter, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care facility, the\nsecond physician shall be a physician authorized by the director of that\ndevelopmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care\nfacility); or\n(b) issues a DNR\norder provided that a court has granted a judgment directing the issuance of\nsuch an order; and\n(c) documents in\nthe medical portion of a person's clinical record that no surrogate was\navailable, competent or willing to make a decision regarding cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation for the person. (iii)\n\nFor a person who is in a developmental\ncenter, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care facility, prior to issuance of a DNR order pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph, notice of such order is to be given to the director of the\ndevelopmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care\nfacility in which the person is located at the time the decision to issue a DNR\norder is made, and/or to the chief executive officer of the residential\nfacility from which the person was relocated, if applicable. Notification to\nthe director and/or other chief executive officer is not to delay issuance of a\nDNR order. If a director and/or other chief executive officer concludes that a\nperson has capacity or that issuance of a DNR order is otherwise inconsistent\nwith this section, the director and/or other chief executive officer shall\nsubmit the matter to the appropriate dispute mediation system. (iv)\n\nFor a person residing in a facility\nother than a developmental center, notice is to be given to the chief executive\nofficer of that facility. Notification to the chief executive officer is not to\ndelay issuance of a DNR order. (v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, where a decision to\nconsent to a DNR order has been made, notice of the decision is to be given to\nthe person where there is any indication of the person's ability to comprehend\nsuch notice, except where a determination has been made pursuant to paragraph\n(6) of this subdivision. If the person objects, a DNR order is not to be\nissued. (10)\n\nDecisionmaking on behalf of a person who is a minor (see glossary). (i) An attending physician, in consultation\nwith a minor's parent or legal guardian, is to determine whether a minor has\nthe capacity to make a decision regarding resuscitation. (ii)\n\nThe consent of a minor's parent or legal\nguardian and the consent of the minor, if the minor has capacity, must be\nobtained prior to issuing a DNR order for the minor. (iii)\nA parent or legal guardian may consent\nto a DNR order on behalf of a minor only if there has been a written\ndetermination by the attending physician, with the written concurrence of\nanother physician, given after personal examination of the minor, that, to a\nreasonable degree of medical certainty, the minor suffers from one of the\nmedical conditions set forth in subparagraph (8)(x) of this subdivision. If the\nperson is in a developmental center, the concurring opinion shall be given by a\nphysician authoried by the director of the developmental center. Each\ndetermination is to be documented in the medical portion of a minor's clinical\nrecord. (iv)\n\nWhere an attending\nphysician has reason to believe that there is another parent or a noncustodial\nparent who has not been informed of a decision to issue a DNR order for the\nminor, the attending physician, or someone acting on behalf of the attending\nphysician, is to make reasonable efforts to determine if the uninformed parent\nor noncustodial parent has maintained substantial and continuous contact with\nthe minor and, if so, is to make diligent efforts to notify that parent or\nnoncustodial parent of the decision prior to issuing the order. (v) For a minor who is located in a\ndevelopmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care\nfacility, notice of a decision to issue a DNR order for a minor is to be given\nto the director of the developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or\nresidential health care facility in which the minor is located at the time the\nconsent is given, and/or to the chief executive officer of the residential\nfacility from which the minor was relocated, if applicable. Such notice is to\nbe given prior to issuance of a DNR order. Notification to a director or other\nchief executive officer is not to delay issuance of a DNR order. If a director\nor other chief executive officer concludes that issuance of a DNR order is\ninconsistent with this section, the director or other chief executive officer\nis to submit the matter to the appropriate dispute mediation system. (vi)\nA parent or legal guardian of a person\nwho is a minor, in making a decision regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is to consider the minor's wishes, including a consideration of the minor's\nreligious and moral beliefs, and is to express a decision consenting to\nissuance of a DNR order: (a) in writing, dated, and signed in the presence of one witness who is 18 years of age or\nolder who must also sign the decision; or\n(b) if a person is in a developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care facility, such\ndecision may be made orally, to two parties 18 years of age or older, one of\nwhom is a physician affiliated with that developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care facility in which the person is\nbeing treated. Any such decision shall be recorded in the medical portion of a\nperson's clinical record. (vii)\n\nAn attending physician who is provided\nwith the decision of a minor's parent or legal guardian, expressed pursuant to\nthis paragraph, and of the minor if the minor has capacity, is to include such\ndecision or decisions in the medical portion of a minor's clinical\nrecord. (viii)\n\nIf a minor is in a\ndevelopmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care\nfacility and an attending physician has actual notice of the opposition of a\nparent, noncustodial parent, or legal guardian of a minor to consent by another\nparent to a DNR order for a minor, the physician is to submit the matter to the\nappropriate dispute mediation system and such order cannot be issued or must be\nrevoked in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (12) of this\nsubdivision. (ix)\n\nIf a parent or\nlegal guardian of a minor has consented to a DNR order, notice of the parent or\nlegal guardian's decision is to be given to the minor where there is any\nindication of the minor's ability to comprehend such notice, except if a\ndetermination has been made pursuant to subparagraph (6)(vi) of this\nsubdivision. If the minor objects, a DNR order cannot be issued. (11)\n\nMedical treatment. Consent to\nthe issuance of a DNR order does not constitute consent to withhold or withdraw\nmedical treatment other than cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (12)\n\nRevocation of consent. (i) A person, including a minor, or a health\ncare agent may, at any time, revoke his or her consent to a DNR order by any\nact or communication evidencing a specific intent to revoke such consent. Such\nact or communication may be, but is not limited to, an oral or written\ndeclaration to a physician, or to a member of the nursing staff or other staff\nmembers at a facility certified or operated by OPWDD; or, when located in a\nhospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care facility, to a\nphysician or member of the nursing staff there. (ii)\n\nAny surrogate, parent, or legal guardian\nmay at any time revoke his or her consent to a DNR order by: (a) notifying a physician or member of the\nnursing staff, of the revocation of consent in writing, dated and signed; or\n(b) orally notifying the\nattending physician in the presence of a witness 18 years of age or\nolder. (iii)\n\nIf, at any\ntime, a person objects, by any means he or she typically uses to communicate, to a DNR order authorized by a surrogate or health care agent, said DNR order\nmust either not be issued or must be withdrawn. (iv)\n\nAny physician who is informed of or\nprovided with a revocation of consent pursuant to this paragraph must\nimmediately include the revocation in the medical portion of a person's\nclinical record, cancel the order, and notify the chief executive officer of\nthe facility where the person resides, who shall ensure that notification is\nmade to staff responsible for the person's care, of the revocation and\ncancellation. If the order is a nonhospital DNR order, the physician is to make\ndiligent efforts to retrieve the form issuing the order, and the standard\nbracelet, if any. (v) Any member of\nthe nursing staff or other facility staff with responsibilities for a person, who is informed of or provided with a revocation of consent, except pursuant to\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, shall immediately notify a physician of\nsuch revocation. (13)\n\nPhysician review. (i) For each person for whom\na DNR order has been issued, an attending physician is to review the person's\nclinical record and medical condition to determine if the order is still\nappropriate in light of the person's condition and is to indicate in the\nmedical portion of the person's clinical record that the order has been\nreviewed: (a) for a person located in a\ndevelopmental center, at least every seven days; (b) for each person for whom a nonhospital\nDNR order has been issued, the attending physician is to review whether the\norder is still appropriate in light of the person's condition each time he or\nshe examines the person, whether in a hospital or elsewhere, but at least every\n90 days, provided that the review need not occur more than once every seven\ndays. The attending physician is to record the review in the medical portion of\na person's clinical record provided, however, that a registered nurse who\nprovides direct care to the person may record the review in the clinical record\nat the direction of the physician. In such case, the attending physician is to\ninclude a confirmation of the review in the medical portion of a person's\nclinical record within 14 days of such review. (ii)\n\nFailure to comply with subparagraph (i)\nof this paragraph does not render a DNR order invalid. (iii)\n\nIf an attending physician determines at\nany time that a DNR order is no longer appropriate because a person's medical\ncondition has improved, the physician is to immediately notify the party who\nconsented to the order. Except as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this\nparagraph, if such party declines to revoke consent to the order, the physician\nis to promptly: (a) make reasonable efforts to\narrange for the transfer of care of the person to another physician, if\nnecessary; or\n(b) submit the matter\nto the dispute mediation system, if appropriate. (iv)\n\nIf a DNR order was entered upon the\nconsent of a surrogate, parent, or legal guardian and the attending physician\nwho issued the order, or, if unavailable, another attending physician, at any\ntime determines that a person does not suffer from one of the medical\nconditions set forth in subparagraph (8)(x) of this subdivision, the attending\nphysician shall immediately include such determination in the person's record, cancel the order, and notify the person who consented to the order and the\nchief executive officer of the facility where the person resides, who shall\nensure that notification is made to all staff responsible for the person's care\nof the cancellation. (v) If a DNR\norder was entered upon the consent of a surrogate and the person at any time\ngains or regains capacity, the attending physician who issued the order, or, if\nunavailable, another attending physician, is to immediately cancel the order\nand notify the party who consented to the order and the chief executive officer\nof the facility where the person resides, who shall ensure that notification is\nmade to all staff directly responsible for the person's care of the\ncancellation. (14)\n\nRelocation. (i) If a person for whom a DNR\norder has been issued is to be relocated to a developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care facility, the ambulance\npersonnel, if such are involved, and the receiving developmental center, hospital, psychiatric center, or residential health care facility shall be\nadvised of the order. (ii)\n\nThe\norder remains effective, unless revoked pursuant to this section, until the\nattending physician first examines the transferred person, whereupon the\nattending physician must either: (a) issue an\norder continuing the prior DNR order, and such order may be issued without\nobtaining further consent from the person, surrogate or parent pursuant to this\nsection; or\n(b) cancel the DNR\norder, provided the attending physician immediately notifies the person who\nconsented to the order and, if in a developmental center, ensures that\nnotification is made to the developmental center staff responsible for the\nperson's care of the cancellation. Such cancellation does not preclude the\nentry of a new order pursuant to this section. (15)\n\nDispute mediation system (DMS) at\ndevelopmental centers when a person is located at a developmental center or\nsmall residential unit (SRU). (i) (i) Dispute mediation systems are available\nat developmental centers, hospitals, psychiatric centers, and residential\nhealth care facilities licensed pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health\n\nLaw. Dispute mediation may apply to a nonhospital DNR order only if the person\nis located in one of the aforementioned facilities at the time the dispute is\nbrought to the attention of its staff. (ii)\n\nThe requirements below for dispute\nmediation only apply to DNR orders that are effective while a person is located\nin a developmental center. (iii)\n\nEach developmental center shall establish a dispute mediation system for the\npurpose of mediating any disputes related to DNR orders for persons located in\nthe developmental center, including disputes regarding: (a) determination of a person's capacity to\nmake a decision regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation; (b) issuance of a DNR order; or\n(c) determination of a surrogate's competence\npursuant to subparagraph (8)(vii) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nOnly the dispute mediation system\nestablished for the developmental center in which a person is located at the\ntime of a dispute shall have the authority to mediate that dispute. (v) The dispute mediation system shall not\nhave the authority to make a determination on whether a DNR order shall be\nissued. (vi)\n\nThe dispute mediation\nsystem shall attempt to resolve the dispute between the parties and aid the\nparties in reaching a mutually agreeable decision. (vii)\n\nThe dispute mediation system shall be\ndescribed in writing. (viii)\nA\ndevelopmental center may utilize already existing mechanisms for its dispute\nmediation system membership, or may create a body specifically for this\npurpose. (ix)\n\nIf a dispute involves\na person deemed to lack capacity pursuant to either clause\n(5)(ii)(\nb\n) or (\nc\n) of this subdivision, the\nmembership of the dispute mediation system must include: (a) a physician qualified to give a\nconcurring determination regarding capacity pursuant to clause\n(5)(ii)(\nb\n) or (\nc\n) of this subdivision, whichever is applicable; or\n(b) a\nfamily member or a \"guardian of the person\" of any person with a mental illness\nor developmental disability of the same or similar nature. (x) No relative, correspondent, surrogate or\npotential surrogate, or any party involved in any decisionmaking process or\nprocedure that resulted in the determination of capacity or in the issuance of\na DNR order for a person whose case is in dispute may serve as a member of the\ndispute mediation system reviewing that case. (xi)\n\nThe dispute mediation system is\nauthorized to mediate disputes regarding the issuance of a DNR order and\ndisputes regarding determination of capacity arising under this section: (a) between a person and an attending\nphysician or the developmental center caring for the person; or\n(b) between a person who is a minor and an\nattending physician or the developmental center caring for the minor; or\nbetween a minor and the minor's parent or legal guardian; or\n(c) among an attending physician, a parent, a\nnoncustodial parent, a legal guardian, anyone on the surrogate list, or the\ndevelopmental center, or the chief executive officer of the facility from which\nthe person was relocated. (xii)\n\nUpon submission of a dispute regarding\nthe issuance of a DNR order to the dispute mediation system, a DNR order cannot\nbe issued, or must be revoked and may not be reissued until: (a) the dispute has been resolved or the\ndispute mediation system has concluded its efforts to resolve the dispute; or\n(b) 72 hours have elapsed from\nthe time of submission of the dispute, whichever shall occur first; or\n(c) the 72-hour period shall\nbegin upon submission, by any authorized party, either orally or in writing, of\nan objection to the issuance of a DNR order to any member of the developmental\ncenter's dispute mediation system. (xiii)\n\nIf a dispute between a person\nexpressing a decision consenting to a DNR order and an attending physician or\nthe developmental center that is caring for the person is submitted to the\ndispute mediation system and either the dispute mediation system has concluded\nits efforts to mediate the dispute without resolution; or 72 hours have elapsed\nfrom the time of submission without resolution of the dispute, whichever shall\noccur first, the attending physician is to either: (a) promptly issue a DNR order or issue the\norder at such time as the conditions, if any, specified in the decision are\nmet, and inform the developmental center staff responsible for the person's\ncare of the issuance of the order; or\n(b) promptly arrange for the transfer of the\nperson to another physician. (xiv)\n\nIf any other dispute between parties\nlisted in subparagraph (x) of this paragraph is submitted to the dispute\nmediation system, and the dispute mediation system has concluded its efforts to\nmediate the dispute without resolution; or 72 hours have elapsed from the time\nof submission without resolution of the dispute, whichever occurs first, an\nattending physician may: (a) reissue the\noriginal order; or\n(b) refuse to\nreissue the original order and inform the disputants of their right to judicial\nreview as provided below in paragraph (16) of this subdivision. (16)\n\nJudicial review. (i) An adult person; an\nattending physician; a parent, non-custodial parent, or a legal guardian of a\nperson who is a minor; any party on the surrogate list; the director of the\ndevelopmental center that is caring for a person; and, if the person is in or\nwas moved from a residential facility, the chief executive officer of that\nfacility, may commence a special proceeding pursuant to article 4 of the Civil\n\nPractice Law and Rules, in a court of competent jurisdiction, with respect to\nany dispute arising under this section, except that the decision of any person\nrefusing to consent to or objecting to the issuance of a DNR order may not be\nsubjected to judicial review. (ii)\n\nIn any proceeding brought challenging a decision regarding the issuance of a\nDNR order on the ground that the decision is contrary to a person's wishes or\nbest interests, the party or entity challenging the decision must show by clear\nand convincing evidence that the decision is contrary to the person's wishes\nincluding consideration of the person's religious and moral beliefs, or, in the\nabsence of evidence of the person's wishes, the decision is contrary to the\nperson's best interests. (iii)\n\nIn\nany other proceeding brought pursuant to this paragraph, the court will make\nits determination based upon the applicable substantive standards and\nprocedures set forth in this section, and article 29-B of the Public Health\n\nLaw.

(v) Where a party or entity\nhas invoked the dispute mediation system, no such judicial proceeding can be\ncommenced until the dispute mediation system has concluded its efforts to\nresolve the dispute or 72 hours have elapsed from the submission of the dispute\nto the dispute mediation system, whichever shall occur first. However, a person\nwho is or would be the subject of a DNR order may commence an action for relief\nwith respect to any dispute under this section at any time. Further, the\n\nDepartment of Health, OPWDD, or any other duly authorized State agency may\ncommence an action or proceeding to enjoin a violation of this section at any\ntime.
