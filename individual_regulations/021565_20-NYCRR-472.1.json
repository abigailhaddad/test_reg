  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 472.1 - Determination of maximum gross weight\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 501, subd. 4\n(a) As heretofore indicated every vehicle\nhaving a maximum gross weight of more than 18,000 pounds is required to have a\npermit. It is therefore necessary to determine the meaning of \"maximum gross\nweight\". (b) The\nmaximum\ngross weight\nof the motor vehicle is the unloaded weight of the\nvehicle plus the maximum load, exclusive of the weight of the driver and his\nhelper, to be carried or hauled by it on New York public highways. This\nprovision in the statute is designed to provide a constant weight factor for\nthe computation of the tax. Accordingly, a particular motor vehicle will have\nthe same maximum gross weight although it may carry a light bulky cargo on one\ntrip and a heavy metal cargo on the next trip. The maximum load to be carried\nshould be determined by the applicant for the permit. The maximum gross weight\nas set forth in the application is subject to audit and approval by the\ncommission. (See §\n472.6, infra, for determination of unloaded weight.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n472.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
