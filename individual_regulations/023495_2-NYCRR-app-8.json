ARTHUR LEVITT\nState Comptroller\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Statutory Reference. At each Item of indebtedness to be\nincluded and excluded in the debt statement will be found a statutory\nreference. For example, \"135.00(a, 1)\" means \"subdivision 1 of paragraph a of\nsection\n135.00\nof\nthe Local Finance Law\". Reference to that section in the Local Finance Law will\nshow the statutory meaning of the word \"Borrowings\". Wherever a reference\nappears, that section of the Local Finance Law should be consulted. 2. Date of Preparation. The statement must be prepared as of a\ndate not more than thirty days previous to the date of sale of bonds. Local\n\nFinance Law, section 109.00. 3. Filing. A debt statement must be filed not more than fifteen\ndays nor less than three days before a municipality sells any bonds which are\nrequired to be sold at public sale. The statement must be filed with the State\n\nComptroller and a duplicate copy must be filed with the clerk or corresponding\nofficer of the municipality. It is not necessary to file a copy in the county\nclerk's office. Local Finance Law, section 109.00. 4. Fees for Copies. Should it be necessary to obtain either a\ncopy, certified copy, or exemplified copy of a debt statement filed with the\n\nState Comptroller, see paragraph c of section\n141.00\nof\nthe Local Finance Law, as added by Chapter 437 of the Laws of 1947, for fee\nschedule. The statute requires such fees to be prepaid. 5. Average Full Valuation. In computing \"Average Full\n\nValuation\" at page 4, use last completed assessment roll and four preceding\nrolls. A completed assessment roll is one which has been completed, verified\nand filed by the assessors and for which a State equalization rate has been\nestablished. The words \"For Fiscal Year Ending\" refer to the year for which\ntaxes have been or will be extended on the assessment roll rather than the year\nin which the roll was completed. The amounts to be used in Column 1 would be\nthe amounts shown on such rolls as filed after the hearing of grievances, regardless of subsequent changes. In Column 1, include the assessed valuations\nof special franchises but exclude the assessed valuations of all exempt\nproperties to the extent they are exempt from general taxation. Full valuation\n(Column 3) is determined as follows: Divide the assessed valuations (Column 1)\nby the equalization rate (Column 2) established by the State for such\nvaluation. Where boundary changes have occurred and in the case of\nnewly-created municipalities, see section\n2.00\n(7-a)\nof the Local Finance Law. In the case of counties, average full valuation is computed by\ndividing the assessed valuations on the last completed and four preceding\nassessment rolls of the cities and towns therein by the equalization rates\nestablished for such rolls; provided, however, in a county having a county\ndepartment of assessment the State equalization rates established for the\ncities and towns therein on the basis of the county roll shall be applied to\nthe apportionate portions of the county roll. The sum of the quotients thus\nobtained shall be divided by five. 6. INCLUSIONS: Re Item 8, Page 4. Include the respective amounts of all\nseveral indebtedness and allocated or apportioned joint indebtedness contracted\nor incurred pursuant to Article II, Title 1-A of the Local Finance Law in\nrelation to a joint service or a joint water, sewage or drainage project.

(Page 1)\n\nForm A.C. 973-2\n\nJoint indebtedness to be included arising out of real property\nliabilities and contract liabilities should not exceed the amount of such\nindebtedness required to be allocated and apportioned to the municipality in\nthe agreement of the participating municipalities in relation to such joint\nservice or project. Where the agreement does not provide for any such\nallocation or apportionment, or in the case of involuntary joint indebtedness, the amount to be allocated and apportioned and included in the debt statement\nof a participating municipality should be in the same proportion as the full\nvaluation of the real estate subject to taxation or assessment by such\nmunicipality for such joint service or project bears to the full valuation of\nthe real estate subject to taxation or assessment by all of the participating\nmunicipalities for such joint service or project. See Local Finance Law, section 15.10. H owever, if the State Comptroller has issued a certificate\nallocating and apportioning such joint indebtedness pursuant to the provisions\nof section\n15.10\nof\nthe Local Finance Law, the amounts so allocated and apportioned by the State\n\nComptroller should be included in the debt statements of each respective\nmunicipality as indebtedness. 7.
