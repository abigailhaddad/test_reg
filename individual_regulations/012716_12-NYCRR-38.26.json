  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.26 - Respiratory protection and controls to restrict internal exposure in restricted areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Use of process or other controls. (1)\n\nThe\nlicensee shall use, to the extent practicable, process or other engineering\ncontrols such as containment or ventilation to control the concentrations of\nradioactive material in air. (2)\n\nWhen it is not practicable to apply process or other engineering controls to\ncontrol the concentrations of radioactive material in air to values below those\nthat define an airborne radioactivity area, the licensee or registrant shall, consistent with maintaining the total effective dose equivalent ALARA, increase\nmonitoring and limit intakes by one or more of the following means: (i) control of access; or\n(ii)\nlimitation of exposure times; or\n(iii)\nuse of respiratory\nprotection equipment; or\n(iv)\nother\ncontrols. (b) Use of individual respiratory protection equipment. (1)\n\nIf the licensee or registrant uses\nrespiratory protection equipment to limit intakes pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)\nof this section: (i) Except as provided in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph the licensee or registrant shall use only\nrespiratory protection equipment that is tested and certified or had\ncertification extended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and\n\nHealth/Mine Safety and Health Administration (NIOSH/MSHA). (ii)\n\nIf the licensee wishes to use equipment\nthat has not been tested or certified by NIOSH/MSHA, has not had certification\nextended by NIOSH/MSHA, or for which there is no schedule for testing or\ncertification, the licensee or registrant shall submit an application for\nauthorized use of that equipment, including a demonstration by testing, or a\ndemonstration on the basis of reliable test information, that the material and\nperformance characteristics of the equipment are capable of providing the\nproposed degree of protection under anticipated conditions of use. (iii)\n\nThe licensee shall implement and\nmaintain a respiratory protection program that includes: (a) air sampling sufficient to identify the\npotential hazard, permit proper equipment selection, and estimate\nexposures; (b) surveys and\nbioassays, as appropriate, to evaluate actual intakes; (c) testing of respirators for operability\nimmediately prior to each use; (d) written procedures regarding selection, fitting, issuance, maintenance, and\ntesting of respirators, including testing for operability immediately prior to\neach use; supervision and training of personnel; monitoring, including air\nsampling and bioassays; and recordkeeping; and\n(e) determination by a physician prior to\ninitial fitting of respirators, and at least every 12 months thereafter, that\nthe individual user is physically able to use the respiratory protection\nequipment. (iv)\n\nThe\nlicensee or registrant shall issue a written policy statement on respirator\nusage covering: (a) the use of process or\nother engineering controls, instead of respirators; (b) the routine, none-routine, and emergency\nuse of respirators; and\n(c) the\nlength of periods of respirator use and relief from respirator use. (v) The licensee or registrant\nshall advise each respirator user that the user may leave the area at any time\nfor relief from respirator use in the event of equipment malfunction, physical\nor psychological distress, procedural or communication failure, significant\ndeterioration of operating conditions, or any other conditions that might\nrequire such relief. (vi)\n\nThe\nlicensee or registrant shall use equipment within the equipment manufacturer's\nexpressed limitations for type and mode of use and shall provide proper visual, communication, and other special capabilities, such as adequate skin\nprotection, when needed. (2)\n\nWhen estimating exposure of individuals\nto airborne radioactive materials, the licensee or registrant may make\nallowance for respiratory protection equipment used to limit intakes pursuant\nto paragraph (a)(2) of this section, provided that the following conditions, in\naddition to those in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, are satisfied: (i) The licensee selects respiratory\nprotection equipment that provides a protection factor greater than the\nmultiple by which peak concentrations of airborne radioactive materials in the\nworking area are expected to exceed the values specified in Appendix A-13, Table I, Column 3, infra. However, if the selection of respiratory protection\nwith a protection factor greater than this multiple is inconsistent with the\ngoal specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, of keeping the total\neffective dose equivalent ALARA, the licensee or registrant may select\nrespiratory protection equipment with a lower protection factor provided that\nsuch a selection would result in total effective dose equivalent that is ALARA. The concentration of radioactive material in the air that is inhaled when\nrespirators are worn may be initially estimated by dividing the average\nconcentration in air, during each period of uninterrupted use, by the\nprotection factor. If the exposure is later found to be greater than initially\nestimated, the corrected value shall be used; if the exposure is later found to\nbe less than initially estimated, the corrected value may be used. (ii)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall obtain\nauthorization from the commissioner before assigning respiratory protection\nfactors in excess of those specified in Table 6 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule). The\ncommissioner may authorize a licensee or registrant to use higher protection\nfactors upon receipt of an application that: (a) describes the situation for which a need\nexists for higher protection factors; and\n(b) demonstrates that the respiratory\nprotection equipment provides these higher protection factors under the\nproposed conditions of use. (3)\n\nIn an emergency, the licensee shall use\nas emergency equipment only respiratory protection equipment that has been\nspecifically certified or had certification extended for emergency use by the\n\nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Mine Safety and\n\nHealth Administration. (4)\n\nThe\nlicensee shall notify the commissioner in writing at least 30 days before the\ndate that respiratory protection equipment is first used pursuant to this\nsubdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n38.26\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
