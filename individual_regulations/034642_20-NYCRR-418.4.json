  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 418.4 - Licensing of terminal operators\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 283-b\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, upon application of a person who or which\nhas the use or control or the right to use or control a motor fuel storage\nfacility with a storage capacity of 50,000 gallons or more (other than a\nfacility at which motor fuel is stored solely for its retail sale at such\nfacility), may license such person as a terminal operator. Regardless of the\nactual amount of motor fuel stored at such a facility, no person, unless so\nlicensed, may operate any facility in the State where motor fuel is deposited, if the facility is suitable to accommodate the storage of 50,000 gallons or\nmore of such product. Provided, however, where motor fuel is stored by a person\nsolely for such person's own use and consumption, no license as a terminal\noperator is required. An application for a license as a terminal operator must\nbe made on a form prescribed by the Department of Taxation and Finance for such\npurpose and must fully disclose all of the information requested\ntherein. (2)\n(i) A terminal operator must immediately\ninform the Department of Taxation and Finance, in writing, of any change in its\naddress. Additionally, a terminal operator which is a corporation or a\npartnership must immediately inform the department, in writing, of any changes\nin such operator's officers, directors or partners or any changes in such\npersons' addresses as shown in the operator's application for a\nlicense. (ii)\n\nWhen shares of stock\nare acquired by any person such that a terminal operator which had four or\nfewer shareholders owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, the voting\nstock of such terminal operator upon such acquisition has more than four\nshareholders so owning or controlling such stock, the terminal operator must\nimmediately file a notification of such acquisitions with the department. However, if in any such acquisitions, a person not previously owning or\ncontrolling, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the shares of\nvoting stock of such terminal operator acquires shares of stock such that the\nperson owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the\nshares of voting stock of such terminal operator, such acquisition is a\ntransfer of license subject to the provisions of section\n418.6\nof this Part. (b) (1)\n\nBefore any person may be licensed as a terminal operator with the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, and at all times after the person is licensed as a\nterminal operator, such person is required to file or deposit and maintain with\nthe department: (i) a performance bond\nexecuted by a surety company which is (\na\n) authorized to\ntransact business in this State, (\nb\n) registered with and under\nthe supervision of the Insurance Department of New York State, and\n(\nc\n) approved by the Superintendent of Insurance as to solvency\nand responsibility; or\n(ii)\nsuch\nother acceptable security enumerated in section\n411.3\nof this Title (provided, however, in applying such section \"distributor\" shall\nbe read as \"terminal operator\"). Such bond or security is to secure that the\nlicensee will properly perform the duties and responsibilities of a terminal\noperator as required pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law and pursuant to\narticles 28 and 29 of the Tax Law with respect to motor fuel and rules and\nregulations promulgated thereunder and that such licensee will not suffer or\npermit any violations of such provisions of the Tax Law or rules or regulations\nor give cause for the cancellation or suspension of his license. In the case of\na terminal operator a bond to the people of the State of New York, or\nacceptable security, in the penal sum of $10,000 must be filed or deposited. Provided, however, if an applicant for a license is also registered as a\ndistributor of motor fuel and if the department believes that a possible\nrevocation of the registration as a distributor is sanction enough to secure\ncompliance with the Tax Law and rules and regulations adopted thereunder, the\ndepartment may dispense with the requirement that a bond or security be filed\nor deposited in respect of its activities as a terminal operator. (2)\n\nIf the licensee fails to\nperform the duties and responsibilities of a terminal operator required\npursuant to article 12-A and articles 28 and 29 and the rules or regulations\nrelating thereto with respect to motor fuel or suffers or permits any\nviolations of such provisions of the Tax Law or rules or regulations or gives\ncause for cancellation or suspension of its license, the department may proceed\nto cancel or suspend such license by the issuance of a notice of nonperformance\nor cause for cancellation or suspension. Such notice must specify the violation\nor violations or grounds for cancellation or suspension. The notice will be\nserved in the same manner as a notice of proposed cancellation under section\n283 (6)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsection\n411.7\nof this Title) and all the provisions of such section 283(6) with respect to a\nnotice of proposed cancellation are applicable to a notice of nonperformance or\ncause for cancellation or suspension, including opportunity for a hearing and\ntime limits with respect thereto, with such modification as may be necessary to\nadapt the language of such provision to the notice hereunder. (c) (1)\n\nWhere a person files an application for a\nlicense as a terminal operator, the Department of Taxation and Finance in\ncircumstances described herein may refuse to license such applicant and deny\nsuch application, without a prior hearing, pursuant to the provisions of this\nsubdivision.

(4)\n\nThe\ndepartment may refuse to license the applicant if a liability for the penalty\nprovided for in section\n289-b (2)\nof the Tax Law\n(see section\n416.2\nof this Title) has been finally determined to be due from an officer, director, employee or partner of such applicant or from a shareholder of the applicant\nand such penalty has not been paid in full.
