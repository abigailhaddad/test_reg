  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 432.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Article 7A of\nthe Real Property Law (sections 239 et seq.) concerns the use and sale of\nportable kerosene heaters in New York State. Section 239-b prohibits the use of\na portable kerosene heater in private dwellings and business, commercial, and\nindustrial buildings unless the heater meets the requirements of section\n239-a(7). Section 239-c prohibits the sale of portable kerosene heaters for use\nin such structures unless the heater has been approved by the Secretary of\n\nState. All unapproved portable kerosene heaters offered for sale must, pursuant\nto section 239-d, carry an identifying label. Section 239-e provides that no\nportable kerosene heater, whether or not approved, may be used in multiple\ndwellings, defined in section 239-a(2) to mean dwellings rented, leased, let, or hired out to be occupied as the residence of three or more independent\nfamilies and including dwelling portions of hospitals, nursing homes and other\ninstitutions. (b) In determining\nwhether to approve a portable kerosene heater for sale, the Secretary must\nconsider whether the heater meets the standards set out in Real Property Law\nsection 239-a(7). These require that a heater be listed and meet a series of\ntechnical standards and labeling requirements. Section 239-a(5) requires that, to be listed, a portable kerosene heater must have been tested by an\nindependent, nationally recognized testing or inspection agency acceptable to\nthe Secretary and have been determined by the agency to meet a generally\naccepted standard for such heaters. Having been listed, a portable kerosene\nheater will have met certain of the technical requirements of section 239-a(7). Designation of a testing or inspection agency as acceptable to the Secretary is\nthe subject of Part 431 of this Chapter. (c) Section 239-c further provides that the\n\nSecretary of State may promulgate additional standards required to effectuate\nthe purposes of article 7A and may by rule set forth the procedures by which\nportable kerosene heaters will be reviewed for approval. Such standards and\nprocedures are the subject of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
