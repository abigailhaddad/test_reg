Tit. 12 § 300.23 - Requirements relative to suspension or reduction of compensation benefits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In any case\nwhere the carrier or employer has made payment without waiting for an award by\nthe board, the filing of an electronic notice as prescribed in section\n300.22\n(f) of this\n\nPart is not authority to suspend or reduce payments of compensation unless\nsupporting evidence that the suspension or reduction of payment is justified is\nsubmitted in the format prescribed by the chair together with or on the same\nday as such notice. Supporting evidence may include: (1)\na copy of the payroll report if the\ncompensation rate is not based on information contained in the C-2 and is below\nthe maximum; (2)\nmedical or other\nreports (including notice of return to work) justifying the suspension or\nreduction of payments, or by indicating on such notice the name and date of the\nmedical or other reports, if they have been previously filed; or\n(3)\nproof of incarceration upon conviction of\na felony, which allows for the suspension of both wage replacement benefits and\npayment for causally related medical treatment. (b) In any case where the board has made an\naward of compensation for a temporary total or temporary partial disability at\nan established rate of compensation, and there is a direction for continuation\nof payments, the employer or carrier shall continue payments at such rate, and\nsuch payments shall not be suspended or reduced until: (1)\nthere is filed with the chair in the\ndistrict office where the case is assigned, a notice of intention to suspend or\nreduce in a format prescribed by the chair accompanied by supporting evidence\njustifying such suspension or reduction. A copy of the notice and supporting\nevidence shall be transmitted to the claimant and his or her attorney or\nlicensed representative, if any, on the same day it is submitted to the board\nor if submitted electronically within one business day of the date it is filed\nelectronically with the board; and\n(2)\nthe chair, upon receipt of above, has\nscheduled a hearing or meeting or conference on the issue within 20 days during\nany period when regular hearings or meetings or conferences are scheduled, and\nthere is a finding that such suspension or reduction is justified. At said\nhearing or meeting or conference, if either party fails to appear or fails to\nsubmit or file electronically any evidence as to the above issue, the board\nshall take such action as is appropriate under the circumstances including\ncontinuation, suspension or reduction of the award. Cases at hearing points\nwhich do not have regularly scheduled hearings or meetings or conferences\nwithin the 20 days, may be scheduled at another available hearing point. Upon a\ndetermination by the board that a suspension or reduction in payments is\njustified, the carrier, special fund or TPA shall file electronically the\nnotice prescribed in section\n300.22\n(f)(1)\nof\nthis Part; (3)\nnotwithstanding any\nprovision to the contrary in this subdivision, the employer or carrier upon the\nfiling of an electronic notice as prescribed in section\n300.22\n(f) of this\n\nPart may suspend or reduce such payments: (i) where a notice of return to work, or other written substantial legal evidence\nof claimant's return to work, has been submitted to the board in the format\nprescribed by the chair together with or on the same day that the notice to\nsuspend or reduce is electronically filed; or\n(ii)\nwhere the supporting evidence submitted\nto the board in the format prescribed by the chair together with or on the same\nday that the notice to suspend or reduce is electronically filed includes\npayroll records for at least two calendar weeks which warrant such suspension\nor reduction; or\n(iii)\nwhere the\nclaimant's medical evidence indicates that the claimant has no disability. When\nsuch medical evidence is not part of the official board file, it shall be\nsubmitted to the board in the format prescribed by the chair together with or\non the same day that the notice to suspend or reduce is electronically filed; or\n(iv)\nwhere supporting evidence\nsubmitted to the board in the format prescribed by the chair together with or\non the same day that the notice to suspend or reduce is electronically filed\nincludes proof of incarceration upon conviction of a felony. (c) (1)\n\nIn any case where the board has made an\naward for compensation for permanent total or permanent partial disability, payments shall not be suspended or modified until an application on a\nprescribed form accompanied by supporting evidence, is made to reconsider the\ndegree of impairment or wage-earning capacity; a copy of the application shall\nbe transmitted to the claimant and his or her attorney or licensed\nrepresentative, if any, on the same day it is submitted to the board or if\nsubmitted electronically within one business day of the date it is filed\nelectronically with the board; and, the board has made a final determination of\nsuch application, finding that such suspension or modification is justified; provided, however, that if such supporting evidence includes payroll records\nwhich show earnings for at least eight weeks immediately prior to the date of\nthe application which warrant modification of the rate fixed and evidence\nidentifying the claimant as the person whose payroll records are being\nsubmitted, the employer or carrier shall continue to pay compensation at such\nmodified rate as the evidence submitted indicates is proper, or may suspend\npayments if the evidence submitted supports such suspension, pending final\ndetermination of the application by the board. Upon a determination by the\nboard that a suspension or reduction in payments is justified, the carrier, special fund or TPA shall file electronically the notice prescribed in section\n300.22\n(f)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding any\nprovision to the contrary in this subdivision, the employer or carrier may, within 16 days of stopping such payments in accordance with Workers'\nCompensation Law section 25(1)(d) and upon filing electronically a notice as\nprescribed in section\n300.22\n(f) of this\n\nPart, stop, suspend or reduce such payments: (i) where supporting evidence, submitted to\nthe board in the format prescribed by the chair together with or on the same\nday as such electronic notice, includes proof of incarceration upon conviction\nof a felony; or\n(ii)\nwhere\ncompensation payable for permanent partial disability has reached the maximum\nbenefit weeks allowed pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law section 15(3)(w). In either of the above circumstances, the employer or carrier must submit an\nelectronic notice as prescribed in section\n300.22\n(f) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nPayment of\ndeath benefits shall not be suspended unless an application in the format\nprescribed by the chair is made, accompanied by supporting evidence, and the\nboard approves such suspension.

(e) In any case in which a penalty has been\nimposed arising out of the failure to make payment of compensation according to\nthe terms of the award within 10 days thereafter, the employer or his insurance\ncarrier must file notice with the chair of the payment of such penalty within\n10 days after the imposition thereof as set forth in section\n300.22\n(f)(4)\nof\nthis Part. (f) Where any notice is\nrequired to be transmitted to a claimant or his or her attorney or licensed\nrepresentative, if any, the date such notice is actually mailed or otherwise\ntransmitted shall be the date of transmittal, regardless of when received by\nthe intended recipient. (g) In the\nevent that the carrier, self-insured employer or third-party-administrator\nseeks to recover for an alleged overpayment of benefits to the claimant, such\ncarrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator must file notice to\nthe Board in the format prescribed by the Chair that identifies the amount of\nsuch overpayment. Such prescribed notice shall be due as follows: (1)\n\nWhen a request for further action is\nsubmitted to the Board by the carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator, such prescribed notice requesting recovery of an overpayment\nshall be submitted on the same day as the request for further action. (2)\n\nWhen a hearing is scheduled and the\ncarrier, self- insured employer or third-party administrator will request\nrecovery of an overpayment at the scheduled hearing, the carrier, self- insured\nemployer or third-party administrator must file the prescribed notice\nidentifying the amount of the overpayment no less than ten days before the date\nof the hearing.
