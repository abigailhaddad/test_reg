  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 60-2.2 - Omissions from the list of safe, effective and therapeutically equivalent prescription drugs\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe omission of a drug product from the list of drug products in no way automatically implies that such product is known to be therapeutically nonequivalent to other similar products nor that it is ineffective. Such omission shall indicate that an appropriate bioequivalence standard for all pharmaceutical equivalents of such drug has not yet been established, or that appropriate evidence that the standard has been met by such product has not been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n60-2.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
