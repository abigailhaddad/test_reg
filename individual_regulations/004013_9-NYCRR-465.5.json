A\npending complaint, or any part thereof, may be withdrawn by the complainant at\nany time before the service of a notice of hearing. Such a withdrawal shall be\nin writing and signed by the complainant. Such withdrawal does not preclude the\ndivision from filing a complaint on its own motion based on the same\nfacts. (b) EEOC complaints. A\ncomplaint filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on or after July\n15, 1991, to comply with the requirements of\n42 USC section\n2000e-5(c), or on or after\n\nJune 16, 1992, to comply with the requirements of\n42\nUSC section\n12117(a)\nor\n29 USC section\n633(b)\nshall not constitute\na filing within the meaning of Human Rights Law section 297.9, and shall not\nrequire a dismissal from the division where complainant seeks to pursue the\nabove remedies in court. (c) Discontinuance. (1)\n\nAfter the service of the\nnotice of hearing, a proceeding may be discontinued by the complainant on\nnotice to the respondent and with the consent of the commissioner. (2)\n\nThe application to discontinue shall be\nin writing, signed by the complainant or complainant's attorney, or made upon\nthe record at a public hearing before an administrative law judge. (d) Dismissal for lack of\njurisdiction or probable cause. (1)\n\nIf the\ndivision finds, either on the face of the complaint or after investigation, with respect to any respondent or any charge, that it lacks jurisdiction or\nthat probable cause does not exist, the complaint shall be dismissed as to such\nrespondent, or charge, by the regional director or director of regional\naffairs. (2)\nA complaint against a\nnonresident person or foreign corporation under section 298-a of the New York\n\nState Human Rights Law shall be dismissed if the division finds, either on the\nface of the complaint or after investigation, with respect to such respondent, that it lacks jurisdiction or that there is no reason to believe that such\nrespondent has committed or is about to commit outside of this State an act\nwhich, if committed within this State, would constitute an unlawful\ndiscriminatory practice. (3)\n\nThe\nregional director shall issue and serve upon all parties an order dismissing\nsaid complaint, in whole or in part, which shall state the grounds for such\ndismissal of those charges or respondents against whom the dismissal order is\ndirected, and shall contain notice to the complainant of a right to appeal to\nthe Supreme Court of the State in the judicial department embracing the county\nwherein the unlawful discriminatory practice which is the subject of the order\noccurs. (e) Dismissal\nfor administrative convenience. (1)\n\nIf the\ndivision finds that the complainant's objections to a proposed conciliation\nagreement are without substance or that noticing the complaint for hearing\nwould be otherwise undesirable, the division may, in its discretion at any time\nprior to the taking of testimony at a public hearing before an administrative\nlaw judge, dismiss the complaint on grounds of administrative\nconvenience. (2)\n\nThe grounds for\ndismissal of a complaint for administrative convenience may include, but not be\nlimited to, the following: (i) the\ncomplainant's objections to a proposed conciliation agreement are without\nsubstance; (ii)\nthe complainant is\nunavailable or unwilling to participate in conciliation or investigation, or to\nattend a hearing; (iii)\nrelief is\nprecluded by the respondent's absence or other special circumstances; (iv)\nholding a hearing will not benefit the\ncomplainant; (v) processing the\ncomplaint will not advance the State's human rights goals; or\n(vi)\nthe complainant has initiated or wants\nto initiate an action or proceeding in another forum based on the same\ngrievance, where the administrative convenience dismissal would not contravene\nthe election of remedies provisions contained in section 297.9 or section 300\nof the law. (3)\n\nThe\ndivision, by the commissioner, the deputy commissioner for regional affairs, or\nthe regional director shall issue and serve upon all parties an order\ndismissing said complaint, which shall state the grounds for such dismissal and\nshall contain notice to the complainant of a right to appeal to the Supreme\n\nCourt in the county wherein the unlawful discriminatory practice which is the\nsubject of the order occurs.
