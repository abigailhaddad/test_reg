  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 12-2.10 - Industrial products coating\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where performed. Coating shall be conducted in a ventilated hood, booth or\nenclosure complying with this Part (rule) and section 18.20 of Industrial Code\n\nPart (Rule No.) 18. (b) Vehicles. Vehicles shall not be taken into or out of spray coating spaces under their own\npower, unless the exhaust system is operating. (c) Use of different types of coating\nmaterials. Where different types of coating materials are used in the same\nbooth or space, the booth or space shall be thoroughly cleaned of previous\ncoating deposits before commencing the application of the new\nsubstance. (d) Sanding. Sanding of\nsurfaces containing lead or lead pigment shall be done either with sandpaper\nwetted with water or in an area provided with an exhaust system providing\nventilation at a minimum rate of 150 f.p.m. in the breathing zone of the\nworker. (e) Cleaning of hoods and\nbooths. Exhaust fans and the interior of hoods, booths and ducts shall be\nmaintained free of accumulations of coating material. (f) Lining of spray booths. Material for\nlining of spray booths or hoods, if used, shall cover the inner sides of the\nbooth or hood without overhanging and shall be maintained in contact with the\nwalls of the booth or hood. Loose sections shall be removed or shall be\nreapplied to the wall surface. (g) Forced drying and baking. (1)\n\nConstruction. Ovens, cabinets, other enclosures and duct work used for forced drying or\nbaking systems shall be constructed of incombustible material with expansion\njoints provided in the oven framing. Duct work shall be provided with two\ninches clearance or three-fourths inch of incombustible rigid insulation where\nthe duct work passes through combustible walls, floors or roofs. The\ntemperature of surfaces in contact with walls, floors or roofs shall not exceed\n160 degrees Fahrenheit. The floor surface of the oven shall be of incombustible\nmaterial and extend at least one foot beyond the oven outline. Interior suraces\nshall be smooth. (2)\n\nVentilation. (i) Ovens, cabinets and other enclosures used\nfor such purpose shall be provided with mechanical ventilation to maintain the\nconcentration of flammable vapors below 25 percent of the lower explosive level\nat all times. Ovens shall be exhausted mechanically so that an inward air flow\nshall be maintained through all openings to prevent escape of dangerous air\ncontaminants. The fans of such exhaust ventilating and any recirculating\nsystems shall be interlocked to the heat supply by means of approved air flow\nswitches, so that the heat supply shall be cut off unless the fan maintains the\nrequired air flow. Conveyors shall be interlocked with the oven exhaust and any\nrecirculating fans so that the conveyors cannot operate unless such fans are\noperating. (ii)\n\nWhen persons are\nrequired to enter the drying enclosure, the concentration of air contaminants\nshall be maintained below the danger level by mechanical ventilation. (3)\n\nExplosion vents. Ovens located\ninside buildings and in which flammable vapors or combustible gases may be\npresent in amounts exceeding 25 percent of the lower explosive level shall be\nequipped with explosion relief panels to relieve internal explosion pressures. Such vents shall provide an unobstructed aggregate area of one square foot of\npanel opening to each 15 cubic feet of oven volume, allowance being made for\naccess openings and doors arranged to yield easily to internal pressure. Relief\npanels shall, if practicable, be located in the top of the enclosure and be\nmade of material other than glass, which shall yield easily to internal\npressure. On long ovens, relief panels shall be distributed to provide\neffective explosion relief. Relief panels shall be located and arranged so as\nnot to create a hazard to employees or to other work spaces. Panel edges shall\nbe maintained free of condensate and other solid material to insure proper\noperation. (4)\n\nControls. (i) Fan switches shall be interlocked with\nthe fuel valve through a time delay arrangement to assure proper\npre-ventilation before the fuel is ignited. Where necessary, enclosure doors\nshall have a limit switch interlock to prevent the time delay relay from\noperating unless the enclosure doors are open. (ii)\n\nThe fuel supply line shall be provided\nwith a pressure switch to shut off the fuel supply when the fuel supply\npressure is insufficient. The switch shall not reopen the fuel valve\nautomatically. (iii)\n\nAn excess\ntemperature limit switch shall be provided to cut off the fuel supply when oven\ntemperature exceeds the safe limit. The switch shall not reopen the fuel valve\nautomatically. (iv)\n\nCombustion\nsafeguards shall be provided to shut off the fuel supply in the event of pilot\nlight or ignition failure. (5)\n\nDampers. Air supply or exhaust volume\ncontrol dampers shall be adjusted properly and fixed securely. Dampers shall be\ndesigned to prevent full closure. (6)\n\nCombination booths. Where coating and\nforced drying are done alternately in the same booth or enclosure, the\nfollowing requirements shall be complied with: (i) During coating operations, the drying\napparatus and electrical connections and wiring thereto shall not be located\nwithin the coating enclosure nor in any location where coating residue may be\ndeposited thereon. (ii)\n\nCoating\napparatus, drying apparatus and ventilating system of the coating enclosure\nshall be equipped with suitable approved interlocks so arranged that coating\napparatus cannot be operated while drying apparatus is inside the coating\nenclosure and the coating enclosure shall be purged of coating vapors for a\nperiod of not less than three minutes before drying apparatus can be energized; the ventilating system shall continue in operation during the drying process\nand in the event of failure of the ventilating system, the drying apparatus\nshall shut off automatically. (7)\n\nCleaning. The inside surfaces of the\ndrying enclosure shall be maintained clean. Cleaning tools shall be of\nnonferrous material. (h) Lighting. Illumination of hazardous areas through panels of transparent\nmaterial is permitted only under the following conditions: (1)\n\nFixed lighting units shall be used as the\nsource of illumination. (2)\n\nThe\npanel shall effectively isolate the hazardous area from the area in which the\nlighting unit is located. (3)\n\nThe\ntransparent panel shall conform to subdivision (a) of section 18.20 of\n\nIndustrial Code Part (Rule No.) 18. (4)\n\nThe installation shall be such that the\nnormal accumulation of hazardous residue on the exposed surface of the panel\nwill not be raised to a dangerous temperature by heat radiation or conduction\nfrom the source of illumination. (i) Electrostatic apparatus. (1)\n\nInstallation and use. The installation\nand use of electrostatic apparatus shall comply with other applicable\nprovisions of this Part (rule) and with the following requirements: (2)\n\nApproval required. Only approved\nelectrostatic apparatus shall be used. (3)\n\nConductive coatings. This method shall\nnot be used for spraying conductive coatings. (4)\n\nHand operations. Manually operated spray\nguns or atomizers shall not be used in an electrostatic field unless they are\napproved. (5)\n\nLocation. Electrostatic apparatus and devices used in connection with paint spraying, dipping or other coating operations shall have transformers and power packs\nlocated ouside spray booths or enclosures and areas subject to paint\ndeposit. (6)\n\nSupports. Electrodes\nand electrostatic atomizing heads shall be rigidly supported and permanently\ninstalled and shall be effectively insulated from ground. (7)\n\nClearance. Space of at least twice the\nsparking distance shall be maintained between articles being finished and\nelectrodes, electrostatic atomizing heads or conductors. (8)\n\nArticles on conveyors. Articles on\nconveyors shall be so arranged and supported as to maintain the required\nclearances. (9)\n\nAutomatic controls. Electrostatic apparatus shall be equipped with automatic controls arranged to\nmake the entire equipment dead if the ventilation of the spraying or drying\narea falls below a velocity of 100 feet per minute, or if an article on the\nconveyor projects into the required clearance, or if the conveyor\nstops. (10)\n\nGuarding and isolation\nof process. The electrical field and all parts of the equipment carrying high\npotential shall be located, guarded and fenced off to provide safe isolation of\nthe process. Guards and fences shall be of conducting material and shall be\ngrounded. (11)\n\nSigns. A suitable\nsign stating the sparking distance shall be posted conspicuously near the\nassembly. Signs designating the process zone as dangerous by reason of fire and\naccident hazard shall be posted. (12)\n\nInsulators. Insulators shall be\nacceptable to the commissioner for the potential used and shall be maintained\nclean and dry. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
