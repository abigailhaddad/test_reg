  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.6 - Setting of safety valves and safety relief valves\n\nState Regulations\n(a) One or more safety valves or safety\nrelief valves on the boiler proper shall be set at or below the maximum\nallowable working pressure. If additional valves are used the highest pressure\nsetting shall not exceed the maximum allowable working pressure by more than\nthree percent. The complete range of pressure settings of all the saturated\nsteam safety valves on a boiler shall not exceed 10 percent of the highest\npressure to which any valve is set. Pressure setting of safety relief valves on\nhigh-temperature water boilers may exceed this 10 percent range. (b) When two or more boilers which are\nallowed different pressures are connected to a common steam main, all safety\nvalves shall be set at a pressure not exceeding the lowest pressure allowed. Exception:When two or more boilers which are allowed\ndifferent pressures, are connected to a common steam main, and all safety\nvalves are not set at a pressure not exceeding the lowest pressure allowed, the\nboiler or boilers allowed the lower pressure shall each be protected by a\nsafety valve or valves placed on the connecting pipe to the steam main; the\narea or combined area of the safety valve or valves placed on the connecting\npipe to the steam main shall not be less than the area of the connecting pipe, except when the steam main is smaller than the connecting pipe, when the area\nor combined area of safety valve or valves placed in the connecting pipe shall\nnot be less than the area of the steam main. Each safety valve placed on the\nconnecting pipe shall be set at a pressure not exceeding the pressure allowed\non the boiler it protects. Exception:When two or more boilers are allowed to\noperate at different steam pressures and are connected to a common steam main\nand their respective safety valves are not set to blow off at the lowest\npressure allowed, the headers or outlets from the lower pressure boilers shall\nbe equipped with safety valves, the aggregate capacity of which shall be\nsufficient to pass the total amount of steam that can be generated in the\nhigher pressure boilers. Exception:When one or more boilers are used for reserve\npurposes only and such boilers are not operated in common with the other\nboilers, nonreturn valves of an approved type may be used in lieu of required\nsafety valves. The nonreturn valves shall be located as close as practicable to\nthe boiler with ample drain between valves. (c) Where no mechanical feed is attached to a\nboiler, the safety valve shall be set at a pressure of six percent or more\nunder the pressure of the main source of supply feeding the boiler. A return\ntrap shall not be considered as a mechanical feeding device. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
