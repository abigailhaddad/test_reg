  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 214.9 - Gaseous emissions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Coke oven\nfuel gas-sulfur recovery/desulfurization systems. No person may operate any\nby-product coke oven battery, including auxiliary gas collecting and heating\nsystems, in such a manner as to emit, burn or flare coke oven gas containing\nmore than 0.5 grains of sulfur compounds (measured as hydrogen sulfide) per dry\nstandard cubic foot of total coke oven gas produced. If the source owner can\ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner, by an acceptable air\nquality impact analysis, that the emissions will not contribute to the\ncontravention of any applicable sulfur dioxide ambient air quality standard and\nwill not significantly degrade air quality, the commissioner may permit the use\nof coke oven gas containing sulfur compounds in excess of the amount specified\nabove provided that a sulfur recovery/desulfurization system approved by the\ncommissioner is installed and operated. (b) Reasonably available control technology. (1)\n\nOwners and/or operators of facilities\nsubject to this Part must submit a compliance plan to the department by October\n20, 1994 which identifies reasonably available control technology for each\nnitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound emission point. The compliance\nplan must identify the emission points which are not equipped with reasonably\navailable control technology (RACT), and must include a schedule for\ninstallation of RACT. Reasonably available control technology as approved by\nthe department must be implemented on each emission point subject to this\nsubdivision by May 31, 1995. (2)\n\nCompliance plans which include construction of emission control equipment must\ninclude a milestone date not later than December 20, 1994 for submission to the\ndepartment of permit to construct applications. These compliance plans must\ninclude milestone dates for commencement of construction, completion of\nconstruction, and completion of emissions testing of emission control\nequipment. (3)\n\nReasonably available\ncontrol technology compliance plans for nitrogen oxide emission points must\ninclude technically feasible control strategies to minimize nitrogen oxide\nformation and emission control equipment alternatives. (4)\n\nVolatile organic compound emission points\nwhich are subject to, and are in compliance with Subparts L or FF of the\nnational emission standards for hazardous air pollutants in 40 CFR part\n61\n(see\n\nTable 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) are equipped\nwith reasonably available control technology for purposes of compliance with\nthis section. (5)\n\nThese process\nspecific RACT demonstrations which are acceptable to the department will be\nsubmitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency for approval as\na revision to the State Implementation Plan by the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n214.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
