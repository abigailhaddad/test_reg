  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 141.8 - Adm course requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Course timing. The ADM course shall\ninclude built-in timers to ensure that 320 minutes of instruction have been\nattended and completed by the student. Timers shall be built into online and\ninteractive courses in order to prevent a motorist from advancing to the next\npage or section in less than the amount of time it would take the average\nperson to read or be exposed to that page or section. Timers shall be\nincorporated into the verification process so that if a telephone verification\nsystem is used, the student cannot complete the validation piece of each\nsection until the amount of time that it would take an average person to\ncomplete such section has passed. Each sponsoring agency application, submitted in accordance\nwith section\n141.5\nof this Part, must include a\nspecific plan for how instruction time will be calculated. In addition, a\nrecord of such calculations, including all instruction time, will be recorded\nand stored by the sponsor and made available to the third party monitor and the\ndepartment for monitoring and quality control purposes. This information, as\npart of each student's completion record, must clearly differentiate actual\ninteractive instruction time from non-instruction time such as log-in\nprocedures, administrative tasks, help functions, validation processes, and\naudio/visual media download times. This information shall also be used by the\nsponsor in fulfilling its monitoring responsibilities as defined in section\n141.6\nof this Part. The sponsor\nshall store this data for a minimum of five years. (b) In-person testing alone shall not be\nsufficient proof that the motorist participated in the 320-minute\ncourse. (c) The ADM course shall\nuse the following methods to ensure that the course instructional time will\ntake 320 minutes. In order to demonstrate that the course provides sufficient\ncontent, the ADM shall use the following methods: (1)\nword count. The sponsor shall count the\ntotal number of words in the text or written sections of the course and divide\nby 100, the estimated number of words a student can read per minute. The result\nwill be total minimum time for written material; (2)\nmultimedia presentations. For\naudio/visual presentations, the total time, in minutes, it takes the multimedia\npresentations to play; (3)\ncharts\nand graphs. The ADM can allow one minute for each chart or graph; (4)\nsimulations and exercises. The calculated\ntime of simulation or exercise, allowing sufficient time for the user to follow\nalong at the required pace; (5)\npersonal and content questions. The sponsor may allow up to 45 seconds for\npersonal question responses and up to 60 seconds for content question\nresponses; and\n(6)\nsponsors can\npropose alternate time calculation methods so long as sponsors can demonstrate\nthat the course meets the 320 minute minimum requirement. (d) Customer service and support. (1)\nADM courses shall provide toll free\ntelephone lines staffed by knowledgeable customer service staff that can assist\nwith routine questions. Staff shall be knowledgeable about policy, procedural, technical and content matters. (2)\nADM courses delivered exclusively online shall also provide online assistance, in addition to telephone support, through the use of frequently asked questions\nand/or online chat access or equivalent real time communication. (3)\nADM courses delivered exclusively by\ninteractive means, other than the internet, shall also provide interactive\nassistance, in addition to telephone support, through the use of frequently\nasked questions and/or real time interactive communication. (e) Identity validation. (1)\n\nSponsors are required to validate a\nstudent's identity as part of the ADM. The specific methods chosen are based on\neach sponsors solution, and are based on points assigned to each method, as\ndetermined by the commissioner and as set forth in Appendix A (section\n141.14\nof this Part): (i) Biometrics must include methods such as\nfacial recognition, key stroke analysis, voice print or fingerprint. (ii)\n\nProctored examination after the 320\nminute course. (iii)\n\nIn person\ncontact at the time of registration or at delivery agent location for course\ndelivery. (iv)\n\nPhone contact by\npromoting students to contact sponsor during course delivery to answer personal\nor content questions. (v) Third\nparty database questions are answered by the student against a third party\ncredit bureau or government database as a means to validate identity\nonly. (vi)\n\nOnline/instant message\nby prompting student using internet or PC based training to join a discussion\ngroup or answer validation questions. (vii)\n\nPersonal questions are answered by\nstudent as a means to validate identity. (viii)\n\nContent questions are answered by\nstudent as a means to validate participation. (ix)\n\nPay per view buttons uses features of\ndigital cable TV to have a user interface for students to answer validation\nquestions during the course. (x) E-mail can be used to transmit user name and password or to provide a link to\nthe user for course access. (2)\n\nSponsors shall choose a minimum\ncombination of validation techniques (from subdivision (b) of this section) in\ndesigning their ADM course. The department, as set forth in Appendix A (section\n141.14\nof this Part), shall assign\nrelative point values to each technique to assess the security and integrity of\neach sponsor's validation solution. (3)\n\nIn the event sponsors have alternate\nvalidation techniques, DMV shall review such alternatives and determine if they\nwill be added to the list of techniques in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (f) Personal validation for purposes of identity and participation for ADM courses. (1)\n\nWhen sponsors elect to use personal\nand/or content questions as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the\nvalidation system shall incorporate the following requirements: (i) sponsors shall maintain a test bank of\nnot less than 30 personal validation questions; (ii)\nthe ADM course shall ask a minimum of 10\npersonal validation questions throughout the course. Questions shall be\ngenerated randomly from the test bank for each student and shall not be\nrepeated; (iii)\npersonal validation\nquestions will be asked throughout the course, at a minimum at the beginning of\neach session and at appropriate intervals during the course. At least one\npersonal validation question shall appear in each major unit or section, not\nincluding a final examination; and\n(iv)\nthe student must correctly answer the\npersonal validation question within 45 seconds for internet/interactive\nvalidation and 30 for telephone validation. (g) In order to ensure that a student has\nparticipated throughout the course, sponsors shall maintain a bank of 100\ncontent and environment questions relating to the material presented in each\nsection. The ADM course shall ask a minimum of 20 content and environment\nquestions throughout the course. Questions shall be generated randomly from the\ntest bank for each student. (1)\n\nThe\ncontent/environment questions shall be short answer, multiple choice, or a\ncombination of these forms. The questions shall be designed so the answer may\nnot be determined by the student without having viewed the actual material\npresented in each section or sub section. (i) The student must correctly answer the content/environment questions within 60\nseconds for internet/interactive validation and 45 seconds for telephone\nvalidation. (ii)\n\nIn no case may a\npersonal or content/environment question identify, in any way, the correct\nanswer to the question. (iii)\n\nStudents who, in their first attempt, fail to answer the minimum number of\ncontent/environment questions correctly may be asked additional questions\n(adding to the minimum time requirement) so long as they answer at least 75\npercent correctly in one of the two subsequent attempts that will be permitted\nin the internet course. If proctored testing is used, students who fail to\nanswer the minimum number of content/environment questions correctly are\nallowed one subsequent retest. Students who fail to correctly answer any\npersonal identity question in the internet course shall have one subsequent\nattempt to answer the question before being excluded from the course. The same\nstandard will apply to personal identity questions in the proctored test\nenvironment. (iv)\n\nIn such case\nwhere a student is allowed to retake any content/environment question in an\neffort to answer 75 percent of the questions correctly, the ADM course shall\npresent a different question from its test bank. (v) Students shall not be permitted to\nattempt the same question in any subsequent attempt. The ADM course may not\nrepeat a content/environment question until it has asked all the questions from\nits test bank. (vi)\n\nThe student\nshall be excluded from the course if they fail to answer at least 75 percent of\nthe content/environment questions correctly after three attempts at taking the\ntest online or two attempts at taking the proctored exam (including initial\ntest and one retest). Retests must be completed within 28 days from the initial\ncompletion of the education portion of the course. A student that has been\nexcluded from the course for failing to attain a passing score shall, in the\ndiscretion of the sponsor, be eligible to enroll in and start a new course. The\nsponsor may, in its discretion, choose to waive a fee or allow the student to\nenroll in a new course without paying an additional course fee. Students who\nhave been excluded from the course and are allowed to enroll in a new course\nmust complete the entire course. (vii)\n\nStudents shall be excluded from the\ncourse where the sponsor's DMV approved biometric identification methods cannot\nverify student identity in two attempts. Failure to confirm identity after two\nattempts shall result in the motorist being excluded from the program. If the\nidentity verification is not made due to a technology failure, the student\nshall not be excluded from the course. The sponsor shall address the technology\nfailure and allow two opportunities for biometric identity verification to be\nmade. If the identity verification is not made and the student has been\nexcluded from the class, the sponsor may, in its discretion, choose to waive\nthe course fee or allow the student to enroll in a new course without paying an\nadditional course fee. Students who have been excluded from the course and are\nallowed to enroll in a new course must complete the entire course. (2)\n\nProctored testing\nrequirements. If proctored testing is used by a sponsor as a means of\nvalidating student identity and participation, the sponsor must apply for\napproval in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. Standards may include but\nnot be limited to: (i) locations must be\napproved by the department; (ii)\nproctors must have an independent relationship with the sponsor, as well as\nthose taking the test; (iii)\nstudents must present two forms of identification, one being their NYS driver's\nlicense photo identification; (iv)\nstudents must sign in, indicating agreement with the sponsor's terms and\nconditions, including identity and participation validation questions as\noutlined in this section; and\n(v) proctors must monitor student testing in person. Testing must be completed\nwithin 30 calendar days of completing the instructional portion of the ADM\ncourse. (h) Internet/interactive delivery specific requirements. (1)\nA student receipt shall be displayed\nonline and available for printing, whether such receipt is provided at the time\nof in person registration or e-mailed to the student. The receipt is not proof\nof official course completion, which must be mailed to the student via regular\nor express mail. The receipt is only intended to show payment for course and\nmust state so. (2)\n\nStudents must\ncomplete the ADM course within 30 calendar days of registration. Students who\ndo not successfully complete the course shall be excluded from the program for\nnon-completion and shall forfeit course fees. The sponsor may, in its\ndiscretion, choose to waive a fee or allow the student to enroll in a new\ncourse without paying an additional course fee. Students who have been excluded\nfrom the course and are allowed to enroll in a new course must complete the\nentire course. (3)\n\nIn cases where\nan online course requires in-person validation and/or testing, the motorist\nmust appear and complete that requirement within 30 calendar days of completing\nthe instructional portion of the ADM course. (4)\n\nSponsors shall accommodate various\ninternet connection bandwidth rates so the program is accessible to the\ngreatest number of motorists statewide. Bandwidth and processing speed may\naffect download times for multimedia presentations. Download and processing\ntime shall not be factored into the overall minimum instruction time. (5)\n\nThe graphical interface shall be\nuser-friendly. Scrolling should be limited to up and down; students shall have\nthe ability to log on and off and navigate freely to previously viewed\nmaterial. (6)\n\nConsistent with NYS\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Web Requirements, whenever video or audio\nis playing, a text stream of the spoken word will be visible where\nappropriate. (7)\n\nEach sponsor must\noffer the ADM from a single Uniform Resource Locator (URL)/global address on\nthe worldwide web. The sponsor can accept students directed from another site, so long as it is clear on the ADM's website who the ADM sponsor is. Sub-domains\nof the ADM's registered domain may deliver content as long as the sub domain is\nregistered to and hosted by the ADM sponsor. (8)\n\nSponsors must make available printable\nfact sheets (in lieu of a workbook) that summarize key learning points from\neach module. (i) Additional requirements for video/non-interactive courses. (a) A video ADM course shall be subject to\nthe same identity and participation validation criteria required of\ninternet/interactive courses as defined in this section. (b) In addition, all ADM courses that do not\nuse the internet, or other interactive delivery and biometric identification\nvalidation will be required to include a proctored exam, in addition to the\npersonal and/or content questions asked during the course. (c) All video ADM courses will also provide a\nworkbook, or summary of key learning points from each module that the student\nwill be allowed to carry into the proctored exam. (d) A video/non-interactive ADM course is\nexempt from the 25 percent maximum timeframe for audio/visual content required\nin this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
