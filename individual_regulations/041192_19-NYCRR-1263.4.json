Due to the complex and varied nature of the actions of the\nboards of review, the code council, the department, and the secretary, the list\nin subdivision c of this section is not all inclusive. The omission from the\nlist of an action does not mean that it is exempt from this Part, nor does it\nmean that it is automatically an action requiring the preparation of an\nenvironmental impact statement. (b) The criteria set forth in 6 NYCRR section 617.7 shall be used to determine\nsignificance with respect to actions not listed in this section. (c) List.
