(b) In the instance of a\nmortgage on any property owned by a cooperative apartment corporation, no\ninterest shall be required to be paid on escrow accounts where there is a\ncontract between the mortgagor and the mortgage investing institution, entered\ninto before March 30, 1979, which contains an express disclaimer of an\nobligation on the part of the mortgage investing institution to pay interest on\nsuch accounts. (c) If a mortgage\ninvesting institution sells either a mortgage on a one- to six-family residence\noccupied by the owner and located in this State, or a mortgage on any property\nowned by a cooperative apartment corporation as defined in subdivision 12 of\nsection\n360\nof the Tax Law\n(as such subdivision was in effect on December 30, 1960), and located in this\n\nState to another mortgage investing institution (which may include a\ngovernmental or quasi- governmental agency as well as any subsequent purchaser\ntherefrom), the following principles shall apply to the payment of interest on\nescrow accounts: The mortgage investing institution which owns the mortgage\nshall be obligated to pay interest on such account, unless such institution is\nexempt from the requirement to pay interest on such account under proviso (i), (ii) or (iii) of section\n14-b\n(4)\nof the Banking Law or the provisions of\nsubdivision (b) of this section. In cases where the mortgage investing\ninstitution owning the mortgage is exempt from payment of interest on the\nescrow account by reason of section 14-b(4)(iii), then interest shall be paid\nby that mortgage investing institution which does in fact have possession of\nsuch escrow account, unless such latter institution is expressly prohibited by\nthe applicable servicing contract from earning or receiving a return from the\ninvestment of funds of such escrow account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with\nrespect to any mortgage or class of mortgages, the mortgage investing\ninstitution owning a mortgage and the mortgage investing institution having\npossession of the escrow account may by mutual agreement establish which\ninstitution shall pay interest on such account. (d) The exemption under section\n14-b\n(4)(iii)\nof the Banking Law shall apply only\nif: (1)\nthe date of the servicing contract as\nwell as the mortgage in question predate April 1, 1974; and\n(2)\nthe servicing contract expressly\nprecludes the mortgage investing institution owning such mortgage from earning\nor receiving a return from the investment of funds of such escrow accounts, or\nif the contract, though silent on the question, effectively does not permit\nsuch institution from earning or receiving such return. (e) No party acquiring a mortgage from or\nthrough a party which was not liable to pay interest on escrow accounts may\ntake advantage of a statutory exception available only to such predecessor in\ninterest.
