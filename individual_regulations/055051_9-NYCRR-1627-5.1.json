  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1627-5.1 - Rent determination\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nSection\n156\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law limits admission to persons or families whose probable\naggregate annual income does not exceed six times the annual rent in cases of\npersons or families with three or fewer dependents, and seven times the annual\nrent in cases of persons or families with four or more dependents; except that\nin the case of Vietnam veterans, their widows or families, such persons or\nfamilies shall be eligible for admission if their probable aggregate annual\nincome does not exceed seven times the annual rental (including the value or\ncost to them of heat, light, water and cooking fuel) in the case of persons or\nfamilies with three or fewer dependents, and eight times the annual rental in\nthe case of persons or families with four or more dependents. (2)\n\nAdministrative limits for continued\noccupancy will be established by the authority, subject to the approval of the\ncommissioner. Under section\n156\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law, these limits cannot exceed 50 percent of admission limits\ncurrently in effect or in effect at time of tenant's admission, whichever is\ngreater. Tenants, whose incomes increase over the admission limits, but not\nover the limits established for continued occupancy, may continue in occupancy. Their rent, however, will be increased in proportion to their ability to\npay. (b) Rent schedules. (1)\n\nRents to be assessed tenants are\ndetermined by reference to rent schedules adopted by the authority under the\nmaster management resolution. These rent schedules are known as schedule A, which lists rents based on admission incomes, and schedule B, which lists rents\nbased on continued occupancy incomes. After ascertaining gross family income, reference to schedule A or B, as applicable, will show rent to be\ncharged. (2)\n\nRent schedules are\nestablished by the authority, subject to division approval. The division will\nrender assistance in the preparation of rent schedules upon request. Such\nschedules should have as their objectives: (i) the providing of sufficient revenues which, together with State subsidy, will\nmeet the costs of efficient project operation, including reasonable reserves\nand debt payments; and\n(ii)\nthe\nestablishment of rents within the means of low income families. (c) Definition of rent\nschedule terms. (1)\n\nMinimum admission rent is\nlowest rent (including value or cost of heat, light, water and cooking fuel)\ncharged for particular type apartment. No tenant may be charged less than\nminimum. However, in some rent schedules, minimum and maximum admission rents\nare identical. (2)\n\nMaximum\nadmission rent is rent charged for particular type apartment on which maximum\nincome limits for admission are based. Applicants with income in excess of\nthese limits may not be admitted except under section\n153\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law. (3)\n\nMaximum\ncontinued occupancy rent is the highest rent which can be charged to a tenant\nwho is still eligible for continued occupancy. (4)\n\nVacating rent is that rent charged\naccording to the approved schedule to a tenant whose income exceeds the\ncontinued occupancy limit pending his removal or eviction for over-income. In\nthe event a tenant is eligible for a larger apartment because of family size or\ncomposition, he shall not be declared ineligible on the ground of excess income\nuntil his income exceeds the continued occupancy limit for the larger\napartment. Once his income exceeds the continued occupancy limit for the\napartment actually occupied, however, the rent to be charged shall be in\naccordance with the rent schedule of the larger apartment for which he is\neligible. In the event his income exceeds the continued occupancy limit of the\nlarger apartment, he is to be declared ineligible because of excess income and\nthe vacating rent to be charged shall be in accordance with the vacating rent\nschedule applicable to the larger apartment. (5)\n\nWelfare rent. Welfare rent will be the\nrent determined pursuant to the provisions of section\n1627-2.6\n(c)(5). (6)\n\nSurcharge rent refers to rent graduations\nestablished between minimum admission rent and maximum continued occupancy\nrent. These graduations, based on income, are shown in schedules A and\nB. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
