  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-10.3 - Applications for ERC approval\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section applies to applications for ERCs at sources\nsubject to Part 201 of this Title. (a) 'Application procedures'. (1)\n\nFor approval of\nERCs from a facility subject to Subpart 201-5 or 201-6 of this Title, other\nthan a facility shutdown, the facility owner or operator must submit an\napplication for a permit modification. (2)\n\nFor approval of ERCs from a registered\nfacility, other than a facility shutdown, the owner or operator must apply for\na State facility permit. (3)\n\nFor\napproval of ERCs as a result of shutdown of a facility subject to Subpart 201-5\nor 201-6 of this Title, the facility owner or operator must submit a written\nrequest to the department to discontinue the permit. (4)\n\nFor approval of ERCs as a result of\nshutdown of a registered facility, the facility owner or operator must submit a\nwritten request to the department to discontinue the\nregistration. (b) 'Application content'. A permit application involving ERCs must include the\nfollowing information: (1)\n\nThe signature of a\nresponsible official or other representative authorized to act on behalf of the\nfacility with respect to the ERCs. (2)\nA complete \"emission reduction credit\nquantification form\" with supporting documentation establishing that the\nemission reduction is surplus, quantifiable, permanent and enforceable. (i) Surplus. The applicant must demonstrate\nto the satisfaction of the department that the emission reduction for an\nemission source is in excess of any reduction required by RACT or MACT or any\nother regulations applicable to the emission source during the baseline period\nfor the emission reduction. The determination of \"surplus\" is as follows: ('a')\n\nFor an emission reduction which\nphysically occurred prior to the State or Federal register publication date\nproposing RACT, MACT, or any other applicable requirements, the applicant is\neligible for the full amount of the reduction. Otherwise, the applicant is\neligible only for the base line actual emissions reflecting RACT, MACT, or any\nother applicable emission limits. ('b')\n\nFor a future reduction as defined in\nthis Part, if the date of approval of the ERC is prior to the State or Federal\n\nRegister publication date proposing RACT, MACT, or any other applicable\nrequirements, then the applicant is eligible for the full amount of the\nreduction. Otherwise, the applicant is eligible only for the baseline actual\nemissions reflecting RACT, MACT, or any other applicable emission\nlimits. ('c')\n\nFor an emission\nsource with a source specific RACT determination, emissions in excess of the\nstatutory RACT limit shall not be considered as surplus. In those instances, the emission source's actual operating parameters shall be used in conjunction\nwith the statutory RACT limit to determine the baseline actual\nemissions. (ii)\n\nQuantifiable. The applicant must use a reliable basis for quantifying the\nreduction. Continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) data or stack test data\napproved by the department must be used if the facility is required to generate\nsuch data. Emission statements, EPA's AP-42 emission factors, and fuel and\nsolvent purchase records, with department approval, are acceptable bases for\nquantifying baseline actual emissions if an applicant demonstrates to the\ndepartment's satisfaction that CEM or stack test data are not available and\nthat CEM or stack test data was not a permit requirement. (iii)\n\nPermanent. The applicant must\ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that all emission reductions\nwill be permanent. (iv)\n\nEnforceable. ('a')\n\nFor a facility which\nsubmits a written request to the department to discontinue its permit or\nregistration (facility shutdown) pursuant to this section, no further action is\nrequired. ('b')\n\nFor an emission\nsource shutdown where the facility will continue to operate, the applicant must\napply for and obtain a permit modification in accordance with this section\nwhich reflects the permanent shutdown of the emission source through a permit\ncondition prohibiting operation of the emission source, or physically removes\nthe emission source from the permit. ('c')\n\nFor an emission source which will\ncontinue to operate at the facility, the applicant must submit for department\napproval a monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting strategy that will be used\nto demonstrate that the emission reductions are verifiable. If approvable, the\ndepartment will include terms and conditions in the operating permit which\nimplement the applicant's strategy. If the department determines the strategy\nis in complete or otherwise not approvable, the department may propose terms\nand conditions for the permit or as part of a proposed single source SIP\nrevision as appropriate to ensure that the emission reductions are\nverifiable. ('d')\n\nAny permit\nmodification must be processed in accordance with this\n\nSubpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
