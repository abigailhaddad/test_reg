  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 223.9 - Monitoring of confined process emissions and operations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any source owner subject to the\nprovisions of this Part shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate a\ncontinuous emission monitoring system for: (1)\nthe measurement of opacity of emissions\nfrom each fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator; (2)\ncontinuously monitoring and recording the\nconcentration of carbon monoxide in emissions to the outdoor atmosphere from\nany new fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator. An instrument with\na span of 1000 ppm shall be used; (3)\nthe measurement of sulfur dioxide in the\nemissions to the outdoor atmosphere from the combustion of fuel gases, except\nwhere a continuous monitoring system is used for monitoring and recording the\nconcentration of hydrogen sulfide in the fuel gas at any fuel gas combustion\ndevice. Fuel gas combustion devices having a common source of fuel gas may be\nmonitored in one location; (4)\ncontinuously monitoring and recording concentrations of sulfer dioxide in the\nemissions to the outdoor atmosphere from any new Claus sulfur recovery plant\nwhere compliance is achieved by burning of the tail gases; or continuously\nmonitoring and recording concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and reduced sulfur\ncompounds in the emissions to the outdoor atmosphere from any Claus sulfur\nrecovery plant if compliance is achieved through the use of a reduction control\nsystem not followed by an afterburner. (b) The average coke burn-off rate (thousands\nof kilograms/hr) and hours of operation for any fluid catalytic cracking unit\ncatalyst regenerator subject to sections\n223.3\n(b) and\n223.5\n(b) of this\n\nPart shall be recorded daily. (c) The source owner shall record daily the combustion rates of liquid or solid\nfossil fuels (liters/hr or kilograms/hr) and the hours of operation during\nwhich liquid or solid fossil fuels are combusted in the incinerator - waste\nheat boiler for any fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator subject\nto section\n223.3\n(b) of this\n\nPart and which utilizes an incinerator - waste heat boiler to combust the\nexhaust gases from the catalyst regenerator. (d) Any person subject to the provisions of\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section shall maintain a file of the required\nmeasurements tabulated in a format acceptable to the commissioner. (e) Such records of measurements shall be\nretained for a minimum of three years, and shall be furnished to the\ncommissioner on his request. (f) Any\nperson subject to the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section shall\nsubmit a written report, at the request of the commissioner, of excess\nemissions of opacity and sulfur dioxide for each calendar quarter, and the\nnature and cause of the excessive emissions if known. For opacity measurements, the excess emissions report shall consist of the magnitude, in percent opacity, of all six-minute averages of opacity greater than the opacity standards in\nthis Part for each hour of operation. For sulfur dioxide measurements, the\nexcess emissions report shall include any six-hour period in which the average\nemissions (arithmetic average of six continuous one-hour periods) of sulfur\ndioxide exceed the standard under paragraphs (b)(2)-(3) of section\n223.6\nof this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n223.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
