Each wager\nof a player shall be determined individually, and shall win if the: (i) point count of the player is 21 or less\nand the point count of the dealer exceeds 22; (ii)\npoint count of the player exceeds that\nof the dealer without either exceeding 21; or\n(iii)\nplayer has a blackjack without\nswitching cards and the dealer does not also have blackjack. (2)\n\nExcept as provided in\nsubparagraph (iii) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, if the point count of\nthe player is the same as the dealer, a wager made in accordance with this\nsection shall be a push, unless the player has a point count: (i) of 21 in more than two cards and the\ndealer has a blackjack, in which case the wager shall lose; or\n(ii)\nexceeding 21, in which case the wager\nshall lose. (3)\n\nIf the\npoint count of the dealer is 22 and the point count of the player is 21 or\nless, a wager made in accordance with this section shall be a push unless the\nplayer has a blackjack without switching cards pursuant to subparagraph (iii)\nof paragraph (1) of this subdivision, in which case the wager shall\nwin.

(5)\n\nOnce the first card of\nany round of play has been removed from the shoe by the dealer, no player shall\nmake, alter, remove, or otherwise handle any wager that has been made until a\ndecision has been rendered and implemented with respect to that wager, except\nas permitted in this section. (6)\n\nOnce an insurance wager or a wager to double down has been made by a player and\nconfirmed by the dealer, no player shall alter, remove or otherwise handle the\nwager until a decision has been rendered and implemented with respect to that\nwager. (7)\n\nAfter each round of play\nis complete, the dealer shall collect all losing wagers, return any pushes and\npay all winning wagers. Except as provided in subdivisions (f) and (h) of this\nsection, all winning blackjack switch wagers, including a blackjack, shall be\npaid at no less than odds of 1:1. (8)\n\nAfter the cards have been shuffled, a\ngaming facility may prohibit any person, whether seated at the gaming table or\nnot, who does not make a wager on a given round of play from placing a wager on\nthe next round of play and any subsequent round of play at that gaming table\nuntil a re-shuffle of the cards has occurred. (d) Procedure for dealing the cards. (1)\n\nAll cards used in blackjack switch shall\nbe dealt from a dealing shoe specifically designed for such purpose. (2)\n\nThe dealer shall remove cards from the\nshoe with the dealer's left hand, turn the cards face up, and then place the\ncards on the appropriate area of the layout with the dealer's right hand, except that the dealer has the option to deal cards to the first two betting\nspots with the dealer's left hand. (3)\n\nAfter each full set of cards is placed in\nthe shoe, the dealer shall burn the first card from the shoe. Each new dealer\nwho comes to the table also shall burn the first card from the shoe before the\nnew dealer deals any cards to the players. The burn card shall be disclosed if\nrequested by a player. (4)\n\nAt the\ncommencement of each round of play, the dealer shall, starting on the dealer's\nleft and continuing around the table, deal the cards in the following order: (i) one card face up to each box on the\nlayout in which a wager is contained; (ii)\none card face up to the\ndealer; (iii)\na second card face up\nto each box in which a wager is contained, which card shall be dealt so as to\noverlap the lower left-hand corner of the first card, as seen from the dealer's\npoint of view; and\n(iv)\none card\nface down to the dealer. (5)\n\nImmediately after the first four cards\nare dealt to each player, and before any card reader device is used and any\nadditional cards are dealt to any player or the dealer, the dealer shall\ncollect all losing match wagers and pay all winning match wagers in accordance\nwith subdivision (e) of this section. (6)\n\nAfter all match wagers have been settled, if the dealer's first card is an ace, king, queen, jack or 10, each player may\nmake an insurance wager and the insurance wager shall be settled pursuant to\nsubdivision (e) of section\n5324.10\nof this Part. The dealer\nshall determine whether the hole card will give the dealer a natural blackjack\nprior to dealing any additional cards to the players at the table: (i) if the gaming facility elects to use a\ncard reader device, the dealer shall insert the hole card into the card reader\ndevice by moving the card face down on the layout without exposing its value to\nanyone at the table, including the dealer. If the dealer has a natural\nblackjack, no additional cards shall be dealt and each player's wager shall be\nsettled; and\n(ii)\nif the gaming\nfacility elects not to use a card reader device, the dealer shall determine the\nvalue of the hole card by discreetly peeking at the card without exposing its\nvalue to any other person. If the dealer has a natural blackjack, no additional\ncards shall be dealt and each player's wager shall be settled. (7)\n\nAfter all insurance wagers\nhave been settled, the dealer shall, beginning from the dealer's left, announce\nthe point total of the first hand of each player, and ask if the player wishes\nto switch. (i) If the player decides to\nswitch, the dealer shall exchange the second cards dealt to the two hands of\nthat player with each other, and then announce the new point total of each\nhand. (ii)\nA player who has\nswitched cards pursuant to this subdivision may revoke the decision and request\nthe dealer to return the cards to their original positions, provided that no\nadditional cards have yet been dealt to either of the player's hands or to the\ndealer. (iii)\n\nOther than a return\nof the cards to their original positions pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph, a player shall be permitted only one switch of cards per hand in\neach round of play. (8)\n\nAfter the player has been offered a switch and has either declined or obtained\nthe switch, the player shall, for the first of the player's two hands, indicate\nwhether the player wishes to stand, draw, surrender, double down or split pairs\npursuant to section\n5324.10\nof this Part. (9)\n\nAs the player indicates decisions as to\nthe first hand, the dealer shall deal face up whatever additional cards are\nnecessary to effectuate such decisions consistent with this section and shall\nannounce the new point total of that hand after each additional card is\ndealt. (10)\n\nAfter the player\ncompletes decisions as to the first hand, the procedures in paragraphs (8) and\n(9) of this subdivision shall be repeated for the second hand of such\nplayer. (11)\n\nAfter the player has\ncompleted the decisions for both hands, the procedures in paragraphs (8)\nthrough (10) of this subdivision shall be repeated for the player to the\ndealer's right of that player at the table. (12)\n\nAfter the decision of each player has\nbeen implemented and all additional cards have been dealt, the dealer shall\nexpose the dealer's hole card. Any additional cards required to be dealt to the\nhand of the dealer shall be dealt face up. After the dealer's hand has been\ncompleted, the dealer shall announce the point count. A gaming facility may\npermit the dealer to deal, after the decisions of each player have been\nimplemented and all additional player cards have been dealt, a second card face\nup to the dealer (the hole card); provided, however, that such card shall not\nbe removed from the dealing shoe until the dealer has first announced \"dealer's\ncard.\" Any additional cards authorized to be dealt to the hand of the dealer by\nsubdivision (k) of this section shall be dealt face up at this time, after\nwhich the dealer shall announce the total point count for the hand of the\ndealer. (e) Match wager. (1)\nA player at a blackjack switch table may\nmake an additional optional wager, known as a match wager, that two or more of\nthe initial four cards dealt to that player will form one of the following\nauthorized matches: (i) one pair, or a pair, is a hand consisting of two cards of the same rank, regardless of\nsuit; (ii)\ntwo pairs is a hand\nconsisting of two pairs; (iii)\nthree of a kind is a hand consisting of three cards of the same rank, without\nregard to suit; and\n(iv)\nfour of a\nkind is a hand consisting of four cards of the same rank, without regard to\nsuit. (2)\n\nPrior to the\nfirst card being dealt for each round of play, any player who has placed the\ntwo blackjack wagers required by this subdivision may make a match wager by\nplacing chips or plaques on the appropriate designated betting area of the\nlayout, and in an amount that shall equal or exceed the posted minimum wager\nfor a match wager at that table. (3)\nA gaming facility shall pay winning match\nwagers at no less than the amounts listed in the following pay table: Match type\n\nSix-deck game\n\nEiqht-deck game\n\nOne pair\n1:1\n1:1\n\nThree of a kind\n5:1\n5:1\n\nTwo pair\n8:1\n7:1\n\nFour of a kind\n40:1\n50:1\n(4)\n\nIf more than one type of match occurs in\na player's initial four cards, the match wager shall be paid only once, using\nthe highest payoff occurring within those cards.
