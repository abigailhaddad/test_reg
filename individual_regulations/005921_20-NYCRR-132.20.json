  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 132.20 - Pensions and other retirement benefits\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf a pension or other retirement benefit does not\nqualify as an annuity under section\n132.4\n(d) of this Part, and is attributable to services performed wholly within New York\n\nState, the entire amount included in the individual's Federal adjusted gross\nincome is likewise includible in his New York adjusted gross income. If the\npension or other retirement benefit is attributable to services performed\nwholly outside New York State, no part of the amount received is includible in\nthe individual's New York adjusted gross income. Where the employee's services\nwere performed partly within and partly without New York State, the amount\nincludible in the individual's New York adjusted gross income is the proportion\nof the amount included in the individual's Federal adjusted gross income which\nthe total compensation, received from the employer for the services performed\nin New York State during a period consisting of the portion of the taxable year\nprior to retirement and the three taxable years immediately preceding the\nretirement, bears to the total compensation received from the employer during\nsuch period for services performed both within and without New York State. For\npurposes of this section, the compensation for services performed within New\n\nYork State must be determined separately for each taxable year or portion of a\nyear in accordance with the applicable provisions of section\n132.17, 132.18\nor\n132.19\nof this Part. A determination of the portion of a pension or other form of\ndeferred compensation attributable to New York State on the basis of a period\nof time greater than the period referred to above may be made if the individual\nestablishes, to the satisfaction of the Tax Commission, the amount of his total\nyearly compensation for a longer period of time and the amount allocable to New\n\nYork State in each year in accordance with the applicable provisions of\nsections\n132.17\nthrough\n132.19\nof this Part. (For taxability of pensions and other retirement benefits in\ngeneral, see section\n132.4\n[d]\nof this Part.)\n\nExample: A, a nonresident of New York State, performs services\nboth within and without New York State for a corporate employer under an\nemployment contract whereby for each year's services he is to receive a salary\nof $40,000 during the period of employment and an additional $100,000 payable\nin 10 equal annual installments commencing after his employment terminates. A\nterminates his employment on July 1, 1977, when he is 50 years of age and his\nlife expectancy is 25.5 years. Since the payments are not to run for at least\none half of A's life expectancy, they do not qualify as an annuity under\nsection\n132.4\n(d) of this Part. Assuming that the New York State percentages for allocating his\nsalary were 50 percent for 1974, 60 percent for 1975, 75 percent for 1976, and\n40 percent for the first half of 1977, the portion of additional payments to be\nincluded in New York adjusted gross income would be computed as follows: Total\ncompensation\n\nNew York\nportion\n1974\n$ 40,000\n(50%)\n$20,000\n1975\n40,000\n(60%)\n24,000\n1976\n40,000\n(75%)\n30,000\n1977 (6 months)\n20,000\n(40%)\n8,000\n\nTotals\n$140,000\n$82,000\n$82,000\n/\n$140,000\n× $10,000 = $5,857.14 includible annually in A's New York adjusted gross\nincome.
