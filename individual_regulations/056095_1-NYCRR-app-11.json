Cleaning of Evaporators and Condensers\n\nSome evaporators are designed to that the product is exposed to\nlarge surface areas for a long period of time at temperatures conducive to the\ngrowth of micro-organisms. Pipelines and/or equipment designed for automated mechanical\ncleaning of evaporators should meet the following requirements: 1. A pH recording device should be installed in the return\nsolution line to record the pH and time which the line or equipment is exposed\nduring the cleaning and sanitizing operation. 2. These pH recording charts should be identified, dated, and\nretained for 3 months. 3. During each official inspection the regulatory agency should\nexamine and initial the pH recording charts to verify the time of exposure to\nthe cleaning solutions and their pH. The following are suggested procedures for cleaning and\nsanitizing evaporators and condensers: The surface area inside an evaporator is extremely large. Not\nonly is there a large separator chamber and vapor lines but steam chests may\nalso have as many as 500 heating tubes from 8 to 10 feet long. The total\nsurface area may be 3000 to 4000 square feet which may require large volumes\nfor recirculation. This surface area must be cleaned and sanitized carefully or\nit will contaminate the product. The operating temperatures in an evaporator\nare very close to the growing temperatures of thermoduric and certain\nmesophyllic types of bacteria. The first effect may operate at 140°F to 170°F\n(60°C to 77°C) the second effect at 125°F to 145°F (52°C to 63°C), and the\nthird effect at 100°F to 120°F (38°C to 49°C). The product being evaporated is\noften recirculated in the last effect several times until the right\nconcentration is reached which may give bacteria ample time to grow. A clean\nevaporator operates more efficiently. It is necessary to clean the evaporators\nafter long periods of operations because burned-on material reduces heat\ntransfer and efficiency. A point is reached where it will be more economical to\nstop and clean up than to continue to operate. Evaporators need cleaning for\nsanitary reasons as well as for efficient operation. Tube chests and heating\nplates must be cleaned to get good heat transfer. If vapor lines are not\ncleaned, it is possible to get a back surge of vapor when the vacuum is\nreleased. This can carry soil back into the product thus lowering the quality. This soil may drop into the thermo-compression unit, block passage of vapors\nand actually prevent good operation. Compounds for cleaning are usually divided\ninto two main groups: 1. The alkaline cleaners usually contain caustic with water\nconditioners, synthetic detergents and foam depressants added to enchance\ncleaning action. The purpose of the alkaline cleaner is to digest the bulk of\nthe soil. The alkaline solutions are usually run first at concentrations\nranging from 1 percent to 3 percent at temperatures of 180°F to 190°F (83°C to\n88°C) for 30 to 60 minutes. 2. Acid cleaners are usually food grade with synthetic\ndetergents and inhibitors to prevent attack on metal surfaces. The purpose of\nacid cleaners is to remove mineral films, alkali cleaner residues, and shine\nthe inside surfaces. Acid solutions are usually used last at concentrations of\n0.2 percent to 0.5 percent at 140°F to 160°F (60°C to 71°C) In all cases\ncleaners and cleaning instructions should be followed as recommended by the\nmanufacturer of cleaning compounds. It is also necessary to follow the\nrecommendations and instructions of evaporator manufacturers. The evaporators\noperating with compressed ammonia require special cleaning precautions. Cleaning Methods. -There are three basic methods of\ncleaning evaporators: boil-out; circulation; spray cleaning; or a combination\nof the three methods. The boil-out method is the oldest but it is still very\neffective. It is accomplished by rolling or boiling the cleaning solution under\npartial vacuum. Heat is applied by the evaporator and just enough vacuum is\nused to roll the solution. Cleaning solutions are elevated to the dome and\nupper parts by opening and closing the vacuum breaker. Hand brushing of some\nareas is often necessary following boil-out because it is difficult to\nthoroughly clean the upper surfaces with this method. Circulation cleaning is a newer method of cleaning. The\ncleaning solution actually follows the product path. The solution is circulated\nby returning it back to the starting point. Heat is applied by a pre-heater, tube chest, or steam jet, sometimes called a boil-out nozzle. This method is\nnot adaptable to all types of evaporators and it is usually necessary to add\nspray cleaning devices to thoroughly clean separators and the bottom tube sheet\nin steam chests. Spray cleaning is the newest method of cleaning evaporators. Cleaning solutions are pumped through spray devices and distributed over the\nsurfaces which are contacted by the product. Heat is applied by pre-heater, a\nsurge tank, or on the run with live steam. When properly designed and operated\nspray cleaning systems are used, cleaning problems are at a minimum. Spray\ncleaning offers many advantages over boil-out or circulation methods of\ncleaning. Less water and less cleaning solution is required. This not only\nresults in a saving of water, heat and cleaners, but more concentrated cleaning\nsolutions can be used giving faster, more effective cleaning. Heat for the\nrinse water and cleaning solutions is applied externally, preventing additional\nburn-on in tube chests. As the evaporator is not under vacuum, less heat is\nrequired to keep solution hot, resulting in a saving of fuel. Higher\ntemperatures can be used to improve cleaning efficiency. There are some\ndisadvantages to spray cleaning. Spray devices cost extra money because they\nare specifically designed for almost every operation. Spray devices must be\nproperly placed and designed to cover the top of the dome in the separator, the\ntangential inlets, the vapor lines, sight glasses, and steam chest tubes. Spray\ncleaning may require additional stainless steel lines to convey the solution at\nthe necessary volumes. Larger pumps are also required to pump the necessary\nvolume of cleaning solution. Even with these disadvantages, the advantages of\nsavings in heat, water, cleaning compound and time outweigh the disadvantages. Sometimes there are advantages in using combined systems of cleaning. It may be\npossible to boil out the steam chests and spray the separators. Sometimes it is\npossible to circulate the steam chests and spray clean the separators or other\nportions of the unit. Quite often the combined systems, especially the\ncirculation in the spray system, will work best on certain types of\nevaporators. One of the biggest factors affecting the method of cleaning\nused is the type of evaporator. In a falling film type, circulation cleaning\ncan be used to clean the tube chests and spray cleaning can be utilized to\nclean the evaporator chambers. When using a plate-type, circulation cleaning is\nbest. In an internal type tube chest, a boil-out system for the tubes and spray\ncleaning of the separator works very well. With an external cheat type, the\nentire unit can be spray cleaned. If it is a compressed ammonia operated\nevaporator, spray cleaning works well. Sanitizing should be done to eliminate\nany microorganisms which may have survived the cleaning regimen. Sanitizing can\nbest be accomplished by using chemical sanitizers. Heat may be used if all\nsurfaces are heated to 180°F (83°C) or higher. Since there is a tremendous\ninvestment in stainless steel evaporators, it is necessary to use a product\nwhich does not corrode stainless steel. Chemical sanitizers can be applied\nthrough the spray equipment or they can be applied with fogging guns. II. High Pressure Pump and High Pressure\n\nLines\n\nThe high pressure pump and high pressure line to the dryer\nnozzles may be cleaned as a separate circuit by connecting the line to the\nnozzle back to the drop tank and this tank connecting to the inlet of the high\npressure pump. The regular product atomizing nozzles should be removed before\ncleaning is to be done. Another method of cleaning the high pressure pump and lines is\nto include this pump and high pressure lines in the circuit when wet cleaning\nof some types of spray dryers. In either case a solution of 1 to 3 percent\ncaustic heated to 160°F (72°C) should be circulated for at least 30 minutes. A\nsolution of inhibited acid should be pumped through the atomizing system as a\ndaily procedure to remove the milkstone from the high pressure pump and high\npressure line. The solution of inhibited acid should be recirculated a minimum\nof 10 to 15 minutes and followed by a rinse with potable water. It is also recommended that the high pressure pump head be\ndisassembled as a daily procedure immediately following the final rinse and the\nparts be placed on a table or rack for air drying. When the pump is\ndisassembled the parts are to be checked to see if they are clean, and to see\nif any maintenance is required to remove pits; seats are also checked at this\ntime. Since a high pressure pump is subjected daily to extreme heavy duty, the\nvalves and seats are recommended to be ground periodically to maintain uniform\npressure on the atomizing nozzles. Prior to use, the entire system should be\nsanitized. III. Wet Cleaning of Dryers\n\nThere are several methods of wet cleaning dryers. The first\nmethod is hand brushing. The operators get into the dryer with buckets of\ncleaning solution and brush all surfaces of the dryer. The unit is then rinsed\nwith a hose. Cleaning can also be done with hand operated spray guns. These\nspray guns are pressure pumps which operate at high pressures in low volumes; in many cases, box type dryers can be completely cleaned with the addition of a\nseven-foot extension on these pressure guns. By using high pressure spray guns\nand cleaning compounds with a high synthetic detergent content, it is possible\nto remove very difficult soil. The third method of wet cleaning is by spray\ncleaning with various types of stationary or rotating spray devices. They\nusually operate at a high volume of low pressure in the range of 10 to 20 psi. Constant spray coverage can be obtained when spray devices are properly\ndesigned. Usually several spray devices are required because of the many\nchambers, collectors, and down pipes within these units. Less time is required\nto do a complete job with spray cleaning. The systems are installed so that\ncleaning lines are easily connected to the spray devices and an effective\nreturn system. Spray cleaning time is much shorter than hand cleaning time, especially in large units. Spray cleaning eliminates the entry of men into the\ndrying units. Silo or vertical type dryers are often 20 to 50 feet high and it\nis difficult and dangerous to clean by hand or by hand operated units. Spray\ncleaning eliminates the flavor contamination when switching to other products. If an ungraded product is run through the dryer, it is necessary to thoroughly\nclean before running a product like Grade A nonfat powder. There are\ndisadvantages to spray cleaning. The spray devices must be properly placed and\ndesigned to do the complete cleaning job. They must be removable so as not to\naffect the air currents during operation. However, the advantages of safety\nplus cleaning time and consistently complete cleaning outweigh the\ndisadvantages. A typical spray cleaning cycle might operate as follows: The various spray heads are placed in the dryer and securely\nfastened into place. The rinse water is pumped through the spray device and\nallowed to run down the side walls of the drying units. Cleaning compounds\nwhich are mild alkalis or chlorinated cleaned-in-place cleaners are prepared at\n0.3 to 1 percent concentration heated to 160 to 180F (71 to 83C), and\ncirculated for 45 minutes to 1 hour. The unit is given a final rinse and is\nthoroughly dried. Occasionally acid type cleaners are used to control mineral\nfilms. Sanitizing with chemical sanitizers is a controversial subject. Sanitizing can be done with heat but it may be difficult to heat all surfaces\nto 180°F (83°C). Heating to 180°F (83°C) for 10 minutes does not kill spore\nformers. However, they are killed with many chemical sanitizers. Even if heat\nis used, it is recommended that chemical sanitizers be occasionally used. By\npumping the sanitizer solution to the high pressure pump or by fogging with\nhigh pressure, it is possible to completely cover the product-contact surface. Actually, the unit must be thoroughly dried before operation. Chlorine\nsanitizers may cause corrosion. Obviously, these compounds should be used with\ncare. If chlorine is left on the dryer and heat is applied, the chlorine\ndroplets will become hot and concentrate and cause pitting. When chlorinated\ncleaners are used, a dryer surface can be effectively cleaned and at least\npartially sanitized and the solution can be completely rinsed. Acid-synthetic\ndetergent type sanitizers have been developed which are effective on spore\nformers. These compounds are germicidal, effective in hard water and stable in\nhot or cold solutions. They have an advantage in that they are noncorrosive to\ndairy metal. It is not necessary to wet clean dryers on a daily basis. However, a schedule should be set up so cleaning is done periodically. As long as a\ndryer is operating continuously, it is not necessary to clean it from an\nefficiency standpoint. Some types of dryers require very little cleaning, maybe\nonce each month; others require dry cleaning on a more frequent basis. It is\nnecessary to clean and sanitize dryers if they are going to remain idle any\nappreciable length of time. Bacteria may grow in dryers which remain idle. Dryers must be spray cleaned if they are improperly operated, causing burn-on\nin the drying chamber. Whenever fires develop inside the drying unit or when\nburn-on occurs, it is necessary to thoroughly clean at least the drying\nchambers. Quality is the key to the dry milk industry. There should be a\nprogram of cleaning and sanitizing of both evaporators and dryers. Better\nquality products are produced in evaporators and dryers when thoroughly cleaned\nand sanitized on a regular basis. IV. Dry Cleaning\n\nIt is very difficult to discuss proper cleaning procedures\nwithout also discussing proper operating procedures, especially the start up\nand shutdown of the dryer. Assuming the dryer has been properly started and\noperated throughout the run or drying cycle, the first step in a successful\ncleaning operation is shutting the dryer down properly. The type of energy\nsupplying heat to the dryer chamber, i.e., steam or gas, alters the proper\nshutdown technique. The correct procedure in shutting down a steam heated dryer\nis as follows: 1. Shut off the main steam valve at the proper time. 2. Maintain proper dryer outlet temperature for drying by\ngradually reducing the output of the high pressure pump until the residual heat\nof the steam coil is dissipated to a point where it does not maintain proper\ntemperature or until the product being pumped by the high pressure pump does\nnot maintain a satisfactory spray pattern. 3. Keep product removal system and conveying system in\noperation. 4. Keep air intake and exhaust fans on dryer in operation until\nmain chamber is sufficiently cooled to provide a comfortable atmosphere for the\ncleanup crew. On a gas-fired spray dryer, the burner assembly has very little\nor no residual heat capacity. Therefore, the shutdown is more rapid. The\ncorrect procedure for shutting down a gas-fired dryer is as follows: 1. Shut off gas supply to burner. 2. Immediately shut off high pressure pump. 3. Same procedure as steam heated dryer. 4. Same procedure as steam heated dryer. After the above procedures have been accomplished, shut down\nthe intake fan. Let exhaust fan and vibrators or shakers continue to operate, also product removal system. The exhaust fan should be severely dampered so\nthat it induces only a small air flow. A small auxiliary fan is sometimes used\nin lieu of the dampered exhaust fan. The use of either fan serves a twofold\npurpose: first, it is helpful to put the drying system under a slight negative\npressure to reduce the tendency for product to drift out of the system into the\nplant through open doors, etc. Secondly, it is vital to prevent thermal\ncurrents from creating a reverse air flow through the drying system, which\ntends to deposit product on the heating surfaces and plenum duct. Product\ndeposits on steam coils reduce their heating ability, create sediment and\nconceivably bacterial problem areas. If the dryer is gas fired, there is a\nfurther hazard of fire. It is important, therefore, that the closure or covers\nsupplied by the manufacturer be placed on the inlet air duct system\nsimultaneously with the shutdown of the fan. After any prime product has been\nremoved from the drying system and the sifter operator notified, the system is\nready for cleaning. The cleanup crew should be supplied each day with a freshly\nlaundered set of coveralls, white cap, white face mask, and clean rubbers or\nboot covers (canvas, or single-service plastic). Prior to donning the above\nuniform, the procedure is to remove the spray nozzles and pipes as these are\nnormally cleaned with the liquid dryer feed equipment. With clean uniforms, proper brushes and preferably vacuum cleaning equipment, they enter the main\ndesiccator chamber and start the cleaning process as far upstream as possible\nfrom the powder removal or pneumatic conveyor system. 1. The first portion cleaned is the collector system. This is\ndone by inserting a brush into the cloth tubes and brushing the length of the\ntube. Again, this can be done more satisfactorily by utilizing the special\nvacuum tools designed and available for this service. 2. Remove dustcovers and brush or vacuum out nozzle\nports. 3. Manually brush or vacuum ceiling and walls of drying\nchamber. 4. Sweep or vacuum clean floor of the dryer, placing product in\na container. Note.--Do not remove this product by way of product removal\nsystem. 5. Inspect dryer for any inadvertent wet spraying or nozzle\ndrippings that may have occurred during the drying cycle. Should either of\nthese have occurred, the application of a minimum amount of water and effort\nwill be required to remove the clinging material. Any moisture introduced must\nbe removed before operation because of its effect upon smooth product flow and\nbecause it would establish a more favorable environment for bacterial growth if\nit were allowed to remain. 6. Check collector for loose or torn bags and any other\nmechanical checks necessary before leaving the dryer. 7. Close dryer securely and check switches to make sure they\nare in the proper starting positions. At frequent intervals, not over a\ntwo-week period, the operator should clean and inspect the heated air intakes\nof the dryer, assuming that the dryer is properly operated during this time. However, should a malfunction occur where the dryer operator does not follow\nthe procedures outlined for proper shutdown, it may require inspection and\ncleaning at closer intervals. Frequent inspection will eliminate a source of\nsediment contamination. 8. On startup after dry cleaning of the cloth collector dryer, the first two bags of product shall be discarded. This will allow for the\nremoval of any product remaining in the tubes and system after shutdown. V. Auxiliary Dry Product Equipment\n\nPart A. Sifters\n\nIn general, there are two types of dry product sifters in\nuse by the dry milk manufacturing industry. These are the shaker type and the\nrotary or gyrating type. Both are designed to operate at various capacities\neither manually bagging or packaging from their outlet or designed for\nautomatic packaging equipment. For the general guidance of sifter manufacturers and the dry\nmilk industry, the following screen size openings may be considered as\nrecommended openings to result in satisfactory screening of the listed dry\nproducts: TABLE 3\n\nSieve\ndesignation\n\nMaximum sieve\nopening\n\nProduct\n(from ASTM\n223.1)\n(approx.)\nmm. inch\n\nNonfat dry milk....... #25\n0.707\n0.027\n\nDry whole and dry buttermilk....... #16\n1.19\n0.045\n\nIt is recognized that larger screen size openings may be\nnecessary for sifting certain special dry products (such as \"instant\" products)\nand for classification of products into different particle sizes. Openings referred to above are based on general experience as\nto what constitutes satisfactory screening to remove product lumps or potential\nproduct contamination, and also on ability of most currently used sifters to\nsuccessfully sift dry products through such size openings without excessive\nloss of fine product into the \"reject material\" outlet. (Other factors also\naffect loss, such as: percent of \"open area\" in screen used; uneven flow rates\nto the sifter; ratio of screening surface to dryer capacity; amount and kind of\nmechanical energy applied to the screening surface; sifter design and\nconstruction; and nature of dry product being sifted.)\n\nScreen opening dimensions may be obtained by any desired\ncombination of wire thickness and number of wires per inch. For instance, if\nthe screening surface is made of stainless steel woven wire, the 0.027 inch\nopening might be obtained by using 24 X 24 mesh market grade screen cloth made\nof wire 0.014 inch thick (about 45 percent open area) or by using 30 X 30\nbolting cloth screen made of wire 0.0065 inch (about 65 percent open area) or\nby many other mesh-wire thickness combinations. These combinations allow a wide\nchoice to obtain desired balance between screen strength and percent open area. If materials other than stainless steel are used to construct the screening\nsurface, similar combinations may be employed to achieve desired opening\nsize. Recommendations for Cleaning Dry Product\n\nSifters\n1. Dry cleaning program. -The procedures set forth\nbelow should be followed. a. Completely dismantle and thoroughly vacuum or dry brush\nclean all product-contact surfaces of the dry milk sifter. Reassemble as soon\nas finished and make every effort to keep all parts dry. b. Check sifter screen(s) for broken or displaced wires\n(threads) and for other openings around the frame of the screen, which might\npermit the passage of unsifted product. Other parts of the sifter, including\nball trays and balls, if used, should also be inspected for condition. Any\nnecessary repair or replacement should be made as soon as possible. c. Flexible rubber or cloth connectors at the inlet and outlets\nof the sifter should be thoroughly cleaned daily following the procedures as\nrecommended for the sifter. At this time, connectors should be closely examined\nfor holes, cracks, or other damage. (To facilitate removal for cleaning, use of\neasily removable fastening devices are recommended.)\nd. Thoroughly vacuum or dry-brush clean all external parts of\nthe sifter, including the sifter frame and drive mechanism. 2. Wet cleaning program. -The procedures set forth\nbelow should be followed. a. Completely dismantle as in 1. above, remove all loose dry\nproduct; then rinse all parts with clear water; and follow by a thorough hand\nbrushing of all parts using a general purpose dairy cleaner. Rinse thoroughly\nto remove all evidence of cleaning solution or soil. It is recommended that hot\nwater (170°F (77°C) or above) be used for rinsing in order to sanitize the\nequipment and to aid the subsequent drying. b. Allow all parts to air dry completely prior to\nreassembly. c. The wet wash should be done as frequently as necessary and\nshould be done after each use if the sifter is not being used on a daily\nbasis. d. After cleaning, drying, and reassembly, the product outlet\nshould be protected against recontamination. 3. General recommendations. -a. Vacuum cleaning is\npreferred to brush cleaning or cleaning with air under pressure as it decreases\nthe dust drift problem to other areas of the plant. b. Brushes or vacuum cleaner fittings used for cleaning\nproduct-contact surfaces should not be used for cleaning nonproduct-contact\nsurfaces or for other uses which might result in contamination. Such brushes\nand special fitting should be stored in an enclosed cabinet when not in use. For protection and housekeeping considerations, such cabinets preferably should\nbe of non-wood construction and should have open mesh metal shelving. Note.-For additional details see\n3-A Sanitary Standards\nfor Sifters for Dry Milk and Dry Milk Products, Serial 26-01. Part B. Storage Bins\n\nThe use of portable bins is becoming increasingly popular with\nthe dry milk industry. These tote, or portable, storage bins when used shall\ncomply with the construction requirements of Item 11p and the cleaning and\nsanitizing requirements of Item 12p (sections\n3.19\nand\n3.20\n). If interior bracing and ladders are used in plant storage bins\nthey shall be constructed of smooth rounded metal, and be installed\nsufficiently far from the walls to prevent harborages. Product entrance and\ndischarge openings connected to the attending conveying equipment shall be\ndust-tight and shall be easily accessible for cleaning. Vents to the exterior\nshall be equipped with readily removable air filters of adequate capacity or\nreadily removable covers. If air is to be introduced into the product zone, only filtered air shall be used, and it shall comply with the applicable\nstandards of Appendix 7. Auxiliary agitators or any other interior devices, if\nused, shall be designed to be smooth, crevice-free, and readily cleanable. The\nexterior surface of the bin should be smooth, hard finished, and readily\ncleanable. Hinges on covers, if used, shall be the take-apart type. Covers or\ndoors shall be provided to enclose the product zone when product is not being\ndumped. These shall be so constructed that dirt or dust on top will not slide\nor fall into the bin when the cover is open. Access openings shall be provided\non all in-plant bins. Such openings should not be less than 18 inches in their\nsmallest dimension. Covers shall be constructed without raised internal\nreinforcements and should be hinged and equipped with a quick opening device. The gaskets for such openings shall be made of material which is nontoxic, nonabsorbent, smooth, and unaffected by the product. Storage bins in continuous\nuse either in the plant or in transporting dry products from one plant to\nanother should be cleaned according to manufacturer's recommendations when\nnecessary. They may be cleaned by either approved dry cleaning methods or wet\ncleaned. Part C. Packaging and Packages\n\nPackaging equipment for dry milk, dry milk products and dry\nwhey will vary greatly as to their design depending upon whether the packages\nbeing filled are drums, bins, or bags. Whatever equipment is used should be\ndesigned so as to protect the product from contamination from outside sources\nand from air during the packaging operation. All connections of conveying\nequipment to packaging devices should have dust-tight connections. All\nconveyors, ducts, belts, and screws used in connection with packaging equipment\nshould be provided with a dust collector system capable of eliminating any\nvisible dust, All product hoppers, when used, should be provided with covers to\nproperly protect the product from contamination. Hand filling should not be\npermitted except for periods of adjustment of automatic weighing\ndevices. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
