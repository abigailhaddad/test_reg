  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1.21 - Probationary registrations and licenses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person whose application for a\nlicense has been denied or whose license has been revoked, or any person whose\napplication for registration has been denied or whose registration has been\nrevoked and who has never before submitted an application or petition to the\ncommission seeking inclusion in the register after the final order of denial or\nrevocation of registration by the commission, may, upon application to the\ncommission, be granted leave to apply for a probationary registration or\nlicense. Any such person whose application for registration has been denied or\nwhose registration has been revoked must file his application for a\nprobationary registration within one year of the commission's final order of\ndenial or revocation. (For the purposes of this section, petitions for\nrehearing or reconsideration made substantially contemporaneously with the\ncommission's order of denial or revocation of registration shall not be\nconsidered as constituting a prior application or petition to the commission\nwhich seeks inclusion in the register.) Any person who is ineligible to apply\nfor probationary registration pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this\nsection may apply to the commission for the removal of his ineligibility so\nthat such person would not be disqualified, because of his previous denial or\nrevocation, from applying for registration upon the next occasion that the\ncommission opens the register pursuant to section 5-p of the Act. (b) (1)\n\nAny\nperson who has been granted such leave to apply for a probationary registration\nor license shall provide all the information required in the application for\nsuch status and shall complete said application pursuant to the instructions\ntherein. (2)\n\nWhere any such\napplicant is recommended for probationary status by another person who is\nwilling to act as his sponsor, such sponsor shall certify in the aforesaid\napplication that he desires to sponsor the applicant, that he agrees to\nundertake the supervision of the applicant during such probationary period and\nthat he shall use his best efforts to insure the applicant's compliance with\nthe Waterfront Commission Act, the terms and conditions of the probation and\nall other laws. (c) (1)\n\nUpon receipt of a completed and properly\nexecuted application, the staff member designated by the commission to\nsupervise the probationary case shall, if appropriate, forward said application\nto the division of police of the commission for a preliminary report on said\napplicant. (2)\n\nAfter receipt of the\npreliminary report, the said staff supervisor shall determine whether or not a\npermit or registration on a probationary status should be granted or denied, and shall submit his recommendation with respect thereto to the commission. If\nthe staff supervisor recommends that a probationary status be granted, he shall\nalso recommend the terms and conditions which he deems appropriate to impose on\nthe probationer, which may include, among others, the following: (i) That the waterfront employment of the\nprobationer shall be confined to a designated area of the waterfront. (ii)\n\nThat the business associations of the\nprobationer shall not include certain individuals, associations and/or\ngroups. (iii)\n\nThat the personal\nassociations of the probationer shall not include certain individuals or groups\nof individuals. (iv)\n\nThat the\nprobationer and/or his sponsor shall periodically report to the staff\nsupervisor who shall review the conduct and activity of the\nprobationer. (d) (1)\n\nIf, in the commission's opinion, granting of probation is warranted, the commission\nshall grant such probation for a period not exceeding six months upon such\nappropriate terms and conditions. (2)\n\nThe staff supervisor shall inform the\napplicant and the applicant's sponsor, if any, of the commission's action and\nof the terms and conditions imposed upon the applicant during the period of\nprobationary status. To grant probationary status, the order denying the\nprobationer's application or revoking his registration or license shall then be\namended so as not to be effective until further order of the\ncommission. (3)\n\nIf the prospective\nprobationer accepts the terms and conditions imposed, the probationer shall\nreport personally at a time designated to the staff supervisor. In addition to\nsuch periodic reports by the applicant, the sponsor of the applicant, if any, shall make periodic reports at times designated to the staff\nsupervisor. (e) If during\nthe six-month period of probation the commission does not receive any\ninformation indicating that the probationer has violated any of the provisions\nof the Act or any of the terms and conditions imposed or any other laws, the\nstaff supervisor assigned to review the conduct of the probationer shall, immediately prior to the expiration of the six-month probationary period, determine and recommend to the commission whether to terminate the probationary\nstatus or whether to continue it for an additional six-month period. The same\nprocedure shall be followed upon the expiration of any additional probationary\nperiods. (f) If the staff supervisor\nshall receive information indicating that the terms and conditions of probation\nhave been violated by the probationer, or that the probationer has violated any\nof the provisions of the Waterfront Commission Act or any other laws, the staff\nsupervisor shall, upon receipt of appropriate evidence of such violation, recommend that a hearing be held to determine whether the probationary terms\nand conditions, or whether any of the provisions of the Waterfront Commission\n\nAct or any other laws, have been violated by the probationer. (g) If the staff supervisor's recommendation\nfor a hearing is approved, he shall give the probationer sufficient notice of\nthe time and place of said hearing and of the issues to be considered at such\nhearing. The hearing shall be conducted by a person designated by the\ncommission, who shall have the authority and powers of an administrative judge\nunder section\n6.9\nof this Title. The probationer\nshall have an opportunity to appear at such hearing and may be assisted or\nrepresented by counsel or any qualified person, including the probationer's\nsponsor, and shall be so advised in the notice of hearing. At the hearing, the\nprobationer may testify in his own behalf and may present witnesses in his own\nbehalf. If the alleged violations to be heard are of such a nature that the\ncommission is of the opinion that the continuance of the probationary status\npending the outcome of the hearing is inimical to the public peace or safety, the commission may order the immediate suspension of the probationary\nregistration or license pending final determination of the hearing. (h) After the conclusion of the hearing, the\nperson conducting the hearing shall make such findings as he deems appropriate\nupon the issues contained in the notice of hearing, and shall submit such\nfindings to the commission, together with his recommendation for revocation or\ncontinuance of the probationary status upon any additional terms or conditions\nas he may deem appropriate. (i) The\ncommission shall determine, upon consideration of the findings and\nrecommendations and any other pertinent information that may be submitted or\nreceived, whether the probationary status shall be revoked or continued, and, if continued, whether any additional terms and conditions of probation shall be\nimposed.
