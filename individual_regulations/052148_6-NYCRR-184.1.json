  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 184.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The proper care\nof distressed wildlife requires special knowledge and facilities not possessed\nby the general public. The purpose of this Part is to establish a specially\ntrained group of individuals, collectively called wildlife rehabilitators, to\nprovide for the care of injured and debilitated wildlife so that such wildlife\nmay be returned to the wild. Appointed by the Department of Environmental\n\nConservation and licensed pursuant to Environmental Conservation Law, section\n11-0515, the wildlife rehabilitator is authorized to possess wildlife found by\nother persons and provide necessary aid. By encouraging that injured or\ndebilitated wildlife be placed in the care of specially trained wildlife\nrehabilitators, it is possible to achieve more humane care and greater\nexpectation that distressed wildlife can be returned to the wild. (b) Nothing in this Part authorizes or is\nintended to authorize a licensed wildlife rehabilitator to practice veterinary\nmedicine in violation of article 135 of the Education Law. A rehabilitator\nrendering gratuitous services in case of emergency should not attempt diagnosis\nor treatment beyond his or her level of skill and training. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n184.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
