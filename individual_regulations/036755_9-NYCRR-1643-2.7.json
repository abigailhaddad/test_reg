  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1643-2.7 - Permanent financing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Sale of\nbonds. (1)\n\nAside from the source of the funds\nand the manner of borrowing, the feature which distinguishes short-term\nborrowing by the State for the benefit of a local agency from the issue of\nbonds is that there is, generally speaking, a lapse of time between the\neffective date of the sale of the bond issue by the Comptroller and the receipt\nof the proceeds thereof by the local agency. Two accounts are provided to\nrecord the issue of the bonds on the books of the local agency, pending the\nreceipt of the proceeds by the local agency, viz: account 1123, State Housing\n\nFund, and account 2314, Certificates of Indebtedness Subscribed. When bonds are\nissued, the local agency will be advised by the division as to the principal\namount of the issue allocated to each project participating therein, the\neffective date of the issue, the maturity, interest rate, etc. Upon receipt of\nthis information, the following journal entry is made: Entry (11): Debit: Account 1123, State Housing Fund $XXX\nCredit: Account 2314, Certificate of\n\nIndebtedness\n\nSubscribed $XXX\nExplanation:To record the issuance of housing bonds by\nthe State of New York, bond issue no. ________, dated (insert date of issue), 19 ________as per letter from Division of Housing, dated ________, ________. (2)\n\nIf the\nproject is already indebted to the State, by virtue of having borrowed money\nfrom the State for temporary financing prior to the issuance of housing bonds, this entry will reflect only the difference between the amount of such\nindebtedness and the amount of the bond issue. The local agency will, of\ncourse, have issued its certificates of indebtedness as evidence of such prior\nindebtedness and the State Comptroller will apply the proceeds directly to the\npayment of the short-term notes issued by the State in connection therewith. Entry (11) above should not reflect any part of the premium, if any, on the\nhousing bond issue. Recording of the premium is discussed in subdivision (e) of\nthis section. (b) Receipt of proceeds of bond issue. (1)\n\nAs has\nbeen previously noted, there is, generally speaking, some lapse of time between\nthe sale of the bonds and the receipt of the proceeds thereof by the local\nagency. The State Comptroller, depending on the circumstances, may remit the\nproceeds in one lump sum, or in installments, as required. He may, further, apply the proceeds directly to retire short-term notes issued by the State and\nalso withhold a balance, representing the excess of the bond issue over the\ndevelopment cost to date, in the State Housing Fund for a longer period of\ntime. Remittances are made by way of the division, which will transmit the\ncheck to the local agency with a request that a certificate of indebtedness be\nissued for the amount of the remittance, together with the requisition and\nclosing papers. When a remittance for any part of the proceeds is received for\ndeposit by the local agency, the following entry is made through the cash\nreceipts register: Entry (12): Debit: Account 1111, Development Fund $XXX\nCredit: Account 1123, State Housing Fund $XXX\n(2)\n\nWhen the certificate of\nindebtedness is issued, the following journal entry is made: Entry (13): Debit: Account 2314, Certificates of\n\nIndebtedness\n\nSubscribed $XXX\nCredit: Account 2312, Certificate of Indebtedness\n\nUnissued $XXX\nExplanation:To record the issue of certificate of\nindebtedness no. ________for proceeds received on account of housing bond issue\nno. ________. (c) Payment of temporary loan notes\noutstanding. (1)\n\nThe application of the\nproceeds of the bond issue by the local agency to the payment of the agency's\ntemporary loan notes will be reflected in the following entries: Entry (14): Through the Cash Disbursements-Voucher\n\nRegister: Debit: Account 2120, Temporary Loan Notes Payable\n$XXX\nDebit: Account 2132.2, Accrued Interest Payable\n\nTemporary Loan Notes $XXX\nCredit: Account 1111, Development Fund $XXX\nExplanation:To record payment and cancellation of\ntemporary loan notes nos. ________. (2)\n\nThe local agency should hold the\ncancelled requisition agreement and advance loan note returned by the escrow\nagent in its files. No accounting entry is made to reflect the\ncancellation. (3)\n\nAs in the case of\nthe payment of temporary loan notes out of the proceeds of an issue of\nshort-term notes (see §1463-2.5[g]), a representative of the division may, under certain circumstances, deliver the State's check, for the proceeds of a\nbond issue, directly to the paying agent for the maturing issue of temporary\nloan. In this event, the remittance for the proceeds of the bond issue will not\npass through the project's development fund and the following journal entry\nwill be made, in lieu of entry (12) above: Entry (15): Debit: Account 2120, Temporary Loan Notes Payable\n$XXX\nDebit: Account 2132.2, Accrued Interest\n\nPayable--\nTemporary Loan Notes $XXX\nCredit: Account 1123, State Housing Fund $XXX\nExplanation:To record the application of the proceeds\nof housing bond issue no. ________, to the payment of principal and interest on\ntemporary loan notes no.________. (4)\n\nEntry (13) is then made in the usual\nmanner and the division will hold the advance loan note against the receipt of\nthe certificate of indebtedness. (d) Disposition of balance of certificates of\nindebtedness unissued. After the final development cost has been determined, and the definitive amount of the loan established, a resolution amending the\noriginal debt authorizing resolution should be adopted conforming the\nauthorization to the definitive amount of the loan. A journal entry, adjusting\naccount 2311, Certificates of Indebtedness Authorized, and account 2312, Certificates of Indebtedness Unissued, accordingly, should be made. (e) Premiums on State housing bonds. (1)\n\nThe Comptroller may receive from\npurchasers of housing bonds amounts over and above the face value of the bonds. These amounts represent the premium on the bonds and are paid into the State\n\nHousing Debt Fund. This fund is operated by the Comptroller as a debt service\nfund to receive payments of interest and amortization on the bond issue from\nthe local agency and to disburse the same to bond holders. The State Housing\n\nDebt Fund should not be confused with the State Housing Fund into which is paid\nthe proceeds of a bond issue, exclusive of premiums, if any, thereon. The\ndivision is notified by the Comptroller as to the amount of the premium, if\nany, allocable to each project participating in the issue and will, in turn, notify the local agency likewise. The premium is then recorded by the following\njournal entry. Entry (16): Debit: Account 1124, State Housing Debt Fund\n$XXX\nCredit: Account 1420.8, Premium on State Housing Bonds\n$XXX\nExplanation:To record the premium on housing bond issue\nno. ________, as per letter from Division on Housing, dated ________, 19________. (2)\n\nThe full\namount of the premium is credited to development costs whether the bonds have\nbeen issued prior or subsequent to the date of substantial completion. For the\napplication of the premium to the payments of interest on the bonds, see Part\n1644, Debt Service. No allocation of premium on State housing bonds should be\nmade to the related programs. (f) Cost of borrowing. In connection with\neach issue of bonds, the State Comptroller incurs expenses for advertising for\nbids, printing, engraving, etc. The Comptroller, ordinarily pays these expenses\nout of the State Housing Fund and advises the division as to the portion\napplicable to each project participating in the issue. The division, in turn, will notify the local agency, which will draw a check on the project's\ndevelopment fund. Expenses incurred by the Comptroller in connection with the\nissuance of bonds are charged to account 1420.7, Cost of Borrowing, through the\ncash disbursements-voucher register. Account 1420.7 is charged for the cost of\nborrowing whether the bonds have been issued prior or subsequent to the date of\nsubstantial completion. No allocation of the cost of borrowing should be made\nto the related programs. Where, however, expenses are incurred by the\n\nComptroller in connection with the issuance of bonds after physical completion, the account to be charged is 4140, Project Office Expense. Notes\nN.Y.
