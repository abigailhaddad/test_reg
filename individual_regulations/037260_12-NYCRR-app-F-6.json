Codes R. & Regs. tit. 12, Appendices, app F-6\n\nState Regulations\nBODY MEASUREMENTS FOR THE SIZING OF APPAREL FOR INFANTS, BABIES, TODDLERS AND CHILDREN\n(For the Knit Underwear Industry)\n1\n(Commercial Standard CS 151-50; issued by the U.S. Department of\n\nCommerce.)\n\nOn September 10, 1945, at the instance of the Mail Order\n\nAssociation of America, a Recommended Commercial Standard on Body Measurements\nfor the Sizing of Apparel for Infants, Babies, Toddlers, and Children was\npresented to interested producers, distributors, and users for written\nacceptance. The knit underwear industry has accepted and approved the\ncommercial standard as shown herein. The standard is effective for the knit\nunderwear industry from October 30, 1948. PURPOSE\n1. The purpose is to provide standard classifications, size\ndesignations, and body measurements for the sizing of infants', babies', toddlers', and children's ready-to-wear apparel for the guidance of those\nengaged in producing, or preparing specifications for, ready-to-wear garments\nand patterns. Another purpose is to recommend methods of determining lengths of\ndresses, coats, skirts and slacks (outseams) from appropriate body\nmeasurements. Size ranges for the more important types of babies' garments are\ngiven. SCOPE\n2. This standard covers: (a) Classifications and size ranges\n(a) (1) Infants - in one size only (see table 1, footnote\nA)\n(a) (2) Babies - in sizes from 3 mo. to 36 mo. (a) (3) Toddlers - in sizes from number 1 to 4\n(a) (4) Children - in sizes from number 2 to 6X\n- 2 -\nSizing of Apparel - Infants to Children....... (b) Size designations\n(c) Composite body measurements of boys and girls for \"regular\"\nsizes, up to a stature of 48 inches and a weight of 54 pounds. (d) Lengths of garments\n(e) Methods of measuring\n(e) (1) General\n(e) (2) Vertical measurements of body\n(e) (3) Girth measurements of body\n(e) (4) Width and length measurements of body\n(e) (5) Garment lengths\n(f) Relationship of stature measurements to the sizing\nsystem\n(g) Recommended methods of identification\n(h) Explanation of adjustments made in body measurements\nAPPLICATION\n3. The methods and measurements given herein are applicable\nto: (a) Coordination of body measurements of the child, as defined, with ready-to-wear size designations. (b) Garment patterns and specifications, as a basis of\ngradations between sizes. (c) Length measurements of the finished garment as delivered by\nthe manufacturer. DEFINITIONS\n4. Definitions of the more important body landmarks shown in\nfigure 1, are given in paragraph 5. Sizing of Apparel - Infants to Children - 3 -....... Click\nto view image\n5. Body Landmarks\n(a) Crown\n- Top of head (A, fig. 1). (b) Cervicale\n- The prominence on the seventh\nor lowest cervical vertebra at the back of the neck (B, fig. 1) which becomes\nmore prominent when the head is bent forward. (Cervicale height measurements\nare taken, however, only when the head is in an erect position.)\n(c) Waist\n- The lower edge of lower floating\nrib, located at the side of the body in a line directly below the center of the\narmpit (C, fig. 1). (d) Hip\n- The outer bony prominence of the\nupper end of the thigh bone (the femur) (D, fig. 1). (e) Knee\n- The inner bony prominence of the\nupper end of the tibia, the larger of the two bones of the leg extending from\nknee to ankle (E, fig. 1). (f) Ankle\n- The inner bony prominence of the\nlower end of the tibia at the ankle (F, fig. 1). - 4 - Sizing of Apparel - Infants to Children....... METHODS OF MEASURING-GENERAL\n6. Accuracy. Body measurements are taken to\nthe nearest\n1\n/\n8\ninch. Garment\nlength measurements are taken to the nearest 1/2 inch. 7. Garment\nlengths. 2\n\nThe garment to be measured is\nlaid out without tension on a smooth flat surface so that creases and wrinkles\nwill not affect the measurements. Methods of Measuring the\n\nBody\n3\n8. Vertical measurements. (a) Stature\n- Measured from crown to soles of\nfeet. (b) Cervicale height\n- Measured from cervicale\n(par. 5(b)) to soles of feet. (c) Waist height\n- Measured from waist (par. 5(c)) to soles of feet. This waist height establishes the waist level around\nthe body. (d) Hip height\n- Measured from hip (par. 5(d))\nto soles of feet. (e) Knee Height\n- Measured from knee (par, 5(e)) to soles of feet. (f) Ankle height\n- Measured from ankle (par. 5(f)) to soles of feet. 9. Girth measurements\n(a) When indoor clothing is worn - a dress by girls, and a\nshirt and trousers or pants, without a belt, by\nboys. 4\n\nSizing of Apparel - Infants to Children - 5 -....... (1)\n\nChest\n(girth) - Measured horizontally\nclose up under arms. The measurement should include the lower portion of the\nshoulder blades. (2)\n\nWaist\n(girth) - Measured horizontally at\nwaist height (par. 8(c)), with belt or sash removed. (3)\n\nHip\n(girth) - Measured horizontally at hip\nheight (par. 8(d)).

(d) Total crotch length\n- Measured from waist\nlevel at the front, through the crotch to the waist level at the back (C\nthrough N to C\n1, figs. 2 and 5), For waist level, see\nparagraph 8(c). (e) Shoulder and arm length\n- Measured from\nthe intersection of the neck and shoulder lines along the outside (posterior)\nsurface of the am, with the elbow flexed, to the prominent wrist bone at the\nback of the hand (0 to M, fig. 6). - 8 - Sizing of Apparel - Infants to Children....... 11. Garment lengths. (a) Length of dresses and coats. - Measured\nfrom the high neck point at the \"center back\"\n5\nalong\nthe \"center back\" line, to the bottom of the garment. (b) Length of skirts. - Measured from the top\nof the belt, at the \"center back\" along the \"center back\" line, to the bottom\nof the garment. (c) Length of slacks. - Measured from the top\nof the waist band to the finished lower edge of the garment. This is the\noutseam or side-seam length. (d) Length of hands. - Measured from center of\nshoulder strap to bottom of garment. (e) Length of shirts. - Measured from neck\nedge of shoulder seam to bottom of garment. STATURE MEASUREMENTS AS SIZE INDICATORS\n12. In view of the fact that stature measurements are the\npredominant growth measurements of infants, toddlers, and children and also one\nof the best single indicators of other body measurements, the sizes in this\nstandard are based primarily on even variations (2, 2 1/2 or 3 inches) in\nstature measurements. 12a. Weights corresponding to the given statures and chest or\nhip girths are high-lighted in the tables for the convenience of the user. They\nhave been adjusted to compensate for the weight of indoor clothing, assumed to\nbe worn by the child when the body measurements are taken. CLASSIFICATIONS AND CORRESPONDING MEASUREMENTS\n13. The size designations and corresponding body measurements\nare given in tables 1, 5 and 7 for the four classifications. 13a. The lengths for dresses, coats, skirts, slacks, bands and\nshirts are given in tables 2, 6 and 8. 13b. The size ranges for the more important types of infants'\nand babies' garments are given in tables 3 and 4. Sizing of Apparel - Infants to Children - 9 -....... Table 1.

Infants' garments are to\nbe made in one size only, babies' in more than one (see tables 3 and 4). B/ These measurements are\nbody, not\ngarment\nmeasurements. The size-to-size gradations in these\nbody measurements may be applied to garment patterns or specifications in\ngrading, but they are not to be considered actual garment measurements. C/ Since even gradations in vertical body measurements between\nsizes serves to make this standard more useful in grading garment patterns or\nspecifications, minor adjustments\n(\n1\n/\n8\nof an inch) have been\nmade in a few instances to achieve this purpose. - 10 - Sizing of Apparel - Infants to Children.......

B/ Although garments made for this size (3) are made to fit\nchildren of the same body measurements as those of the toddlers'\nclassification, the difference in posture of the older children of this\nclassification and the different proportioning of their garments require longer\ndress and coat lengths. Accordingly, to distinguish size 3 garments of this\nclassification from those of the toddler's classification, it is recommended\nthat the letter \"L\" (signifying length) be added to the size designation, e.g. 3L. - 16 - Sizing of Apparel - Infants to Children.......

In order to assure consumers that published scales of body\nmeasurements for the sizing of apparel conform to this standard, it is\nrecommended that catalogs and sales literature carry the following\nstatement: Sizes of\n\nInfants', Babies', Toddlers' or\n\nChildren's\n(Use only name of applicable classification)\n\nApparel are designated and proportioned in accordance with\nCS151-50, as developed by the trade, under the procedure of the National Bureau\nof Standards, and issued by the U. S. Department of Commerce. 15. In order to assure the purchaser that she is receiving\ngarments which conform to this system of body measurement sizing, it is\nrecommended that such garments be identified by a sticker, tag, hanger, or\nother label attached to the garment carrying the following statement. SIZE ____, CS151-50\nHEIGHT __, WEIGHT __, * __ __\n* Use appropriate critical measurement, such as chest, waist, vertical trunk girth, etc. EXPLANATORY\n(The following explanatory paragraphs have been prepared for\nthose who are interested in ascertaining how the body measurements in this\nstandard were derived.)\n16. Sources. The body measurements for\nchildren under 4 years of age were compiled from various anthropometric data\n(see bibliography on page 18). The body measurements for children 4 years and\nolder are based on Miscellaneous Publication No. 366, \"Body Measurements of\n\nAmerican Boys and Girls for Garment and Pattern Construction\", issued by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. 16a. The method of joining the two groups of data into a\ncontinuous growth curve was developed by the National Bureau of\n\nStandards. 16b. The body measurements for sizes 4, 5, 6, and 6X of the\n\nChildren's classification, based upon Miscellaneous Publication No. 366, represent a compromise between the data given in \"C\" columns of tables 23 and\n25, which are the most common measurements of children of given statures, and\nthe \"D\" columns of tables 24 and 26, which are the measurements of the next\nstouter groups. It was considered impractical to develop separate scales of\nbody measurements for the \"C\" and the \"D\" groups, as the statures for both\ngroups are the same, and the chest girths vary less than one inch. Further, it\nwas desired to have the measurements reflect the proportions of the \"D\" or\n\"stouter\" group to some degree. Sizing of Apparel - Infants to Children\n- 17 -....... 16c. The measurements for the thigh girth, neck base girth, armscye girth, and cross-back width represent graphic extrapolations from\nmeasurements in Miscellaneous Publication No. 366. 17. Adjustments to effect compromise between boys' and\ngirls' measurements. Since the variations in measurements between the\nsexes were not considered sufficient to warrant giving separate measurements\nfor each group, the body measurements in this standard are based upon a\ncomposite of boys' and girls' measurements. 18. Adjustments for clothing allowances. Allowances for clothing have been added to the basic body measurements in\naccordance with the definition in paragraph 9 that the girth body measurements\nshould be taken over clothing: In view of the possible variations in the types\nof garments worn, and the weights of the fabrics used in those garments, the\nfollowing uniform clothing allowances were selected: (a) Weight - Babies' - 8 oz; Toddlers' - 11 oz; and Children's\n- 14 oz. (b) Chest - 3/4 of an inch. (c) Waist - 1 inch. (d) Hip- 3/4 of an inch. (e) Vertical trunk girth - 2 inches. (f) Total crotch length - 11/4 inches. 19. Adjustments to achieve more uniform gradations\nbetween sizes. Unadjusted body measurements frequently do not result\nin even gradations between sizes. Therefore, it has been necessary to make\nminor adjustments in the measurements to insure more even gradations between\nsizes. However, except for a slight \"thickening\" at the waist, due to the\ngreater variation of the waist girth in relation to the other body\nmeasurements, and the clothing allowances indicated in paragraph 18, the girth\nmeasurements reflect the general chest, waist and hip proportions of children\nof the given statures and weights. Bibliography on page 18. While the above is the complete standard, additional material\nof interest to those concerned will be contained in a printed pamphlet entitled\n\"Body Measurements for the Sizing of Apparel for Infants, Babies, Toddlers, and\n\nChildren (For the Knit Underwear Industry), CS151-50\", issued by the United\n\nStates Department of Commerce. This pamphlet will include, in addition to the\nstandard, a list of acceptors, brief history of the project, membership of the\n\nStanding Committee, etc., but the printing of it will be held in abeyance until\nthe other affected producer groups (besides knit underwear group) have had an\nopportunity to indicate the extent of their support for this system of\nsizing. - 18 - Sizing of Apparel - Infants to Children.......

Footnotes\nA/ The principal difference between the classifications\n\"Infants\" and \"Babies\" is a merchandising difference. Infants' garments are to\nbe made in one size only, babies' in more than one (see tables 3 and 4). B/ These measurements are\nbody, not\ngarment\nmeasurements. The size-to-size gradations in these\nbody measurements may be applied to garment patterns or specifications in\ngrading, but they are not to be considered actual garment measurements. C/ Since even gradations in vertical body measurements between\nsizes serves to make this standard more useful in grading garment patterns or\nspecifications, minor adjustments\n(\n1\n/\n8\nof an inch) have been\nmade in a few instances to achieve this purpose. 1 This system of sizing has been endorsed by a majority of\nproduction of knit underwear. The use of this standard, however, is not\nrestricted to that industry, but may be used by all other segments of the\napparel industry, as applicable. 2 Length measurements of garments are included in this standard\nbecause they closely approximate the distance between the landmarks that apply\nto particular garments, and serve to insure a greater degree of uniformity in\ntrade interpretation of these data. 3 More complete information regarding the methods of measuring\nthe body be obtained from item 6 of Bibliography, on page 18. 4 It is assumed oat customary undergarments will be worn\nunderneath the outer apparel (See par. 18). 5 Center back: This is the term used in the apparel industry to\ndescribe the position of the seam at the center of the back (from cervicale to\nhem) or the corresponding imaginary line when no seem appears in the\ngarment.
