(b) For the purpose of this\n\nSubpart, the following definitions also apply: (1)\n'Arc quenching medium.' The use of a\nmaterial to interrupt an electrical arc. (2)\n'Bulk regulated substances.' Regulated\nsubstances of any amount in a container for the transportation or storage of\nthat substance, such as cylinders, drums, ISO tanks, and small cans. A\nregulated substance that must first be transferred from a container to another\ncontainer, vessel, or piece of equipment in order to realize its intended use\nis a bulk substance. A regulated substance contained in a manufactured product\nsuch as an appliance or an aerosol can is not a bulk substance. (3)\n'Chamber cleaning.' The process of using\nfluorinated gases to remove excess materials from chemical vapor deposition\nchamber walls to prevent contamination of wafers to be processed. (4)\n'Chemical vapor deposition or CVD.'\nDeposition of thin films on wafers by placing the wafers in a mixture of gases, including nitrogen or other gas used as a carrier, which react at the surface\nof the wafers. (5)\n'Destroy.' To\ncause the expiration of a previously produced substance to the destruction\nefficiency actually achieved. Such destruction does not result in a\ncommercially useful end product. (6)\n'Dielectric medium.' The use of a\nmaterial that does not conduct electricity but can sustain an electric field, with electrical conductivity of less than a millionth\n(10\n-6\n) of a siemens. (7)\n'Distributor.' A person to whom a\nregulated substance is delivered or sold for purposes of export, subsequent\nsale or delivery in New York State, or any person who imports regulated\nsubstances from outside of New York State to distribute and/or sell in New York\n\nState, or any person who acts as an agent or broker in buying regulated\nsubstances for distribution or sale in New York State. Distributor does not\ninclude owners or operators of equipment who sell or transfer recovered\nsubstances to another entity for reclaim or destruction or persons who return\nproducts to the seller. Distributors may include wholesale purchasers who\nintend to resell, deliver, or otherwise supply regulated substances to\nfacilities in New York State. (8)\n'Etching.' A chemical reactive process for selectively removing material on a\nwafer using fluorinated, ionized gases. (9)\n'Equipment calibration.' The process of\nestablishing the relationship between a measuring device and the units of\nmeasure. This is done by comparing a device or the output of an instrument to a\nstandard having known measurement characteristics. (10)\n'Investment casting.' The process of\ncasting magnesium into a mold produced by surrounding, or investing, an\nexpendable pattern with a refractory material. Also called precision casting or\nlost wax process. (11)\n'Laboratory\nfume hood.' A boxlike structure enclosing a source of potential air\ncontamination, with one open or partially open side, into which air is moved\nfor the purpose of containing and exhausting air contaminants, generally used\nfor bench-scale laboratory operations but not necessarily involving the use of\na bench or table. (12)\n'Manufacture.' To complete the manufacturing, production, or assembly processes\nof a substance, product, or piece of equipment such that it is ready for\ninitial sale, distribution, use or operation. (13)\n'Manufacturer or Producer.' Any person\nthat produces, manufactures, formulates, or otherwise creates a bulk regulated\nsubstance or products or equipment that contains regulated substances in its\nfinal form for distribution or use at or outside of a manufacturing or\nproduction facility. This does not include reuse or recycling of a substances\nor the creation and destruction of intermediate substances in a single process\nwith no storage of the intermediate substances. (14)\n'Product.' An item or category of items\nmanufactured from raw or recycled materials which performs a function or task\nand is functional upon completion of manufacturing. The term includes but is\nnot limited to equipment that contains regulated substances or containers of\nregulated substances that is made available for immediate use rather than\nprovided in bulk. (15)\n'Reclaimer.'\nAny person who accepts regulated substances for the purposes of reclaim and\nsubsequent sale to a new owner. (16)\n'Regulated substance.' A substance that\ncontains a fluorinated greenhouse gas and has a GWP20 greater than 10 or that\nis reasonably anticipated to have a Global Warming Potential greater than 10\nover an integrated twenty-year time frame. Regulated substances must be\nreferred to using standard naming conventions such as from the IPCC Assessment\n\nReport, Chemical Abstracts Service, or International Union of Pure and Applied\n\nChemistry. (17)\n'Research.'\nInvestigations conducted at a research facility. (18)\n'Research facility.' A physical location\nconsisting of one or more buildings, such as a campus, which are all part of a\nsingle entity and whose primary purpose is to conduct research and/or provide\neducation. The facility is under close supervision of technically trained\npersonnel and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for sale in\ncommerce or other off-site distribution. A research facility must be a U.S. government owned national laboratory or an accredited post-secondary\ninstitution that grants advanced academic degrees. Accreditation must be from a\nU.S. Department of Education approved accrediting agency. (19)\n'Sand casting' The process of producing\na part by forming a mold from a sand mixture and pouring molten magnesium into\nthe cavity in the mold. (20)\n'Supplier.' A producer, manufacturer, or distributor of any applicable\nsubstance or equipment. (21)\n'Tracer gas testing.' The process of marking air or other media with a gas or\nother substance, which is released into an enclosure, laboratory fume hood, room, building, or environment to detect, measure, monitor, or evaluate flow\nrate, leakage, or dispersion or dilution characteristics.
