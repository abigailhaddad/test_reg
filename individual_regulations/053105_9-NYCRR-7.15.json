Tit. 9 § 7.15 - Executive order no. 15: establishing a task force on public employee retiree health care benefits\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, it is in the interest of all New Yorkers that the\n\nState and local governments provide retirees receiving health care benefits\nwith quality and affordable health care; and\nWHEREAS, many retirees have expressed concern that their\nhealth benefits will be singled out for reduction during difficult fiscal\ntimes; and\nWHEREAS, health care costs have consistently grown faster\nthan the rate of inflation in recent years, straining the finances of public\nemployers; and\nWHEREAS, Government Accounting Standards Bulletin (GASB) 45\nrequires greater disclosure on public entities' financial statements of the\ntheir future health care liabilities to retired employees, and failure to\nproperly account for these liabilities could potentially impact the State's or\nlocalities' financial rating; and\nWHEREAS, there is a need for a dispassionate and informed\nstudy of this issue, which will allow for compilation of relevant background\ninformation; sharing of viewpoints between interested parties; exploration and\nevaluation of possible reform proposals; and efforts to reach consensus and\nmake recommendations on relevant issues.
