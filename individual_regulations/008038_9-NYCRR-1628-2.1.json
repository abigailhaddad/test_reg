  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1628-2.1 - Budget program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The budget\nis a plan of operation for the fiscal year. Every effort should be made to\nprepare a budget which presents a program designed to meet all the fiscal\nobligations and to keep the condition and appearance of the project up to high\nstandards. In turn, the budget as approved should be adhered so that the plan\nof operation is properly executed. The budget is an important tool in the\nsuccessful management of a project. (b) The budget should be realistic. Projection of income and expenses should reflect past experience modified by\nany changes expected to occur during the budget year. Reasonable estimates must\nnot be adjusted downward for the purpose of attaining a deficit within the\nlimits of the maximum subsidy. If realistic estimates indicate a deficit in\nexcess of maximum subsidy, effective economies or means of added income must be\ndevised before preliminary budget is submitted to the Bureau of\n\nManagement. (c) Economy of\noperation is a constant objective, but it should be specially considered in\ndeveloping the budget. The subsidy required for the deficit operation must be\nkept as low as possible. Section\n73\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law limits the amount of subsidy that may be paid by the State. Proper concern for the public funds involved demands that subsidy requirements\nbe kept to a minimum by economical project operation, regardless of the maximum\nsubsidy permitted. In any event, the estimated deficit of a proposed budget\nmust be based on justifiable expenses and reserves, and must reflect income\nfrom rents which bear a fair share of the project's expenses, with due regard\nfor the income levels of tenants and applicants. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1628-2.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
