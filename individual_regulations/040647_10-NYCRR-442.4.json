  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.4 - Reporting period\n\nState Regulations\n[1130]\n(a) For cost reporting purposes, the program\nwill require submission of annual reports covering a 12-month period of\noperations based upon the provider's accounting year. (b) The provider may select any annual period\nfor cost reporting purposes as long as the reporting period selected is the\nsame as that used for Medicare reimbursement. Once a provider has made a\nselection and reported accordingly, it is required thereafter to report\nannually for periods ending as of the same date, unless the intermediary\napproves a change in the provider's reporting period. (c) A cost reporting period under the program\nconsisting of one of the following will be considered in compliance with the\nreporting periods cited above: (1)\n12\nsuccessive calendar months; (2)\n13\nfour-week periods with an additional day (two in a leap year) added to the last\nweek or period to make it coincide with the end of the calendar year or month; or\n(3)\na reporting period which\nwill vary from 52 to 53 weeks because it must always end on the same day of the\nweek (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) and always end on: (i) whatever date this same day of the week\nlast occurs in a calendar month; or\n(ii)\nwhatever date this same day of the week\nfalls on which is nearest to the last day of the calendar month, even though\nthis same day falls in the first week of the following month. (d) The method selected\nmust be consistently followed. (e) A provider may prepare a short-period cost report for part of a year under the\ncircumstances described in sections 2414.1 through 2414.3 of the Medicare\n\nProvider Reimbursement Manual (HIM-15), part I. (f) Providers in a chain organization, or\nother group of providers, are required to file individual cost\nreports. (g) Upon entering the\nhealth insurance program, a new provider may select an initial cost reporting\nperiod of at least 1 month but not to exceed 13 months. For example, a new\nprovider which starts with the Medicare program on September 15, 1974, and\nwishes to adopt a reporting period ending September 30, 1974, must file a\nreport for the period September 15, 1974 to September 30, 1975. Such a provider\ncannot file a report for the 15-day period ending September 30, 1974. (h) A hospital beginning operations must\nselect an initial reporting period beginning on the first day of operation, through the last month preceding the hospital's selected fiscal year. For\nexample, a hospital beginning operations August 15, 1980, selecting a fiscal\nyear beginning January 1st, would have an initial fiscal period running from\n\nAugust 15, 1980 through December 31, 1980. It would then move to the standard\n\nJanuary 1st to December 31st fiscal year. (i) Whatever fiscal year is used for\nreporting purposes must coincide with that used for Medicare (Medicaid for\n\nMedicaid-only hospitals) cost reporting purposes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
