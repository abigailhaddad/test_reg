  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7076.5 - Programming\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Incarcerated\nindividuals in segregated confinement shall be offered out-of-cell programming\nat least four (4) hours per day, including at least one (1) hour for\nexercise. (b) Incarcerated\nindividuals in segregated confinement shall be offered programming led by\nprogram or therapeutic staff five (5) days per week, except on recognized state\nlegal holidays. All other out-of-cell time may include peer-led programs, time\nin a day room or out-of-cell recreation area with other people, congregate\nmeals, volunteer programs, or other congregate activities. (c) If established that an incarcerated\nindividual committed a violent felony act while in segregated confinement and\nposes a significant and unreasonable risk to the safety and security of other\nincarcerated individuals or staff, the chief administrative officer may\nrestrict such individual's participation in programming and out-of-cell\nactivities as necessary for the safety of other incarcerated individuals and\nstaff. If such restrictions are imposed, the facility must provide at least\nfour (4) hours out-of-cell time daily, including at least two (2) hours of\ntherapeutic programming and two (2) hours of exercise, and must make reasonable\nefforts to reinstate access to programming as soon as possible. In no case may\nsuch restrictions extend beyond fifteen (15) days unless the incarcerated\nindividual commits a new violent felony act justifying restrictions on program\naccess, or if the chief administrative officer reasonably determines that the\nincarcerated individual poses an extraordinary and unacceptable risk of\nimminent harm to the safety or security of other incarcerated individuals or\nstaff. Any extension of program restrictions beyond fifteen (15) days must be\nmeaningfully reviewed and approved at least every fifteen (15) days by the\nchief administrative officer. Each review must consider the impact of\ntherapeutic programming provided during the fifteen (15) day period on the\nindividual's risk of imminent harm and the chief administrative must articulate\nin writing, with a copy provided to the incarcerated individual, the specific\nreason why the individual currently poses an extraordinary and unacceptable\nrisk of imminent harm to the safety or security of incarcerated individuals or\nstaff. In no case may restrictions imposed by the chief administrative officer\nextend beyond ninety (90) days unless the individual commits a new violent\nfelony act justifying restrictions on program access.
