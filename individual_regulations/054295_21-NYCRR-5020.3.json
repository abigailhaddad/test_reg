  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 5020.3 - Standard for determining disability retirement for members joining on or after September 1, 1983, who meet the eligibility requirements of section 605 of the Retirement and Social Security Law\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn order for a member to be entitled to disability retirement\nunder section\n605\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, it must be determined that the member is totally and permanently disabled, and that the member was so disabled at the time he ceased performance of\nduties. To be deemed totally disabled, it must be concluded that the member is\nphysically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of gainful employment. Gainful employment, as used in this section, shall be physical and/or mental\nactivity which a member is regularly able to engage in as a means of earning a\nliving. To be deemed permanently disabled, the condition must be such to\njustify a deduction that any recovery by the member is far removed in the\nfuture and that the end of the disability cannot be foreseen for at least one\nyear. In addition, total disability is not permanent if, during the period for\nwhich recovery is sought or at any time thereafter, the member may alleviate or\ncontrol the condition by availing himself or herself of a standard treatment\nwhich is not inherently dangerous. The member shall have the burden of\nestablishing all of the foregoing to the satisfaction of the Retirement\n\nBoard. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n5020.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
