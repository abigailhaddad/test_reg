  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.487 - Remedial measures: distribution lines other than cast iron or ductile iron lines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except for\ncast iron or ductile iron pipe, each segment of generally corroded distribution\nline pipe with a remaining wall thickness less than that required for the\nmaximum allowable operating pressure of the pipeline, or a remaining wall\nthickness less than 30 percent of the nominal wall thickness, must be replaced. However, if the area of general corrosion is small, the corroded pipe may be\nrepaired by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can\npermanently restore the serviceability of the pipe. Corrosion pitting so\nclosely grouped as to affect the overall strength of the pipe is considered\ngeneral corrosion. (b) Except for\ncast iron or ductile iron pipe, each segment of distribution main with\nlocalized corrosion pitting to a degree where leakage might result must be\nreplaced or repaired. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.487\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
