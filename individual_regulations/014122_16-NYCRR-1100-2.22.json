  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 1100-2.22 - Exhibit 21: Electric System Effects and Interconnection\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 21 shall contain: (a) A detailed description of the proposed\nelectric interconnection, including: (1)\n\nThe\ndesign voltage and voltage of initial operation; (2)\n\nThe type, size, number and materials of\nconductors; (3)\n\nThe insulator\ndesign; (4)\n\nThe length of the\ntransmission line; (5)\n\nThe typical\ndimensions and construction materials of the towers; (6)\n\nThe design standards for each type of\ntower and tower foundation; (7)\n\nFor\nunderground construction, the type of cable system to be used and the\ndesignstandards for that system; (8)\n\nFor underground construction, indicate on\na profile of the line the depth of the cable and the location of any oil\npumping stations and manholes; (9)\n\nEquipment to be installed in any proposed switching station or substation\nincluding an explanation of the necessity for any such switching station or\nsubstation; (10)\n\nAny terminal\nfacility; and\n(11)\n\nThe need for\ncathodic protection measures. (b) A system reliability impact study, performed in accordance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission-approved\n\nOpen Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) of the New York Independent System\n\nOperator, Inc. (NYISO), available at\nwww.nyiso.com, that shows expected flows on the\nsystem under normal, peak and emergency conditions and effects on stability of\nthe interconnected system, including the necessary technical analyses (thermal, voltage, short circuit and stability) to evaluate the impact of the\ninterconnection. The study shall include the new electric interconnection\nbetween the facility and the point of interconnection, as well as any other\nsystem upgrades required. (c) An\nevaluation of the potential significant impacts of the facility and its\ninterconnection to transmission system reliability at a level of detail that\nreflects the magnitude of the impacts. (d) A discussion of the benefits and\ndetriments of the facility on ancillary services and the electric transmission\nsystem, including impacts associated with reinforcements and new construction\nnecessary as a result of the facility. (e) An estimate of the increase or decrease\nin the total transfer capacity across each affected interface, and if a\nforecasted reduction in transfer capability across affected interfaces violates\nreliability requirements, an evaluation of reasonable corrective measures that\ncould be employed to mitigate or eliminate said reduction. (f) A description of criteria, plans, and\nprotocols for generation and ancillary facilities' design, construction, commissioning, and operation, including as appropriate to generation\ntechnology: (1)\n\nEngineering codes, standards, guidelines and practices that apply; (2)\n\nGeneration facility type\ncertification; (3)\n\nProcedures and\ncontrols for facility inspection, testing and commissioning; and\n(4)\n\nMaintenance and management plans, procedures and criteria. (g) For facilities where it is contemplated\nthat a portion of a new interconnection substation to be built will be\ntransferred to the transmission owner: (1)\n\nDescribe the substation facilities to be transferred and the contemplated\nfuture transaction, including a timetable for the future transfer; (2)\n\nDescribe how the\nsubstation-interconnection design will meet the transmission owner's\nrequirements; and\n(3)\n\nDefine the\noperational and maintenance responsibilities for the substation and how they\nwill meet the transmission owner's standards. (h) If the applicant will entertain proposals\nfor sharing above-ground infrastructure with other utilities (communications, cable, phone, cell phone relays, and similar facilities), criteria and\nprocedures for review of such proposals. (i) A status report on equipment availability\nand expected delivery dates for major components including towers, turbines, solar panels, inverters, transformers, and related major equipment.
