  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-4.17 - Stormwater management plan requirements in areas where development is occurring\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach stormwater management plan shall, at a minimum, include the following elements for those areas where new land use and\ndevelopment, including redevelopment, is occurring or where, under applicable\nzoning or other land use controls, new land use and development may occur in\nthe future: (a) Maps of individual\nparcels and general land areas where development is occurring or may occur in\nthe future delineating the location and capacity of the existing stormwater\ninfrastructure serving those parcels or areas, including community storm-sewers\nand human-made retention and detention control structures as well as natural\nstormwater control features. Such maps shall also depict major roads, streams, watersheds, ponds, wetlands, land use zones, soil types and areas with slopes\ngenerally greater than 15 percent and delineate, within each watershed, lands\nhaving potential for use as dedicated stormwater recharge areas. The commission\nshall establish standardized map formats and uniform scales to be used by the\nmunicipalities to promote the goal of a consistent planning reference for the\npark. (b) A method for evaluating\npotential stormwater recharge areas on the basis of existing land use, soil\nprofile, slope and bedrock characteristics, and similar factors related to the\nprotection of public health and safety and the maintenance of water\nquality. (c) Measures that the\ncommunity intends to adopt to protect potential stormwater management areas so\nas to preserve such areas for treating and infiltrating stormwater runoff. These areas may be preserved and protected by fee acquisition, gifts, easements, use and density restrictions such as zoning, or other appropriate\nmethods. (d) A means of entering\ninto agreements with other municipalities to use common areas within a\nwatershed for stormwater infiltration purposes, subject to review by the\ncommission. (e) An evaluation of\nthe long-term capability to control stormwater and a description of steps, including acquisition, easement or regulatory control, proposed to be\nundertaken to protect natural stormwater control features such as streams, ponds and wetlands. (f) Proposed\namendments to existing land use planning controls, if necessary, to ensure that\npermitted development is consistent with stormwater management standards set\nforth in this Subpart.
