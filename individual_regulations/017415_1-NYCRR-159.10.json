  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 159.10 - Sampling for Acceptable Hemp THC Levels\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Sampling of Growers/Sampling Agents. (i) As currently authorized under federal law\nas an acceptable testing methodology for commercial growers, the Department or\nsampling agents certified by the Department, shall collect samples from all\nlots of the unharvested hemp plants of all growers to test for acceptable hemp\nTHC levels within 30 days of the proposed harvest date (\"pre-harvest\nsampling\"). (ii)\n\nShould the\n\nDepartment receive approval from the USDA to undertake performance-based\nsampling of growers which would eliminate the requirement to test all lots of\nall growers, the Department will seek to amend its grower sampling methodology\nto provide for performance-based sampling, where appropriate. (iii)\n\nGrowers of hemp for research and\nresearch institutions may, with the written approval of the Department, adopt\nand carry out performance-based sampling. (iv)\n\nSampling for regulatory testing for\nacceptable hemp THC levels shall be conducted either by Department inspectors\nor sampling agents approved by the Department. (v) Sampling agents shall be trained and\ncertified by the Department. (vi)\n\nAn applicant for State certification to sample hemp shall apply upon a form\nprepared by the Department, which application shall require a current criminal\nhistory report issued no more than 60 days prior to submission of the\napplication to sample hemp. (vii)\n\nThe Department shall maintain and post a list of certified sampling agents on\nits website. (viii)\n\nShould the\n\nDepartment be required to provide sampling services, the grower shall pay a\nsampling fee equal to the actual cost of procuring the sample, mailing, or\ndelivering the sample to the lab, and performing the laboratory analysis for\neach lot sampled by the Department. (ix)\n\nThe cost of sampling by a\n\nDepartment-certified sampler will be determined by agreement between the\nsampling agent and the grower. (b) Procedures for obtaining pre-harvest\nregulatory sampling. (i) The grower, using\nthe Department's pre-harvest report form, shall notify the Department of the\nanticipated date for the harvest of its hemp crop and the number of lots to be\nharvested. The preharvest report form shall be delivered to Department so that\nit arrives no less than 30 days before the anticipated harvest date. (ii)\n\nThe grower shall notify the Department\nin writing of any anticipated delay to the proposed date of harvest, which\nshall extend the time to complete the regulatory sampling by the number of days\nof the commencement of the harvest is delayed. If the harvest is delayed beyond\n30 days after a sample has been taken, a new sample must be taken and tested\nprior to harvest. (iii)\n\nPre-harvest\nsampling shall only be conducted by the Department or a Department-certified\nsampling agent. Plant material sampling by the grower or the grower's agent\ndoes not satisfy preharvest regulatory testing requirements and the plant\nmaterial generated by the grower's sampling shall not be used for the\n\nDepartment's regulatory testing sampling. (iv)\n\nThe grower shall not harvest its hemp\nuntil a Department inspector, or a Department-certified sampling agent, has\ncompleted the pre-harvest sampling of the grower's hemp or until the grower has\nreceived written approval to harvest from the Department. (v) Harvested hemp shall remain in the\npossession and control of the grower and not sold unless the testing required\nby this Part demonstrates that the lot of harvested hemp meets the acceptable\nhemp THC level and, accordingly, may enter the stream of commerce. (c) Sampling of the hemp crop. (i) The Department and the sampling agents\nshall be provided with complete and unrestricted access to the grower's\npremises during business hours, to all hemp and other hemp plants and plant\nparts, whether growing or harvested, and all land, buildings and other\nstructures used for the cultivation, handling, and storage of all hemp and\ncannabis and all locations listed in the grower's license. (ii)\n\nIf requested by the Department, the\ngrower shall provide an authorized representative of the grower to be present\nfor the scheduled sampling. (iii)\n\nThe Department's inspectors or Department-certified sampling agents shall\nsample the parts of unharvested hemp plants using a sampling method that is\nsufficient, at a confidence level of 95 percent, to conclude that no more than\none percent of the plants in the lot exceed the acceptable hemp THC level or\nsuch other sampling method that the Department believes appropriate to ensure\nthat the hemp produced by the grower does not exceed the acceptable hemp THC\nlevel. (iv)\n\nThe Department or\n\nDepartment-certified sampling agents shall sample hemp grown using a sampling\nprotocol published by the Department and posted on the Department\nwebsite. (v) The sampling protocol\nmay be amended from time to time, at the Department's discretion, provided that\nthe amended protocol is posted on the Department's website, and shall go into\neffect for the following year's growing season. (vi)\n\nSamples of the cultivated hemp for the\n\nDepartment's regulatory testing shall be obtained from the flowering tops of\nplants when flowering tops are present and shall be approximately five to eight\ninches in length from the \"main stem\" (including the leaves and flowers), \"terminal bud\" (that occurs at the end of a stem), or \"central cola\" (cut stem\nthat could develop into a bud) of the flowering top of the plant. (vii)\n\nSamples of hemp plant material from one\nlot shall not be comingled with hemp plant material from other lots. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n159.10\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 6, 2022/Volume XLIV, Issue 14, eff. 4/6/2022\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
