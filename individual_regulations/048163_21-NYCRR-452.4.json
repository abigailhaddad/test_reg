  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 452.4 - Adjustment of rates in accordance with changes in the cost of purchased power\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Municipalities\nand cooperatives purchasing their full power requirements from the Power\n\nAuthority of the State of New York may include in their resale rates an\nadjustment clause for recovery of changes in the delivered cost of purchased\npower subject to such reconciliation as the authority may deem appropriate. Municipalities or cooperatives which elect to use such an adjustment clause may\nfile statements to their rate schedules in lieu of rate revisions. Such\nstatements, which shall be in a form prescribed by the Power Authority, shall\nnot be part of the rate schedule, but a copy of each effective statement will\nbe kept available with each rate schedule to which it applies. The first such\nstatement of each municipality or cooperative shall be filed with the Power\n\nAuthority and become effective on a date specified by the authority. Thereafter, each such statement must be filed with the Power Authority not less\nthan three days prior to the date on which it is proposed to be\neffective. (b) When municipalities\nand cooperatives elect to file statements in accordance with this section, such\nstatements must contain: (1)\nidentification\nof the schedules and service classifications to which they apply; (2)\nthe present purchased power cost per KWh\nand its derivation; (3)\nthe base\npurchased power cost per KWh and its derivation; (4)\nthe difference per KWh between the\npresent purchased power cost per KWh and the base purchased power cost per\nKWh; (5)\nthe factor of ajustment\nfor distribution system efficiency; (6)\nthe purchased power adjustment per KWh\n(exclusive of any surcharge/credit per KWh) determined by applying the factor\nof adjustment for distribution system efficiency to the difference between the\nbase purchased power cost per KWh and the present purchased power cost per\nKWh; (7)\nthe surcharge/credit per\nKWh and its derivation, if utilized; (8)\nthe purchased power adjustment per KWh\n(inclusive of the surcharge/credit per KWh if utilized); (9)\nthe effective date of the increase or\ndecrease in rates. (c) In\nconnection with statements filed pursuant to this section: (1)\n\nThe term purchased power cost is defined\nas the total cost of power including transmission and wheeling charges at the\npoint of delivery to the municipal or cooperative system of electricity\npurchased from the Power Authority for resale. (2)\n\nThe base purchased power cost per KWh is\ndetermined by calculating the average cost per KWh of purchased power by\napplying the authority's wholesale, transmission and wheeling rates to billing\nquantities for a 12-month period to be determined by the authority and dividing\nthe total cost, so calculated, by KWh delivered during the period. Wholesale, transmission and wheeling rates to be used in the calculation are those which a\nspecific customer has reflected in its base retail rates. (3)\n\nThe present purchased power cost per KWh\nis determined by calculating the average cost per KWh of purchased power by\napplying the authority's current wholesale, transmission and wheeling rates to\nbilling quantities in the current billing period. (4)\n\nThe factor of adjustment for distribution\nsystem efficiency is determined by dividing the number of kilowatt hours\npurchased at the point of delivery during the recently completed fiscal year by\nthe number of kilowatt hour sales to all customers under all service\nclassifications during the same fiscal year. (5)\n\nThe surcharge/credit per KWh is\ndetermined by dividing the surcharge or credit as hereinafter described by KWh\ndelivered during the period and adjusting for distribution system efficiency. The surchargeshall be an amount approved by the Power Authority, as a function\nof an individual municipality's or cooperative's James A. FitzPatrick nuclear\npower allocation and the applicable demand charge which, at the option of the\nmunicipality or cooperative, may be applied during its peak consumption season. The surcharge shall be offset be a \"credit\" applied during the system's\noff-peak consumption season, the amount of which shall be determined monthly by\ndividing the then outstanding balance of the collected surcharge by the number\nof months remaining in the off-peak season. For purposes of this definition, the term season shall mean the authority's six-month billing period October\nthrough March or April through September. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
