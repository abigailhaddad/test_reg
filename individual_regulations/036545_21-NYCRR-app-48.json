  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 21, Appendices, app 48\n\nState Regulations\nAPPENDICES\nThe purpose of these appendices is to simplify the task of\ndetermining whether or not a proposed action will not have a significant effect\nupon the environment by identifying actions or classes of actions that are\nconsidered by the Issuer to be exempt or ministerial actions and those which, in the judgement of the Issuer, will not have a significant effect upon the\nenvironment. Because of the complex and varied nature of the Issuer's\nactions, the lists in these appendices are not all-inclusive. The omission from\nthe lists of an action does not mean that it is automatically an action\nrequiring environmental impact statement preparation. The criteria set forth in\nsection 6 NYCRR\n617.9\nand criteria included in 6 NYCRR\n617.10\nand these\nregulations shall be used to determine significance with respect to actions not\nlisted in these appendices. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. tit. 21, Appendices, app\n48\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
