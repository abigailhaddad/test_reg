Add one to the quotient to determine a class market\nvalue adjustment factor. (6)\n\nMultiply the class or portion class market value obtained pursuant to section\n1803-a (2)(a)(1)\nof the\n\nReal Property Tax Law by the appropriate class market value adjustment factor\nobtained in paragraph (5) of this subdivision.
