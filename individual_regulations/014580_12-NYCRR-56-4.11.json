  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-4.11 - Phase ii c satisfactory clearance air sample results criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) PCM clearance\ncriteria. The PCM clearance air sample results shall be considered satisfactory\nwhen every clearance air sample demonstrates an airborne concentration of\nfibers of less than 0.01 fiber per cubic centimeter, or the established\nbackground level(s), whichever is greater. (b) TEM clearance criteria. If TEM is the\nselected method of clearance air sampling and analysis, the clearance criteria\nand sampling protocols of AHERA shall be used. If PCM air sample analysis\nresults exceed the satisfactory clearance air criteria under this Part, then\nTEM analysis of the entire set of clearance air samples may be used, provided\nthat a standard accepted laboratory analysis method is used that shall report\neach air sample result in fibers per cubic centimeter, for appropriate\ncorrelation to the original unsatisfactory PCM clearance air sample results and\nthe established background level(s). When AHERA TEM air sampling protocols are\nnot used (i.e., TEM analyses of failed PCM air samples), PCM clearance criteria\napply. (c) Submission of\nsatisfactory clearance air sample results. The air sampling asbestos contractor\nshall submit to the commissioner, all satisfactory PCM clearance air sample\nresults along with background results, if they are greater than or equal to\n0.01 fiber per cubic centimeter. The air sampling asbestos contractor shall\nalso submit to the commissioner, all sets of satisfactory TEM analyses of\npreviously unsatisfactory PCM clearance air sample results, along with the\nunsatisfactory PCM results. These air sample results shall be submitted, within\ntwo business days of receipt of satisfactory clearance air results, to the\ncommissioner in care of the appropriate district office of the Asbestos Control\n\nBureau, where the project takes place. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-4.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
