  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.22 - Fuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam and like services used in production\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(c)\n(a) Exemption. (1)\n\nFuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration and\nsteam and gas, electric, refrigeration and steam service of whatever nature is\nexempt from the sales and compensating use tax when used directly and\nexclusively in the production, for sale, of tangible personal property, gas, electricity, refrigeration or steam by one of the following endeavors: (i) manufacturing; (ii)\nprocessing; (iii)\nassembling; (iv)\ngenerating; (v) refining; (vi)\nmining; or\n(vii)\nextracting. Cross-reference: See section\n528.7\n(a)(4)\nof this Part regarding fuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration, and steam, and\nlike services used in farm production or in a commercial horse boarding\noperation, or in both. (2)\n\nFuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration and\nsteam and like services used or consumed in the heating, cooling or lighting of\nbuildings or in the preparation of food and drink subject to tax imposed by\nsection\n1105 (d)\nof the Tax Law or\nin the storage of tangible personal property, are subject to the sales\ntax. (3)\n\nThere is no exemption from\nthe tax imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law, for fuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam, and like services used or consumed in\nproduction. (4)\n\nAn exempt use\ncertificate (Form ST-121) is used to make purchases eligible for this\nexemption, without payment of sales tax. (See section\n532.4\n[e]\nof this Title.)\n(b) Definitions. (1)\n\nThe term\nfuel\nas used in this section means any commodity which\nproduces heat or energy. Fuel includes wood, coal, radioactive materials and\npetroleum products except lubricants. (2)\n\nThe term\ngas\nas used in\nthis section means any gaseous substance inert or otherwise, whether taxed\nunder subdivision (a) or (b) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, used in the\nperformance of a production function or to create an atmosphere which is\nconducive to or necessary for production. (c) Directly and exclusively. (1)\n\nDirectly\nmeans the fuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam and like services, and must during\nthe production phase of a process, either: (i) operate exempt production machinery or equipment; or\n(ii)\ncreate conditions necessary for\nproduction; or\n(iii)\nperform an\nactual part of the production process. (2)\n\nUsage in activities collateral to the\nactual production process is not deemed to be use directly in production. Example 1: A welding shop produces stainless steel railings. In order\nto carry out the production, the railings must be welded in an inert\natmosphere. The welding shop purchases an inert gas which is used to create the\ninert atmosphere. The gas is used directly in production. (3)\n(i) Exclusively\nmeans that the fuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam and like services are used in total (100%) in the\nproduction process. (ii)\n\nBecause\nfuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam when purchased by the user are\nnormally received in bulk or in a continuous flow and a portion thereof is used\nfor purposes which would make the exemption inapplicable to such purchases, the\nuser may claim a refund or credit for the tax paid only on that portion used or\nconsumed directly and exclusively in production. (iii)\n\nIn the alternative, an exempt use\ncertificate (Form ST-121) may be used, providing full liability is assumed for\nany State and local tax due on any part of purchases used for other than the\nexempt purposes described in subdivision (a) of this section. The taxable\nportion of these purchases is to be reported as a \"purchase subject to use tax\"\non a sales and use tax return required to be filed with the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. (iv)\n\nThe user\nmust maintain adequate records with respect to the allocation of fuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam used directly and exclusively in\nproduction and for nonexempt purposes. (v) For the purpose of substantiating the\nallocation of fuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam and like services\nused directly and exclusively in production from that used for nonexempt\npurposes, the user must, when claiming a refund or credit, submit an\nengineering survey or the formulae used in arriving at the amounts used in an\nexempt manner. Example 2: A producer of electricity purchases fuel oil in bulk. The\noil is used both to create steam to operate turbines which produce electricity\nand to heat buildings. The oil used for steam to operate the turbines is used\ndirectly in production while the oil used to heat buildings is not used in\nproduction. Example 3: A manufacturing plant purchases electricity to power its\nproduction machinery and also to light its buildings. Only the electricity used\nto power the production machinery is used directly in production. Example 4: A food processor packages and ships t.v. dinners to a flash\nfreezing plant to process the dinners. The flash freezing of the dinners is\nrefrigeration used in production. The frozen dinners are then moved to a\nrefrigerated warehouse for storage to await sale and delivery. The refrigerated\nstorage is not refrigeration used in production. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n528.22\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
