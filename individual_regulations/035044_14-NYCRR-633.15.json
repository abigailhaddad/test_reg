(2)\n\nFunds in the personal allowance cash\naccount in the residence must be given to the person as soon as possible, but\nnot to exceed 24 hours after the person's request for the funds, consistent\nwith the money management assessment in the personal expenditure\nplan. (3)\n\nPersonal allowance that\nis under the control of the agency that is not maintained at the residence must\nbe sent to the residence as soon as possible, but not to exceed three business\ndays after receiving a duly authorized request for the funds.

In such\ncases, the expenditures shall be noted in the ledger or other record. (2)\n\nReceipts are not required for\nexpenditures made by the person from a cash distribution that he or she\nreceives from personal allowance monies. The amount of the cash distribution, however, must be noted on the ledger card or cash account record and be\nconsistent with the individual's money management assessment. (m) Restitution.
