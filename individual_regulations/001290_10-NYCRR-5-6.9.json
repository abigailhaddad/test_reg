  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 5-6.9 - Sanitizing bottles\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe bottles shall be properly sanitized before use by using approved methods and approved sanitizing agents. (a) Before filling, all multi-use containers shall be thoroughly washed in an effective cleansing agent and water solution, having a temperature not less than 120° F, followed by application of a bactericidal solution and the inside rinsed with finished product water to remove traces of sanitizing agents. (b) The bactericidal procedure for the inside of bottles, as a minimum, shall be one of the following: (1)\n\nSanitize with 100 ppm chlorine water solution at 75° F for not less than 30 seconds. (2)\n\nSanitize with a 2 1/2 percent caustic solution at a minimum temperature of 120° F followed by a rinse containing not less than 10 ppm free chlorine. Note: When caustic is discharged by high-velocity jets, this procedure shall be considered to satisfy both cleaning and bactericidal requirements. (3)\n\nSanitize with water at an inside bottle temperature of not less than 170° F for not less than 15 seconds. (4)\n\nSanitize by exposing all surfaces to a three percent caustic solution at a minimum temperature of 120° F for five minutes--by means of automatic bottle washers using high-velocity, hydro-type jets or by soaker washers--followed by a rinse containing not less than 10 ppm free chlorine. (5)\n\nOther methods equally protective of public health as the above, when approved by the State, may be used. (c) Single-use bottles or containers, which are free of all bacteria, dust, or other contamination, need not comply with the above sanitizing requirement before filling. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n5-6.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
