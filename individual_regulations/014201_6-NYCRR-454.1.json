  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 454.1 - Scope of the rules in this part\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The rules in this Part specify correction factors which are added to, or\nsubtracted from, the reading of the sound level generated by a motor vehicle, as displayed on a sound level measurement system, during the measurement of the\nmotor vehicle's sound level emissions at a test site which is not a standard\nsite. (b) The purpose of adding or\nsubtracting a correction factor is to equate the sound level reading actually\ngenerated by the motor vehicle to the sound level reading it would have\ngenerated if the measurement had been made at a standard test site.
