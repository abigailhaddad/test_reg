  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 151.11 - New York State personal income tax returns for decedents\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 651(c)\n(a) General. In general, the same rules for filing New York State\npersonal income tax returns apply to a decedent as in the case of any other\ntaxpayer. The executor or administrator of the estate of a taxpayer who died\nduring the taxable year, or any other person charged with the property of such\na decedent, must make and file a New York State personal income tax return for\nhim on the form (IT-200, IT-201 or IT-203) which would have been appropriate\nhad he lived. For the decedent's taxable year which ends with the date of his\ndeath, such return will cover the period during which he was\nalive. (b) Joint New\n\nYork State personal income tax return after death. (1)\n\nWhere one or both spouses die during the\nyear and would have been entitled to file a joint New York State personal\nincome tax return had they lived, a joint New York State personal income tax\nreturn may be made, on form IT-200, form IT-201 or form IT-203, if: (i) a joint Federal income tax return was\nmade for the taxable year; (ii)\nthe\ntaxable year of both decedents, or of the decedent and the surviving spouse (as\nthe case may be), began on the same day and ended on different days only\nbecause of the death of either or both; (iii)\nneither taxpayer was reporting for a\npart of a year as a result of a change in accounting period; and\n(iv)\nthe surviving spouse did not remarry\nbefore the end of the taxable year. (2)\n\nGenerally, the executor or administrator\nand the surviving spouse must unite in making a joint New York State personal\nincome tax return. However, where the surviving spouse, alone, is authorized by\nthe Internal Revenue Code and the Federal regulations to make a joint Federal\nincome tax return for himself and the deceased spouse, he may also make a joint\n\nNew York State personal income tax return for both.
