  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 531.3 - Basis of tax\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tangible personal property purchased at retail. (1)\n\nThe compensating use tax is due upon the\nuse in this State of tangible personal property which has been purchased out of\nstate. The applicable tax rate is imposed on the consideration given or\ncontracted to be given for the property or for the use of the property, including any charges by the seller to the user for shipping or delivery of the\nproperty to the user. Credit is allowed for tangible personal property accepted\nin part payment and intended for resale in the same manner as the computation\nof a receipt for sales tax purposes. (See section\n526.5\n[f]\nof this\n\nTitle.)\n\nExample 1: A resident of New York purchases clothing in another state. When he brings the clothing into the State, or when it is delivered by mail or\ncommon carrier to an address within the State, he is subject to\ntax. (2)\n\nThe compensating\nuse tax is due upon the use of tangible personal property, which was purchased\nfor resale or an exempt use and is subsequently withdrawn from or diverted to a\ntaxable use by the purchaser. Example 2: A retail store purchased a dozen desks at $75 each for sale\nto its customers at $125 each. It subsequently withdrew one of the desks from\ninventory to be used in its office. A compensating use tax is due for the desk\nwithdrawn from inventory. The tax is computed on the $75 the store paid. Example 3: A machine shop which produces machine tools for sale\nwithdraws from its production line a drill press for use in its building\nmaintenance shop. The drill press was originally purchased exempt from tax for\nuse in production. The use of the drill press in the building maintenance shop\nis a use subject to compensation use tax, at cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. (b) Tangible personal property\nmanufactured, processed or assembled by the user. (1)\nA compensating use tax is imposed when a\nmanufacturer, processor or assembler uses its product as such in New York State\nor incorporates the product into real property in New York State. This is so\nwhether or not it offers items of the same kind for sale in the regular course\nof business and whether the product was manufactured, processed or assembled\ninside or outside New York State. The basis on which compensating use tax is\ncomputed, however, depends on whether the user offers items of the same kind\nfor sale in the regular course of business. A compensating use tax is not\nimposed, however, to the extent the user was required to pay sales tax without\na right to a refund or credit upon the purchase of the ingredients, parts or\nmaterials manufactured, processed or assembled into the product the use of\nwhich is subject to tax. Example 1: Company A, located in Suffolk County, manufactures and\nsells its own brand of garage doors. Approximately 80 percent of the doors are\ninstalled by Company A; the balance of the doors are installed by the\npurchaser. Company A pays sales tax to its New York State suppliers of\nwood and glass that become part of the doors. When determining the amount of\nuse tax it owes Company A may take credit for the New York State and local\nsales taxes paid on these materials. (i) If the user offers items of the same kind\nfor sale in the regular course of business, the basis on which use tax is\ncomputed is the price at which items of the same kind of tangible personal\nproperty are offered for sale by the user. The price at which items are offered\nfor sale is evidenced by a price list, catalog price or record of sales. In the\nabsence of a catalog price or price list, the average of the prices charged\nvarious customers will be deemed to be the price at which the user would sell\nsuch item during the regular course of business. (a) Items of the same kind\nmean that items belong to an identifiable class, but need not be identical. Example 2: Windows are items of the same kind when they are a standard\nsize and materials whether or not they are sold from inventory or produced to\norder from a catalog description. A manufacturer of windows produces from a\ncatalog description square, round and hexagon shaped windows from various\nmaterials. The windows regardless of shape, size or materials are considered to\nbe items of the same kind. When items which are not standard or cataloged are made to\nthe specifications of a particular job, these will not be considered items of\nthe same kind with catalog or inventory sales. Items made to the specifications of a particular job will\nnot be considered items of the same kind as items made to the specifications of\nanother particular job. Example 3: An asphalt conpany produces various types of hot asphalt\nmixes known as paving compounds and cold asphalt mixes known as patching\ncompounds. The hot asphalt mixes are used by the asphalt company for permanent\npaving, cannot be packaged and must be used on the day of production. The cold\nasphalt mixes are used for temporary patchwork, can be packaged and have a\nshelf life of considerable duration. Because of these distinctions, the hot\nmixes are not considered to be items of the same kind as the cold mixes. Example 4: A manufacturer produces standard type pre-cast steps (all\nof which are installed by the manufacturer), concrete block and various\nornamental pre-cast items. For purposes of identifying items of the same kind sold by\nthis manufacturer, the three distinct types of products must be considered\nseparately. Therefore, the steps, the blocks and the ornamentals are each items\nof the same kind. (b) Offered for sale in the regular course of business\nmeans that\na person sells in excess of 10 percent of his product for each 12 month period\nbeginning December 1st, measured by weight, volume, size or other unit on which\nthe price is based, to persons other than organizations exempt under section\n1116 (a)\nof the Tax Law. For the purpose of this calculation, the amount of\nproduct sold to all persons except exempt organizations will constitute the\nnumerator of the fraction and the total amount of the product sold and used in\nperforming work for others, with the exclusion of products sold to or used in\nperforming work for exempt organizations, will constitute the denominator. When\nit is determined that a person is selling in excess of 10 percent of his\nproduct in the regular course of business as defined herein, he will be\nconsidered a person required to pay compensating use tax on the basis set forth\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. The formula to be used in determining\nwhether tha product is being sold in the regular course of business is: Tot. amt. sold minus amt. sold to exempt\norganizations\n_____________________\nTot. amt. sold and used minus (amt. sold to plus amt. used\nfor ex. organ.)\n\nExample 5: An asphalt company produces paving compounds for its own\nuse and sells production overruns to the public by the ton. The total amount\nused and sold in a reporting period is 100,000 tons broken down as\nfollows: 65,000\ntons used in non-exempt contracts\n20,000\ntons used in exempt contracts\n12,000\ntons sold to non-exempt customers\n3,000\ntons sold to exempt organizations\n100,000\ntons\n\nUsing the formula set forth above to determine whether or\nnot the producer is offering paving compounds for sale in the regular course of\nbusiness yields this equation: 15,000 3,000\n/\n100,000\n(20,000 + 3,000)\n=\n12,000\n/\n77,000\n= 15.6%\nSince the result is more than 10 percent, the producer is\nregularly engaged in selling paving compounds. Example 6: A manufacturer of pre-stressed concrete beams uses them in\nthe erection of buildings. It uses and sells 100,000 square feet of the beams\nduring a reporting period. The following information needed to determine\nwhether it is selling in the regular course of business is extracted from its\nrecords. Use in non-exempt contracts\n80,000 sq. ft. Used in exempt contracts\n15,000 sq. ft. Sold to non-exempt customers\n5,000 sq. ft. Sold to exempt customers\n-0-\nTotal used and sold\n100,000 sq. ft. A percentage is computed from this fraction: 5,000 0\n/\n100,000\n15,000\n=\n5,000\n/\n85,000\n= 5.9%\nSince the percent arrived at is less than 10 percent, the\nmanufacturer is not engaged in selling pre-stressed concrete beams in the\nregular course of business. (c) The following examples illustrates the\nprinciples set forth in this subparagraph. Example 7: A desk manufacturer withdraws desks from its inventory for\nuse in its executive office. In the reguar course of business it sells the desk\nfo $150. It pays a compensating use tax on $150, the price at which it sells\nsuch desks. Example 8: The asphalt company in Example 5 will be required to pay a\ncompensating use tax on 65,000 tons of production on the basis of the price at\nwhich it sold such compounds to other people in the regular course of business\nand at the tax rate in effect at the job location in New York State where the\nasphalt is installed. It will also be required to collect the sales tax on the\n12,000 tons of production sold to corporations, unless such corporations\nprovide direct payment permits or properly completed exemption certificates. As\n20,000 tons were used for incorporation into real property of exempt\norganizations, the asphalt company need not pay a tax on that portion of the\nproduction. As 3,000 tons of the production were sold to exempt organizations, the company need not collect a tax on those sales. Example 9: A steel company manufactures beams for sale to others and\nfor use itself in contracting jobs. It sells over 50 percent of its production\nto nonexempt persons, and is required to pay a use tax on the steel it uses. Its catalog lists 12-foot steel beams of a certain size at $35. It uses 100 of\nthese beams in erecting a new building for a corporation in New York State. It\npays a tax at the rate in effect where the 100 beams are installed on the basis\nof $35 per beam. Example 10: An asphalt company, in the regular course of business sells\nits products to others. It has no price list or catalog. It sells the following\nto others in a reporting period: Type \"A\" 700 tons at $5\n$3,500\n\nType \"A\" 400 tons at $6\n2,400\n\nTotal 1,100 tons\n$5,900\n\nType \"B\" 700 tons at $6\n$4,200\n\nType \"B\" 200 tons at $7\n1,400\n\nType \"B\" 500 tons at $5\n2,500\n\nTotal 1,400 tons\n$8,100\n\nThe average price per ton in the case of Type A asphalt is\n$5.36 and the average price per ton for Type B asphalt is $5.79. These are the\nprices at which the company pays a compensating use tax on any Type A and Type\nB asphalt which it uses for construction work it performs for nonexempt\npersons. (d) The mere\nstorage, keeping, retention or withdrawal from storage of tangible personal\nproperty by the person who manufactured, processed or assembled it is not a\ntaxable use for purposes of this subparagraph. (ii)\n\nIf the user does not offer items of the\nsame kind for sale in the regular course of business as described in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the basis on which use tax is computed is\nthe consideration given or contracted to be given for the tangible personal\nproperty manufactured, processed or assembled into the tangible personal\nproperty the use of which is subject to tax, including any charges by the\nuser's seller to the user for shipping or delivery of that property to the\nuser. Example 11: An asphalt company, located in Ohio, produces paving\ncompounds for its own use in performing capital improvement contracts and\nrepairs for others. It sells none of its product to others. It purchased\naggregate and petroleum base materials in Ohio from other vendors. It will be\nrequired to pay a use tax on the cost of those materials to the extent not used\non exempt organization jobs. The tax rate applicable is the rate in effect in\n\nNew York State where the asphalt is installed. Example 12: Company A produces factory manufactured homes at its plant\nin Vermont. The components are manufactured in Vermont and the homes are\nshipped in sections to customer prepared sites where Company A erects the home. Company A only sells its product on an installed basis. It does not sell the\nindividual components. Company A owes use tax on the individual building\ncomponents manufactured at its plant in Vermont which were used in erecting\nhomes of customers in New York. The use tax is based on the cost to Company A\nof the raw materials it used to manufacture the building components. The tax\ndue is computed by multiplying the cost of the raw materials by the tax rate in\neffect at the site in New York where the home is erected. (2)\n(i) Where a manufacturer, processor or\nassembler fabricates its manufactured, processed or assembled product and\ninstalls it to the specifications of a capital improvement to real property, the value added by this fabrication is not included in the basis on which\ncompensating use tax is computed. However, the installation by the\nmanufacturer, processor or assembler of its fabricated product to the\nspecifications of a capital improvement to real property is a use of the\nproduct subject to compensating use tax. The basis on which the use tax is\ncomputed depends on whether the manufacturer, processor or assembler offers its\nfabricated product for sale in the regular course of business. (ii)\n\nWhere a manufacturer, processor or\nassembler offers its fabricated product for sale in the regular course of\nbusiness, the use tax is computed based on the price the manufacturer, processor or assembler would charge an unrelated contractor for the product\nprior to fabrication. Example 13: Assume the manufacturer in Example 9 takes a standard beam\nand fabricates it to the specifications of a particular project. Upon use of\nthe fabricated beam it pays a compensating use tax on the price at which it\nsells similar unfabricated beams to others. (iii)\n\nIf the manufacturer, processor or\nassembler does not offer its fabricated product for sale in the regular course\nof business, the basis on which use tax is computed is the consideration given\nor contracted to be given for the tangible personal property manufactured, processed or assembled into the tangible personal property the use of which is\nsubject to tax, including any charges by the user's seller to the user for\nshipping or delivery of the raw material to the user. Example 14: Assume the manufacturer in Example 12 performs fabrication\nservices on a section of the home of one of its New York customers. The use tax\nis still based on the cost to Company A of the raw materials used to\nmanufacture the building components. The value added by the fabrication service\nperformed by Company A is not subject to tax. (iv)\n\nWhere tangible personal property is\npurchased out of state to be fabricated and installed to the specifications of\na capital improvement in New York State, and the fabrication of such property\nis done by the user, the value added to the property as a result of the\nfabrication is not included in the basis on which compensating use tax is\ncomputed. The use tax in such case is based on the consideration given or\ncontracted to be given for the property, as provided in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, including any charges by the seller to the user for shipping or\ndelivery of the property to be fabricated to the user. If the user does not\nfabricate the property but purchases fabrication services performed on the\nproperty out of state, the consideration given or contracted to be given for\nsuch fabrication service will be included in the basis on which compensating\nuse tax is computed, as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (c)\nof this section, including any charges by the seller to the user for shipping\nor delivery of the property to the user. Example 15: A contractor, located in Pennsylvania, purchases a steel\nbeam from a manufacturer in Pennsylvania. The contractor fabricates the beam to\nthe specifications of a job in Buffalo, New York. Upon installation of the\nfabricated beam the contractor will owe use tax on the amount paid for the\nbeam. However, the value added by the fabrication services performed by the\ncontractor is not subject to tax. Example 16: A contractor, located in Pennsylvania, purchases a steel\nbeam from a manufacturer in Pennsylvania. The contractor arranges for a\nfabricator in Pennsylvania to fabricate the beam to the specifications of a job\nin Buffalo, New York. Upon installation of the beam by the contractor in New\n\nYork, the contractor will owe use tax on the amount paid for the beam. The\ncontractor will also owe use tax on the amount paid for the fabrication service\nbecause the fabrication service was purchased by the contractor from a provider\nof such service. (3)\n\nThe compensating use tax computed to be\ndue shall be paid on each quarterly or part quarterly return based on the\nexperience in the period for which the return is due. A schedule shall be\nattached to the return for the quarter ending November 30th of each year for\nthe year beginning the prior December 1st, for the purpose of determining\nwhether, on an annual basis, the user offered his product for sale in the\nregular course of business, as defined in clause (\nb\n) of\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision. An adjustment shall be\nmade on such return for the tax due for the year ending November 30th, together\nwith the appropriate payment or request for refund or credit. (c) Services and tangible\npersonal property upon which services were performed. (1)\n\nThe compensating use tax is due upon the\nuse of information services and the services of collecting, compiling or\nanalyzing information. (See section\n527.3\nof this Title.)\n(2)\n\nThe compensating use tax is due upon the\nuse of property, however acquired, where not acquired for resale, upon which\nthe services of producing, fabricating, processing, printing, imprinting, installing, maintaining, servicing or repairing have been performed, including\nany charges by the seller to the user for shipping or delivery of the property\non which the taxable service is performed. (See section\n527.4\nof this Title.)\n\nExample: A firm purchases preprinted sales contracts for use in its\nbusiness. It then sends the contracts to a printer, located outside of New York\n\nState, so the firm's name and address may be imprinted on the contracts. The\nprinter does not collect the New York sales tax on his printing charge. The\nprinting charges are subject to the use tax when the contracts are returned to\nthis State. (3)\n\nThe\napplicable tax rate is imposed on the consideration given or contracted to be\ngiven for the service and for any tangible personal property transferred in\nconjunction with the service. Such consideration includes any charges by the\nseller to the user for shipping or delivery of the tangible personal property\nto the user. Similarly, charges by a provider of taxable services to a customer\nfor picking up the customer's property upon which taxable services are to be\nperformed are part of the consideration subject to tax.
