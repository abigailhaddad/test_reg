  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 285.4 - Powers of board\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nboard of inquiry shall have power, and is authorized through its chairman, to\nrequire any person who appears to the board to have any knowledge of the\nsubject matter of the inquiry to furnish in writing, or otherwise, such\nparticulars in relation thereto as the board may require. (b) A board of inquiry shall have power, within the limits of its reference, to subpoena witnesses, compel their\nattendance; administer oaths, examine any person under oath; to take testimony, and to compel any person to subscribe his testimony after it has been correctly\nreduced to writing; to require the production of books, papers, documents, records, correspondence or evidence relevant to the inquiry; and to take or\ncause to be taken depositions of witnesses residing within or without the\n\nState, in the manner prescribed by law for like depositions in actions in the\n\nSupreme Court. (c) In proceedings\nbefore a board of inquiry the board shall have power to exclude evidence which\nis immaterial, irrelevant, unduly repetitious, or not of the sort on which\nresponsible persons are accustomed to rely in serious affairs; and it shall not\nbe bound by the technical rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law and\nequity. The function of a board of inquiry is primarily investigatory and not\nquasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. But the board shall have power to include\nrecommendations in its report if the terms of reference creating the board so\nprovide. (d) A board shall have the\npower to confer with and obtain information and reports from any other agencies\nthat may have interceded in a dispute (Board of Mediation; United States\n\nConciliation Service; National or State Labor Relations Boards; mayor's office; etc.). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n285.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
