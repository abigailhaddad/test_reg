Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.5 - Disposition of investments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Investments which are held to maturity present no particular accounting\nproblems on maturity. The proceeds, representing face value, will be credited, when received, to the applicable investment account through the cash receipts\nregister. During the holding period, except for U.S. Treasury bills, for which\nsee section\n1645-2.3, supra, the purchase price will have been adjusted to face value at maturity through\nthe periodic amortization of premium or discount. Interest will also have been\naccrued to the date of maturity, except for U.S. Treasury bills, the credit for\nthe interest payment received, on maturity, going to account 1144, Accrued\n\nInterest Receivable. (b) Investments sold prior to the date of maturity, as duly authorized by\nresolution of the local agency, present other elements to be accounted for. These elements, some or all of which will be present in cash sales transaction, and the accounting treatment of each element are as follows: Element\n\nAccounting\ntreatment\n\nSales price\n\nCredit to the appropriate account in the 1170, Investments, group of accounts.

Charge or credit\naccount 2512, Gain or Loss on Reserve Fund Investments. (c) Whether the investments have been sold at\na price expressed in terms of yield or a stated amount per $1,000 face value, the statement of the bank or broker handling the transaction will give the\nsales price in dollars. The statement will also give, separately, the accrued\ninterest (to the date of disposition) sold and the expense of disposition, if\nany. The remarks made in section\n1645-2.2\nin connection with the\nexpenses of acquisition and the avoidance of broker's commissions by dealing\ndirectly with banks are also applicable to the expenses of disposition. Reference should also be made to section\n1645-2.2\nfor an explanation of the\ndate of disposition, which is controlling with respect to the accrued interest\nsold and the premium or discount amortized. Gain or loss on disposition is\ndefined as the difference between the book value of the investment, as of the\ndate of disposition, and the sales price. Gain or loss on disposition of\ndevelopment fund investments is charged or credited to account 1480, Other\n\nCharges and Credits to Development Costs, whether the sale was made prior or\nsubsequent to the date of substantial completion. Gain or loss on the\ndisposition of reserve fund investments is considered a gain or loss on the\ndisposition of replacement reserve investments, notwithstanding that the\ninvestment may actually have been for the account of some other\nreserve. (d) To illustrate the\nanalysis of a transaction for the sale of investments and the entries to the\naccounts affected, assume that $10,000 face value of bonds, maturing July 1, 1962, were bought as a replacement reserve investment on March 1, 1955, at a\nprice of 103. The interest rate on the bonds is two and one-half per cent, the\ninterest payment dates being January 1 and July 1. The bonds were sold on\n\nOctober 1, 1955, at a price of 102 1/2 and the local agency received $10,285.04\nfrom the bank handling the transaction, representing the net proceeds of the\nsale, for deposit in the reserve fund. An analysis of the bank's statement\nshows that the net proceeds were arrived at, as follows: Sales price of bonds-$10,000 face value at\n1021/2\n$10,250.00\n\nAdd: Interest accrued from July 1, 1955, the last\ninterest payment date to the date of disposition\n62.50\n$10,312.50\n\nDeduct: Expenses of disposition\n27.46\n\nNet proceeds of sale\n$10,285.04\n\nThe entry to record the transaction is made through the\ncash receipts register as follows: Entry (2): Debit: Account 1113, Reserve Fund\n$10,285.04\n\nDebit: Account 2511, Interest Earned on Reserve\n\nFund Investments\n$27.46\n\nCredit: Account 1176, Reserve Fund\n\nInvestments\n$10,250.00\n\nCredit: Account 1144, Accrued Interest Receivable\nof Investments\n$62.50\n\nGain or loss on disposition of this\ninvestment is computed, as follows: Purchase price ($10,000 face value, at 103)\n$10,300.00\n\nLess: Premium amortized to date of disposition\n(7/64 of $300)\n32.81\n\nBook value of investment at date of disposition, as reflected in investment account\n$10,267.19\n\nSales price ($10,000 face value at 1021/2)\n10,250.00\n\nLoss on disposition of investment\n($17.19)\n\nThe entry to record the loss on disposition is made by\na journal voucher, as follows: Entry (3): Debit: Account 2512, Gain or Loss on Reserve Fund\n\nInvestments\n$16.75\n\nCredit: Account 1176, Reserve Fund\n\nInvestments\n$16.75\n\nExplanation: To record the loss\non disposition of $10,000 face value U.S. Treasury bonds, 1962/60, computed, as\nfollows: Sales price\n$10,250.00\n\nBook value at date of disposition\n10,266.75\n\nLoss on disposition\n($16.75)\n\nNote that, in recording gain or loss on disposition of\ninvestments, the applicable investment account is credited directly for a loss\nand charged for a gain.
