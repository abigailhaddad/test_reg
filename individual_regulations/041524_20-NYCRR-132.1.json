Tit. 20 § 132.1 - New York adjusted gross income of a nonresident individual\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 632(a)\n(a) Items included in New York adjusted\ngross income. The New York adjusted gross income of a nonresident\nindividual includes all items of income, gain, loss and deductions which enter\ninto his Federal adjusted gross income; limited, however, to the portions of\nsuch items derived from or connected with New York State sources as determined\nunder sections\n132.2\nthrough\n132.11\nof this Part. In addition to the items realized directly by him, it includes\n(1) his distributive share of partnership income, gain, loss and deduction (see\n\nPart 137 of this Article), and (2) his share of estate or trust income, gain, loss and deduction (see Part 139 of this Article). The items thus determined\nare subject to the same modifications as are applicable for a resident\nindividual under Part 112 of this Title. Example: A, a nonresident, receives during 1980 the following\nitems of income: 1. Income from salary as a corporate officer paid in\n\nNew York State by check on a New York City bank. For 1980, 20 percent of A's\nworking days were properly considered days worked outside of New York\n\nState. $10,000\n2. Distributive share of income from a partnership\ncarrying on business as a manufacturer's representative both within and without\n\nNew York State: 70 percent of the income of the partnership was properly\nallocable to New York State. $35,000\n3. Net rental income from an apartment house located\nin New Jersey. $ 3,000\n4. A's share as beneficiary under a trust under the\nwill of A's father, who died a resident of New York State. Income of the trust\nconsists of: Net rentals from medical office building located in New York\n\nCity. $ 4,000\n\nDividends from stock of a New York State\ncorporation. $ 6,000\nA's share as 50-percent beneficiary. $ 5,000\n\nThe net amount of A's items of income\nand gain entering into his Federal adjusted gross income derived from or\nconnected with New York State sources is determined as follows: 1.

Income from New Jersey apartment house (entirely\nexcluded) (see section\n132.3\nof this Part). -0-\n4.

The modifications of Federal adjusted gross income\ndescribed in sections\n112.2\n-112.5 and 112.7-112.9 of this Title which are made by a resident individual in\ndetermining his New York adjusted gross income are also made by a nonresident\nindividual when the modifications relate to income (gain or loss) derived from\n\nNew York State sources. Modifications of a nonresident individual include\nmodifications which relate to his share of partnership income derived from or\nconnected with New York State sources (see Part 137 of this Article) and his\nshare of \"net change\" from New York State sources from an estate or trust (see\n\nPart 139 of this Article). Example: B, a nonresident, is a partner in a partnership engaged\nin the securities business as a broker and dealer holding all of its securities\nfor sale to customers in the ordinary course of business and not as\ninvestments. All of the partnership's business is carried on in New York State. B's distributive share of partnership income for 1977 includes the following\nitems of income and deduction: Interest income on obligations of states other\nthan New York\n$2,000\n\nNew York State unincorporated business income tax\nof the partnership, deducted in determining B's distributive share of income of\nthe partnership for Federal income tax purposes\n$ 250\n\nInterest or indebtedness incurred by the\npartnership to carry United States government bonds\n$ 100\n\nInterest on United States government bonds\n$1,000\n\nInterest and dividends on securities of limited\ndividend housing companies organized under New York State law\n$ 100\n\nRefund of New York State unincorporated business\nincome taxes which were deducted for Federal income tax purposes in determining\nthe distributive shares of taxable income of the partnership for a prior\ntaxable year, and which are included in partnership income for Federal income\ntax purposes\n$ 100\n\nSince the partnership carried on its business\nentirely in New York State, all of the foregoing items are derived from or\nconnected with New York State sources. Accordingly, the following modifications\nare made in determining B's New York adjusted gross income: Modifications increasing Federal adjusted\ngross income: Interest income on obligations of states other\nthan New York\n$2,000\n\nNew York State unincorporated business income tax\nof the partnership, deducted in determining B's distributive share of income of\nthe partnership for Federal income tax purposes\n$ 250\n\nInterest on indebtedness incurred by the\npartnership to carry United States government bonds\n$ 100\n\nTotal modifications increasing Federal adjusted\ngross income\n$2,350\n\nModifications reducing Federal adjusted\ngross income: Interest on United States government bonds\n$1,000\n\nInterest and dividends on securities of limited\ndividend housing companies organized under New York State law\n$ 100\n\nRefund of New York State unincorporated business\nincome taxes which were deducted for Federal income tax purposes in determining\nthe distributive shares of taxable income of the partnership for a prior\ntaxable year, and which are included in partnership income for Federal income\ntax purposes\n$ 100\n\nTotal modifications reducing Federal adjusted\ngross income\n$1,200\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
