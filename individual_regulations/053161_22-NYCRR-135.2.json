(c) On each succeeding\nanniversary of the creation of the bank, the Chief Administrator or his or her\ndesignee may require each participant to contribute up to seven additional\nhours of sick leave time, in the manner as set forth in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, upon a finding that the bank requires further accruals of sick leave\ncredits for the program to remain viable.
