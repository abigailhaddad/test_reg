  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.46 - Intersection Warning Signs (W2-1 through W2-8)\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraph 04. INSERT the following paragraphs: Guidance: 00A The use of Intersection Warning signs should be limited\nto intersections where there is insufficient visibility, or where motorists\nmust exercise more than normal caution. Support: 00B Sight distance between vehicles approaching and\nvehicles waiting at an intersection is a basic consideration in determining the\nneed for an Intersection Warning sign. However, accident experience and other\nfactors, such as unusual geometry, are also important considerations. Engineering judgment should prevail in determining the need for Intersection\n\nWarning signs. Guidance: 00C Figure 2C-101 should be used as a guide in deciding if\nan Intersection Warning sign should be installed. It expresses the significance\nof intersection visibility in terms of sight distance along the highway and\n85th percentile approach speed. Standard: 00D A plotted point in the red area below the lower curve\nindicates an intersection approach with critically limited sight distance, and\nan Intersection Warning sign shall be used except at otherwise specified in\nthis section. Guidance: 00E A plotted point in the white area above the upper curve\nindicates an intersection approach with more than adequate sight distance, and, except where unusual conditions require otherwise, an Intersection Warning sign\nshould not be used. Option: 00F A plotted point in the yellow area between the upper\nand lower curves indicates an intersection approach that has less than\ndesirable sight distance, but is not critically limited, and an Intersection\n\nWarning sign may be used where other factors indicate a need. Option: 01A The Side Road (NYW2-8) symbol sign (see Sign Drawing\nSD-W2) may be installed in advance of an intersection where the side road\nenters the main roadway at an acute angle. Option: 03A An educational plaque (see Figure 2C-9) with the legend\nROUNDABOUT (W16- 17P) may be mounted below a Circular Intersection symbol\nsign. Standard: 03B The TRAFFIC CIRCLE (W16-12p) plaque shall not be used\non an approach to a roundabout in New York. Guidance: 08A Intersection Warning signs should not ordinarily be\nused on intersection approaches where Junction or Advance Route Turn assemblies\n(see Sections 2D.30 and 2D.31) or Destination signs (see Section\n2D.37\n) are used. Guidance: 09A The W2-1 sign should be used where two roads intersect\nfrom opposite sides and the distance between the intersections is less than 30\nfeet. The W2-7 sign should be used where the distance between intersections is\n30 to 250 feet. Where the distance between the intersections is more than 250\nfeet, the intersections should be considered independently and, if appropriate, signed separately. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.46\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
