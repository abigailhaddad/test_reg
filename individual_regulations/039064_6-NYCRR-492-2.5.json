  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 492-2.5 - Payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Installment\npayments of the State grant will be made at the request of the municipality, and will be based on the cost of the work performed, materials and equipment\nsupplied and incorporated in, and services rendered in connection with, an\napproved project. (b) If the\nmunicipality fails to comply with any of the requirements of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law or regulations of the Department applicable to the project, the Department may withhold all or part of further payments pending\ncompliance. (c) Upon notification\nfrom the municipality that the project is complete, the Department will\ndetermine if the project is operating in accordance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The cost of any work completed after the final determination, or\nafter a date established by the Department at the final determination, will not\nbe considered part of the project cost. (d) A final payment, which brings the total\nof State grant payments to 100 percent of the State share of the project cost, will be released upon determination by the Department that the project is\ncomplete and is operating satisfactorily, and that all grant requirements have\nbeen met. If the project is complete but not operating satisfactorily, the\n\nDepartment may withhold from the final payment an amount sufficient, in the\njudgment of the Department, to ensure correction of deficiencies. The amount\nwithheld will be released when deficiencies are corrected. (e) Total grant payments may not exceed the\n\nState share of either the estimated reasonable cost or the actual project cost, whichever is lower after deducting any other State or Federal funds received or\nto be received for the project.
