(2)\nmore energy-efficient, or minor modifications to, heating or air conditioning equipment or systems\nusing less than five million Btu's per hour; (3)\nmore energy-efficient, or minor\nmodifications to, conventional refrigeration equipment, motors, compressors, pumps, or fans; (4)\nmore\nenergy-efficient, or minor modifications to, heat exchangers, recuperators, heat pipes, heat wheels, or mechanical heat pumps of less than 10 million Btu's\nper hour heat recovery; (5)\nminor\nnew devices, instrumentation, or equipment for measuring or monitoring air or\nwater quality at existing facilities; (6)\nblowers, pumps, fans, air diffusers, dewatering apparatus, heat pumps, or other comparable energy-saving equipment\nfor water or sewage treatment works, or the minor alteration of the related\nexisting structures, buildings, or facilities involving no expansion of use\nbeyond that previously existing; (7)\nsafety or health protective devices for\nuse during construction of, or in conjunction with, structures, facilities, or\nmechanical equipment; (8)\ninsulation, weatherstripping, storm windows, submeters, load management\nsystems, or similar energy conservation measures; (9)\ncomputer programs; (10)\nminor equipment additions for separating\ncomponents, or mechanically changing the shape or form, of nonhazardous solid\nwaste at existing resource recovery facilities, provided that any installation\nand demonstration is limited to minor equipment modifications of an existing\nsystem for source separation or mechanical change of shape or form; (11)\npassive solar and solar-electric\ntechniques in existing buildings, but not including additions to the building\nor solar-electric installations of more than 4,000 square feet; (12)\nlocal traffic control systems; (13)\nclosed-cycle earth heat exchange systems\nproducing less than one million Btu's per hour; (14)\nminor new devices for electrical\ninterconnection of existing wind turbines, cogeneration equipment, electric\nvehicle charging or photovoltaic energy systems, having an installed generating\ncapacity of five megawatts or less, with existing transmission or distribution\nfacilities; (15)\nprocess controls\nor control systems that do not result in increased emissions or production of\nwastes, such as computer hardware or software, programmable controllers, robots, or related automation equipment; (16)\nmechanical technologies, such as filters\nor membranes, for separating liquids or gases for purposes of recovering or\nrecycling components, energy, or water in connection with existing\nfacilities; (17)\nfully or\nsemi-automated laser, other electrically powered, lighting, hot-air, infrared, or lamination technologies for materials cutting, spot heating, or treating in\nmanufacturing operations; (18)\nminor new devices, instrumentation, or equipment, but not including the\nconstruction of towers, for measuring or monitoring the performance of an\noperation, process, or system or to support remote or wireless\ncommunications; (19)\nengines or\nfuel cells producing no more than 200 kilowatts that either use existing fuel\nsupplies or involve new fuel storage supplies of not more than 500\nliters; (b) sampling and\nanalytically evaluating nonradioactive or nonhazardous solids, liquids, or\ngases such as biogas, coal wastes, ash, sewage sludge, wood, or other biomass\nmaterials, when no more than 100 grams or one liter of material is required per\nanalysis; (c) operating a sewage or\nindustrial waste treatment plant to test chemical, physical, or biological\nconcepts for the treatment of such wastes when no more than 20 percent of full\nscale system flow is being treated or controlled and the effluent from the test\nequipment is returned to the full scale treatment or control system for further\ntreatment or control; (d) laboratory\ntesting of chemical, physical, and biological concepts for the treatment or\ncontrol of nonhazardous municipal, utility, business, or industrial wastes, or\nother nonhazardous materials when a reactor volume of no more than 100 liters\nis used; (e) administering or\nmanaging routine or continuing agency activities, including but not limited to\nthe execution of personal service or consulting contracts, which do not include\nnew programs or the major reordering of priorities; (f) performing administrative support or\nconsulting service functions consisting of: (1)\nproviding technical assistance or advice\nto other government agencies or the private sector; (2)\ncommenting on legislation or regulations\nproposed by government agencies; (3)\nexecuting routine contracts for printing, equipment maintenance, or office supplies, or purchase contracts for minor new\nequipment; (4)\nestablishing rates, charges, or fees for services, facilities, or products of the authority other\nthan rates, charges, or fees for disposal of low-level radioactive\nwaste; (5)\nestablishing reporting\nrequirements; (6)\nproviding\ntraining, seminars, or other informational or educational services; or\n(7)\nperforming other comparable\nadministrative or consulting service activities; (g) preparing and executing leases in which\nthe authority is either the lessee or lessor, which involve the lease of less\nthan 100 contiguous acres of land and only structures (if any) existing at the\ntime of the lease, when there is to be no material change in use; (h) approving an inducement resolution or\nother similar official action for purposes of the Federal Internal Revenue Code\n(not including any authorizing resolution) for potential financing for sewage\nfacilities, solid waste disposal facilities, facilities for the local\nfurnishing of electric energy or gas, local district heating or cooling\nfacilities, qualified hazardous waste facilities, or special energy\nprojects; (i) approving an\nauthorizing resolution providing for the issuance by the authority of its\nbonds, notes, commercial paper, or other obligations (bonds) to refund\nobligations previously issued by the authority; (j) performing minor interior or exterior\nalterations of existing structures, buildings, or facilities, such as\nwarehouses, garages, service buildings, residences, roads, or parking lots, or\nmechanical, electrical, or plumbing equipment contained therein, involving\nnegligible or no expansion of use beyond that previously existing; (k) conducting landscaping, groundskeeping, or similar activities that may alter or temporarily disturb the surface of\nland, but which will have negligible or no permanent adverse effect, such as\nminor soil grading, seeding, planting, or paving; (l) conducting energy audits; (m) sponsoring energy fairs, passive solar\ndesign competitions, or other similar activities; (n) collecting, organizing, and analyzing\ninformation, including basic data collection and research, masterplan study\ncomponents, water quality or pollution studies, traffic counts, engineering\nstudies, boring studies, surveys, or soils studies that do not commit the\nauthority to undertake, fund, or approve any Type I or unlisted\naction;
