  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1858.2 - Rules applicable to proceedings\n\nState Regulations\n\nProcess Calendar\n\nThe Process Calendar is called every Thursday. When a\nholiday falls on a Thursday, the calendar is called on Wednesday of the same\nweek. Service of Process and Proof of\n\nService\n1. Motions must be made\nreturnable every week on the day on which the process calendar is called. Counsel must check with the clerk of the court as to the appropriate date to be\nentered for return of notice of motion prior to serving and filing. Any motion\nnoticed with an incorrect date will be returned to counsel and not placed on\nthe calendar until the correct date is inserted on the notice of motion and\nserved on all respondents. Oral argument is required on all motions. 2. Where service of process is permitted by\ncertified or registered mail, there is no need to file a signed return receipt\nunless directed by the court. The affidavit of service, however, must include a\nstatement that the mailing was not returned to the sender as undeliverable. Pleadings and Papers Filed with\n\nCourt\n1. Any pleading, or paper\nsupplemental thereto (\ne.g., waiver and consent, renunciation, affidavit, etc.) that is dated more than six months prior to date of filing is\nconsidered stale and will not be accepted for filing by the court. 2. No party in interest in a proceeding can\nact as a notary for any papers filed in the proceeding. Trials\n\nThe calendar for the trial of contested proceedings is\ncalled every Monday. When a holiday falls on a Monday, the calendar is called\non Tuesday of the same week. Self-Represented Petitioners\n\nAll self-represented petitioners for letters\ntestamentary must be personally interviewed by the Chief Clerk, Deputy Chief\n\nClerk, or one of their designees, prior to filing their petition with the\ncourt. Probate Department\n1. Personal appearance and examination under\noath by the clerk must be had of any witness to a will offered for probate that\nwas executed within 90 days of the date of the decedent's death. Where all the\nparties in interest in the proceeding are adult and competent and sign an\nacknowledged waiver and consent to entry of the will to probate, the court will\ndispense with this requirement. 2. When a probate proceeding is marked for decree subject to examination of\nsubscribing witnesses, such examination shall be conducted on the date set on\nthe return date of process or, if no date has been set, then within 90 days of\nthe return date, or else objections will be deemed waived. The time provided\nfor by statute for filing objections after completion of the examination of\nsubscribing witnesses may be extended by stipulation of counsel filed with the\ncourt and so ordered. 3. A petition\nrequesting leave to extend preliminary letters beyond 180 days must be\naccompanied by a cash flow statement detailing the assets marshaled and claims\npaid by the petitioner. Any discrepancy between the value of estate assets set\nforth in the cash flow statement and the original petition for probate requires\nthe filing of an affidavit explaining the discrepancy. If leave for extension\nis granted, preliminary letters will be extended for an additional 180 days. Administration Department\n1. In order to dispense with the necessity of\na bond pursuant to SCPA 805, the petitioner for letters of administration must\nnot only submit the unanimous, acknowledged consent of all distributees, but\nalso a copy of a\npaid\nfuneral bill. 2. In a proceeding under SCPA Article 13, the\ncourt may require submission of a third party affidavit of kinship if it is\nalleged that the petitioner is the sole distributee of the decedent. 3. The certificate of letters of voluntary\nadministration issued pursuant to SCPA Article 13 will specifically identify\nthe alleged assets of an estate on its face, e.g., bank name\nand account number, and will limit the right of the voluntary administrator to\nmarshal only such identified assets. Exempt Property for Benefit of Family - EPTL\n5-3.1\n\nCertificates may be issued to a spouse, or children\nunder the age of 21 years of the decedent, identifying exempt property set\nforth in EPTL 5-3.1, when necessary. Accounting Department\n1. A copy of the account must be served with\nthe citation on all parties interested in the account. Proof of service must\nreflect service of both citation and account, as must any waiver and consent\nsigned by a party. Expenses for photocopies and mailings of the account and\ncitation shall be allowed as a legal disbursement. 2. General language approving the account, or\ncompromise and account, shall not be permitted in a waiver and consent signed\nby a party. A waiver and consent by a residuary legatee or distributee is not\nacceptable unless it specifically consents to every prayer for relief set forth\nin the petition and citation. All other interested parties need only\nspecifically consent to relief which affects their interest. 3. Where real property is sold by a\nfiduciary, only the sum equal to the net proceeds of sale is to be included in\n\nSchedule A of the account, and a copy of the closing statement is to be\nsubmitted with the account. All expenses incurred in connection with the sale\n(\ne.g., RPT tax, broker's commissions, attorney's fees, etc.)\nand the satisfaction of outstanding liens (\ne.g., mortgage, Parking Violation Bureau judgments, etc.), must be deducted from the gross sale\nprice prior to entry in Schedule A. 4. A petition for permission to sell real\nproperty, pursuant to SCPA Article 19, must be accompanied by a copy of the\ncontract of sale and a current appraisal of the subject property. 5. A petition to fix and determine attorney's\nfees, pursuant to SCPA 2110, must allege the specific dollar amount of the fee\nrequested and must be accompanied by an affidavit of legal services. Compromise and Account\n1. Jurisdiction over either the defendant or\nthe defendant's insurance carrier must be obtained in any proceeding to\ncompromise a cause of action for personal injury or wrongful death. This\nrequirement is satisfied by either: (a) a\nletter on insurance company letterhead advising of the settlement of a cause of\naction for a specific dollar sum on behalf of their insured\ndefendant; (b) an original signed\nstipulation of settlement or court-certified copy of stipulation placed on the\nrecord; (c) a waiver and consent\nsigned and acknowledged by an insurance company officer who has the authority\nto execute; or\n(d) service of\ncitation on the insurance carrier and the named defendant in the underlying\naction. 2. A copy of the\nattorney's retainer agreement must be filed with the petition regardless\nwhether the parties are competent adults and have consented to the fee\nrequested. 3. A formal judicial\naccount must be filed along with the petition to compromise where either: (a) any party is under a disability\n(\ne.g., infancy, incompetency); (b) there are disputed creditor's\nclaims; (c) there are estate assets\nother than settlement proceeds; or\n(d) the petition seeks to compromise both a\ncause of action for personal injury and for wrongful death. Variance\n\nAny of the rules set forth herein may be varied in the\ndiscretion of the court for good cause shown. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
