The form can also be used in\nnon-IV-D cases. It contains basic case information and space for indicating\nwhich services are requested. The form can be used to request administrative or\nlegal action, including establishment of paternity and/or support obligation, modification, or enforcement. It does not take the place of, and therefore must\nbe accompanied by, the appropriate standard interstate forms (e.g. Uniform\n\nSupport Petition, General Testimony, etc.) and supporting documentation. HEADING/CAPTION (Pages 1 & 3): The\ninitiating jurisdiction determines the heading. Note that the heading appears\non both page 1 of the Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #1 and on page 3, the Acknowledgment page. Identify the petitioner and respondent in\nthe appropriate spaces. Check the appropriate space to identify\nthe type of case: IV-D Non Public Assistance; IV-D Non Public Assistance\n\nMedicaid (indicate whether receiving Full Services or Medical Services Only); IV-D Public Assistance; IV-E Foster Care; or Non IV-D. IV-D means the case is\nbeing worked by the State or local child support enforcement agency (i.e., IV-D\nagency). Public Assistance means the obligee's family receives IV-A cash\npayments [IV-A was formerly called Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AFDC) and is now called Temporary Family Assistance]. A IV-D Non Public\n\nAssistance Medicaid case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid\nbut does not receive Public Assistance (IV-A cash payments). In the space marked \"To:\", list the name\nand address (street, city, State, and zip code) of the central registry, court, or agency where you are sending the CSE Transmittal #1. In IV-D cases, initial\nreferrals must be sent to the responding State's central registry. In non-IV-D\ncases, contact the responding State central registry to determine appropriate\nprocedures. In the appropriate spaces, if applicable\nand if known, enter the Responding jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case\nnumber, and docket number. The responding FIPS code is not essential for an\ninitial IV-D referral since you will be sending the case to the responding\ncentral registry. Under \"docket number\", you may enter the docket number, cause\nnumber, or any other appropriate reference number that the responding State may\nuse to identify the case, if known. In the space marked \"From:\", list a\ncontact person, agency name, address (street, city, State, zip code), phone\nnumber (including extension), fax number, and Internet address. In the appropriate spaces, enter the\n\nInitiating jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case number, and docket\nnumber. Under \"docket number\", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate reference number which the initiating tribunal or\nagency has assigned to the case. In the space marked \"Send Payments To:\"\nenter the address to which payments should be sent, if the address is different\nfrom the agency address provided in the space labelled \"From\". Specify the case\nidentifier if you want the responding jurisdiction to use an identifier other\nthan the initiating IV-D case number when remitting payments. In the appropriate spaces, enter the FIPS\ncode and State where payments should be sent. ____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #1-Initial Request--Page 1\n\nIf funds can be transmitted electronically\nvia Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), enter the bank account number under \"Bank\n\nAccount\" and the bank routing code under \"Routing Code\". Check the appropriate box to indicate\nwhether the initiating jurisdiction uses the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of\n\nSupport Act (URESA) or the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act\n(UIFSA). In the appropriate space, note the State\nwhich you believe has continuing exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ), if known. Under\nUIFSA, a State that issues a child support order maintains CEJ as long as the\nobligor, obligee, or child(ren) reside in that State, or until each party files\nwritten consent allowing another State to assume CEJ. If there are multiple\norders governing the same obligor, obligee, and child(ren), UIFSA contains\nrules for determining which order is controlling. The tribunal that issued the\ncontrolling order has CEJ as long as the conditions for CEJ are met. CEJ means\nthe authority to modify the order. SECTION I (page 1), ACTION: Check the\nappropriate box(es) to indicate which actions are requested. Multiple actions\nmay be requested, as appropriate. In IV-D cases, the responding jurisdiction\nshould provide the full range of appropriate services. for example, even if the\ninitiating IV-D agency only checks box 1 \"Establishment of Paternity\", the\nresponding jurisdiction should establish paternity, establish a support order, and enforce the support order. Check item 1 \"Establishment of Paternity\"\nto request that paternity be established. In a IV-D case, ask another State to\nestablish paternity only if use of long-arm jurisdiction is not appropriate. Be\nsure to attach an \"Affidavit in Support of Establishing Paternity\" for each\nchild whose paternity is at issue. Check item 2 \"Establishment of Order\" to\nrequest that an order be established. Indicate the type of order by checking\nthe appropriate box. Check item 2A \"Child Support\" to request\nthe initial establishment of a new child support order. If the responding State\nuses UIFSA and an order governing the same obligor, obligee, and child(ren)\nalready exists, you should generally only request establishment of a new order\nif: (1) there is more than one existing order, and (2) the obligor, obligee, and child have all moved out of the issuing States. Check item 2B \"Spousal Support\" to request\nestablishment of a spousal support order. Do not check this item in a IV-D\ncase; establishment of spousal support is not a IV-D function. When requesting\nestablishment of spousal support, contact the support enforcement agency for\nthe appropriate procedure. Check item 2C \"Support for a Prior Period\"\nto request establishment of support for prior period. States may establish\nchild support awards covering a prior period, but such awards must be based on\nguidelines and take into consideration either the current earnings and income\nat the time the order is set, or the obligor's earnings and income during the\nprior period. The award of back support is not required under Federal rules but\nmay be appropriate in accordance with State law. Not all States have authority\nto establish support orders for prior periods. Check item 2D \"Medical Coverage\" to\nrequest establishment of an order that provides for the provision of medical\ninsurance or other health care coverage. Medical support must be requested in\nall IV-D Public Assistance cases, all IV-D Non Public Assistance Medicaid\ncases, and in other IV-D Non Public Assistance cases where health coverage is\nsought. ____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #1-Initial Request--Page 2\n\nCheck item 2E \"Other Costs\" to request an\norder for other costs such as: costs of the delivery of the child, other\nmedical costs not covered by insurance, genetic testing, and attorney's fees. Describe the costs in section VII \"Additional Case Information\". Check item 3 \"Enforcement of Responding\n\nTribunal Order\" to request enforcement of an existing order that was issued by\nthe responding tribunal. If multiple orders governing the same\nobligor, obligee, and child(ren) exist, do not ask a responding UIFSA State to\nprospectively enforce (or modify) an order unless that order is the\n\"controlling order\" that has priority under UIFSA. UIFSA contains rules for\ndetermining which order is recognized when multiple orders exist. Under these\nrules: 1. The order issued by a tribunal with\ncontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) has priority. An issuing tribunal\nretains CEJ as long as the issuing State remains the residence of the obligor, obligee, or child, or until all parties file written consent with the tribunal\nallowing another State to assume CEJ. 2. If more than one issuing tribunal would\nhave CEJ, the order issued by the child's current home State has\npriority. 3. If more than one tribunal would have\nCEJ but there is no order in the child's current home State, the most recently\nissued order has priority. 4. If no tribunal would have CEJ, the\nresponding State may issue a new support order and it becomes the CEJ\nState. Check item 4 \"Modification of Responding\n\nTribunal Order\" to request modification (or review and adjustment) of an\nexisting order that was issued by the responding tribunal. Do not request a responding UIFSA State to\nmodify its own order if the obligor, obligee, and child(ren) have all moved out\nof that State, or if the parties have filed written consent with the issuing\ntribunal in that State allowing another State to modify the order. If multiple orders exist, do not ask a\nresponding UIFSA State to modify an order unless that order is the \"controlling\norder\" that has priority under UIFSA. UIFSA contains rules for determining\nwhich order is recognized when multiple orders exist. Generally, you need to attach a completed\n\nGeneral Testimony. Check item 5 \"Change of Payee/Redirection\nof Payment\" to request a change of payee or redirection of payment. Describe\nyour request in Section VII \"Additional Case Information\". \"Change of Payee\" is\nan administrative action used when the person or agency entitled to receive\nfunds has changed. It may occur with a change in Public Assistance or Foster\n\nCare status or a change in custody. \"Redirection of Payment\" is an\nadministrative action used when the custodian has moved. In some States a court\naction may be required if the custodian's move compels transfer of documents or\nfunds to another jurisdiction. Check item 6 \"Registration of Foreign\n\nSupport Order\" to request registration of a support order. Orders from one\n\nState may be registered in another State, under UIFSA, URESA, or the Uniform\n\nEnforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA). Also check item 6A \"For\n____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #1-Initial Request--Page 3\n\nEnforcement Only\", item 6B \"For\n\nModification and Enforcement\" or item 6C \"For Modification\" to indicated\nwhether the registration is for enforcement and/or modification. Check either\nitem 6B or 6C if you are requesting review and adjustment of a foreign order. Check the appropriate box to indicate whether registration is requested by the\nobligor, obligee, or state enforcement agency. To modify another State's order, a\nresponding State must first register the order. To enforce another State's\norder, a responding State may have to register the order; UIFSA allows for\nadministrative enforcement without registration (but requires registration for\nother enforcement actions). When requesting registration, certain\ninformation or documents are required. The requirements for requesting\nregistration depend on whether you are registering the order under UIFSA, URESA\nor UEFJA or other law. To request registration of an order under UIFSA, you\nmust include: o A letter of transmittal to the tribunal\nrequesting registration for enforcement and/or modification. The CSE\nTransmittal #1 serves this function. Check the appropriate boxes in item 6 of\nsection I to indicate the action requested. o Two copies, including one certified copy\nof all orders to be registered, including any modification of an order. o A sworn statement by the party seeking\nregistration or a certified statement by the custodian of records showing the\namount of any arrearage. At State option, page 6a of the General Testimony may\nbe used for this purpose. In section VIII \"Attachments\", check the first box\n(\"Arrears Statement/Payment History\") to indicate that a sworn statement of\narrears is attached. o The name of the obligor and, if known: the obligor's address and Social Security Number; the name and address of the\nobligor's employer and any other source of income of the obligor; and a\ndescription and the location of property of the obligor in the responding State\nnot exempt from execution. Space for most of this information is provided on\nthe CSE Transmittal #1. If you have information about the obligor's other\nsources of income or property, include the information in section VII or an\nattachment. In section VIII, check the box labelled \"Description of\n\nReal/Personal Property\" if a description is attached. o The name and address of the obligee. Space for this information is provided on the CSE Transmittal #1. o If applicable, the agency or person to\nwhom support payments are to be remitted. Space for this information is\nincluded in the heading of the CSE Transmittal #1. In addition, to allow the responding State\nto establish a IV-D case, you will probably need to complete all other\ninformation on the CSE Transmittal #1, particularly information regarding the\nchildren. Furthermore, when requesting registration\nfor modification, you generally need to attach a completed Uniform Support\n\nPetition and General Testimony. ____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #1-Initial Request--Page 4\n\nDo not ask a responding UIFSA State to\nmodify another State's order unless: o (1) the child(ren), obligee, and obligor\ndo not live in the State that issued the order; (2) the party seeking\nmodification does not live in the responding State; and (3) the responding\n\nState has personal jurisdiction over the other party (the party not requesting\nmodification). OR\no The responding State has personal\njurisdiction over the obligor, obligee, or child(ren), and the obligor and\nobligee have filed written consent in the tribunal that issued the order\nproviding that the responding State may modify the support order and assume\ncontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order. If multiple orders governing the same\nobligor, obligee, and child(ren) exist, do not ask a responding UIFSA State to\nprospectively enforce or modify an order unless that order is the \"controlling\norder\" that has priority under UIFSA. UIFSA contains rules for determining\nwhich order is recognized when multiple orders exist. Generally, the CSE Transmittal #1 is used\nto send initial case referrals and the CSE Transmittal #2 is used to\nsend/request additional information or action after the initial referral. However, since the CSE Transmittal #2 does not contain the necessary\ninformation needed to request registration of a foreign order, you may use the\nCSE Transmittal #1 to request registration even in a case that has previously\nbeen referred to the responding jurisdiction. If you are requesting\nregistration in a case that has previously been referred to the responding\njurisdiction, you may send the request directly to the responding entity\nworking the case rather than to the responding central registry. Check item 7 \"Collection of Arrears\" to\nrequest collection of arrears. You should request enforcement of arrears under\nall known orders. Check item 8 \"Income Withholding\" to\nrequest interstate income withholding. If the employer's State uses UIFSA, you\nmay send a withholding order/notice directly to the out-of-State employer. If\nyou prefer, you may still send the CSE Transmittal #1 to send a request for\nwithholding in a IV-D case to the IV-D central registry in a responding State. In fact, in a IV-D case, if the employer's State does not use UIFSA and your\n\nState does not have jurisdiction over the employer under State law, you must\nsend a request, using the CSE Transmittal #1, to the IV-D central registry in\nthe employer's State. Be sure to specify the amount to be withheld. Attach a\ncopy of the support order and, if appropriate, a statement of arrears. Attach\nany other documentation required by the responding State (see the Interstate\n\nRoster and Referral Guide). In some instances, registration of a foreign income\nwithholding order or underlying support order may be necessary. To request\nother enforcement techniques, rather than just income withholding, check item 3\nor item 6, as appropriate. Check item 9 \"Administrative Review for\n\nFederal Tax Offset\" to request an administrative review in the responding State\nif a Federal income tax refund offset has been challenged. Check item 10 \"Other\" if you are\nrequesting a service other than those listed. Describe the service on the blank\nline. SECTION II (page 1), CASE SUMMARY: Provide\ncomplete information for all court/administrative actions regarding support for\ndependents. If there are more than three orders, use additional page(s) or\n\nSection VII. For \"Period of Computation\", enter the month, day, and year\n____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #1-Initial Request--Page 5\nfor both the beginning and ending dates. The information in this section will be used to aid in verifying calculated\narrearages and to assist in determining/verifying which order is controlling\nand which State has continuing exclusive jurisdiction. If you believe a particular order is\ncontrolling under UIFSA, check the box beside \"Presumed Controlling Order\"; otherwise leave the box blank. If there are multiple orders governing the same\nobligor, obligee, and child(ren), UIFSA contains rules for determining which\norder is controlling. The responding tribunal will make the final determination\nregarding which order is controlling. Attach the required number of copies of\nall pertinent orders that relate to support. If you are sending this case to a\n\nState that uses UIFSA, you will generally need to attach two copies, one of\nwhich is certified, of any support order. If you are sending this case to a\n\nState that uses a version of URESA, you will generally need to attach three\ncertified copies of any support order. Note, however, that some responding\n\nStates may be able to take certain administrative enforcement actions (e.g., interstate wage withholding) without having a certified copy of the order, although a regular copy is necessary. SECTION III (page 2), MOTHER INFORMATION: This section provides basic information about the child(ren)'s mother. Check\nthe appropriate box to indicate if the mother is the obligor or obligee. Provide the mother's full name (first, middle, last) as well as aliases or\nmaiden name, and all other information. List additional information (i.e., phone number changes, relatives' phone numbers, multiple employers or assets)\nin section VII. In cases where the mother is the respondent, the information\ncan be used for location purposes if necessary. If the mother's address has\nbeen confirmed or verified, check the \"Address Confirmed\" box and indicate the\ndate the address was confirmed. If the employer/employer's address has been\nconfirmed or verified, check the \"Employer Confirmed\" box and indicate the date\nthe information was confirmed. Verified, current information expedites\nprocessing of any child support case. However, if information cannot be\nverified, provide last known information. SECTION IV (page 2), FATHER INFORMATION: This section provides basic information about the child(ren)'s father. In a\ncase where paternity has not been established, use this section to provide\ninformation about the alleged father. Check the appropriate box to indicate if\nthe father is the obligor or obligee. Provide the father's full name (first, middle, last) as well as aliases, and all other information. List additional\ninformation (i.e., phone number changes, relatives' phone numbers, multiple\nemployers or assets) in section VII. In cases where the father is the\nrespondent, the information can be used for location purposes if necessary. If\nthe father's address has been confirmed or verified, check the \"Address\n\nConfirmed\" box and indicate the date the address was confirmed. If the\nemployer/employer's address has been confirmed or verified, check the \"Employer\n\nConfirmed\" box and indicate the date the information was confirmed. Verified, current information expedites processing of any child support case. However, if\ninformation cannot be verified, provide last known information. SECTION V (page 2), CARETAKER (IF NOT A\nPARENT): Complete this section only if the child(ren)'s caretaker is not the\nchild(ren)'s parent. In the space labelled \"Relationship to Child(ren)\", indicate the relationship of the caretaker to the child(ren). Provide the\ncaretaker's full name (first, middle, last) as well as aliases or maiden name, and all other information. Note: if the caretaker does not have a legal\nobligation to contribute to a child's support, information regarding the\ncaretaker's employment may be privileged. SECTION VI (page 2), DEPENDENT CHILDREN\nINFORMATION: List all children for whom support is owed or being sought. For\neach child, provide full name (first, middle, last) date of birth, sex, Social\n\nSecurity Number, and State of residence for last 6 months. If additional space\nis needed, use section VII. ____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #1-Initial Request--Page 6\nSECTION VII (page 2), ADDITIONAL CASE\nINFORMATION: In this section, provide additional information which may be\nuseful to the responding jurisdiction in working the case, such as pending\naction, amounts reported to credit bureaus, or prior attempts of long-arm\naction. If additional space is needed, attach page(s). If there is an order preventing disclosure\nof a party's or child's address/identifying information, check the box for\n\"Nondisclosure Finding Attached\" and attach a copy of the finding. In\naccordance with the finding, do not provide the address/identifying\ninformation; you may provide a substitute address. A nondisclosure finding\nmeans a finding that the health, safety, or liberty or a party or child would\nbe unreasonably put at risk by disclosure of identifying information (e.g., residential address). UIFSA provides that interstate petitions must include\ncertain identifying information regarding the parties and child(ren) unless a\ntribunal (court or agency) makes a nondisclosure finding by ordering that the\naddress or identifying information not be disclosed. The procedures for\nobtaining a nondisclosure finding vary from State to State. SECTION VIII (page 2), ATTACHMENTS: Check\nthe appropriate box(es) to indicate all documents attached. For attachments\nother than those listed, check \"Other Attachments\" and explain in section\nVII. Attach the required number of copies of\nall pertinent orders that relate to support. If you are sending this case to a\n\nState that uses UIFSA, you will generally need to attach two copies, one of\nwhich is certified, of any support order. If you are sending this case to a\n\nState that uses a version of URESA you will generally need to attach three\ncertified copies of any support order. Note, however, that some responding\n\nStates may be able to take certain administrative enforcement actions (e.g., interstate wage withholding) without having a certified copy of the order, although a regular copy is necessary. At the bottom of page 2, provide a\nspecific worker's name, a direct telephone number (with extension if necessary)\nand fax number to expedite communications between jurisdictions. PAGE 3, ACKNOWLEDGMENT: The responding\njurisdiction completes the Acknowledgments section of page 3 and returns it to\nthe initiating jurisdiction. The initiating jurisdiction should not include\nthis form in the initial referral packet. This form is intended to be generated\nby the responding jurisdiction in response to its receipt of the transmittal\npacket from the initiating State. In addition to acknowledging receipt of the\ncase, the responding jurisdiction may request additional information (a request\nfor state-specific forms which substantially duplicate or duplicate in part the\ncontent or purpose of the standard interstate forms is not allowed) and/or\nreport back to the initiating jurisdiction what action/results have occurred\n(e.g., income withholding begun, arrearage reported to credit bureau, case\nclosed and reason).
