  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 7-1.9 - Water supply\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The water supply serving all plumbing fixtures, including drinking fountains, lavatories and showers, shall, after treatment, meet the provisions required for a public water system as defined in subpart 5-1 of the State Sanitary Code. A temporary residence with an on-site water supply that does not meet the definition of a public water system must comply with the standards established in subpart 5-1 for a non-community water system. (b) Annual start-up. The temporary residence operator must ensure that the following actions have been taken at least 15 days prior to the property's occupancy for which the water supply is utilized each year. The following applies to each on-site potable water system that is not subject to continuous water use, and to each temporary residence potable water supply distribution system which receives water from an off-site public water system and is not subject to continuous water use. (1)\n\nAll water mains shall be disinfected by: (i) completely filling the main to remove all air pockets, flushing the main to remove particulates, and filling the main with potable water. The potable water shall then be chlorinated by feeding liquid hypochlorite at a constant rate such that the water will not have less than a 25 mg/l free chlorine residual throughout the temporary residence water system. After a 24-hour holding period there must be a free chlorine residual of not less than 10 mg/l throughout the temporary residence water system; or\n(ii)\nusing a disinfection method the State Commissioner of Health has determined in writing to be as protective as the disinfection procedure described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nThe water system shall then be flushed and free chlorine residual disinfection concentrations measured at representative points in the distribution system to ensure that no free chlorine is present if a waiver of disinfection has been issued, or that a free chlorine residual of greater than 0.2 mg/l and less than 4.0 mg/l is present in a system with continuous disinfection. (3)\n\nBacteriological samples shall then be collected from each water source at representative points in the distribution system and analyzed at a laboratory certified by New York State Department of Health. (4)\n\nThe facility operator must report sample results, if positive for total coliform or escherichia coli to the permit-issuing official as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours of being notified by the laboratory. Pre-operational water analysis reports must be submitted to the permit-issuing official prior to permit issuance. All other water analysis reports required to be made by this Subpart or requested or ordered by the permit-issuing official shall be submitted to the permit-issuing official within 10 days of the end of each quarter in which samples were collected. (c) Water distribution and treatment. Facilities shall be provided and maintained for the satisfactory treatment and distribution of water. In addition, such facilities shall meet the following requirement: (1)\n\nSubmission of plans; prior approval. A plan for a new or modified water source, or distribution and treatment facilities shall be submitted to the permit-issuing official at least 60 days prior to construction. No construction of new or modified water distribution and/or treatment facilities shall commence until plans and specifications have been submitted to and approved by the permit-issuing official. Construction shall be in accordance with the approved plans. (d) Minimum standards. Potable hot or tempered and cold running water shall be adequate in quantity and quality and shall be readily available to occupants of the temporary residence. Only potable water shall be easily accessible. Any non-potable water supply shall be conspicuously labeled as a non-potable supply. An adequate supply shall mean a minimum of 50 gallons per person per day or more dependant upon amenities provided at the facility, unless otherwise justified in writing by a professional engineer or registered architect licensed to practice in New York State and deemed acceptable by the permit-issuing official. (e) Connections prohibited. There shall be no physical connection between the potable water supply and any non-potable water supply. Any fixture, installation or equipment, which is subject to back-siphonage, shall be adequately installed and maintained to protect against contamination of the water system. (f) A minimum pressure of 20 pounds per square inch, at peak demand, shall be maintained in all parts of the water distribution system. (g) A common drinking utensil shall not be provided for individual consumption of potable water. (h) Interruptions, changes in sources or treatments. Any incident or condition, which affects the quantity or quality of the on-site potable water supply, shall be reported to the permit-issuing official within 24 hours of occurrence. There shall be no changes made to the source or method of treatment of a potable water supply, either temporary or permanent, without first receiving approval from the permit-issuing official. An adequate supply of potable water must be provided and maintained during all times of operation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
