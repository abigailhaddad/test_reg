  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 219.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This department is concerned with those instances in which advertisements have tended to mislead and deceive the public. It is the purpose of the rules and guidelines set forth in this Part to assure truthful and adequate disclosure of all material and relevant information in the advertising of life insurance policies and annuity contracts through various advertising media in order to provide the public with the necessary information upon which to base a decision regarding the purchase of life insurance and annuities. The rules and guidelines will also serve to prevent unfair competition among insurers. (b) It should be noted that the lack of a specific prohibition in this Part does not necessarily imply acceptance of a practice; rather, the principles underlying the rules should be applied to all situations so as to carry out the stated and implied purpose of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n219.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
