(c) Application approval. (1)\n\nApproval of an application for State\nassistance to undertake an investigation project does not bind the department\nto approve State assistance to undertake a remediation project nor to provide\nany assurance of approval or availability of funds for remediation. (2)\n\nIf the field work for a project for which\n\nState assistance is provided is not initiated within 12 months of the\ndepartment's approval of its application, or such other time period as the\ndepartment may approve, the municipality will be notified in writing of its\nfailure to implement the project, the project will be removed from the approved\nlist, and the department will reallocate monies allocated to the removed\nproject for other complete applications.
