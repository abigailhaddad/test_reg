Part 3)\n\nThe following methods and procedures will provide steam of\nculinary quality for use in the processing of milk, milk products and\nwhey. SOURCE OF BOILER FEED WATER\nPotable water or water supplies acceptable to the regulatory\nagency shall be used. FEED WATER TREATMENT\nFeed waters may be treated, if necessary, for proper boiler\ncare and operation. Boiler feed water treatment and control shall be under the\nsupervision of trained personnel or a firm specializing in industrial water\nconditioning. Such personnel shall be informed that the steam is to be used for\nculinary purposes. Pretreatment of feed waters for boilers or steam generating\nsystems to reduce water hardness, before entering the boiler or steam generator\nby ion exchange or other acceptable procedures, is preferable to addition of\nconditioning compounds to boiler waters. Only compounds complying with\n\nSection\n173.310\nof Title 21 of the Code of Federal\n\nRegulations may be used to prevent corrosion and scale in\nboilers or to facilitate sludge removal. Greater amounts shall not be used of the boiler water treatment\ncompounds than the minimum necessary for controlling boiler scale or other\nboiler water treatment purposes. No greater amount of steam shall be used for\nthe treatment and/or pasteurization of milk, milk products and whey than\nnecessary. It should be noted that tannin, which is also frequently added\nto boiler water to facilitate sludge removal during boiler blow-down has been\nreported to give rise to odor problems, and should be used with caution. Boiler compounds containing cyclohexylamine, morpholine, octadecylamine, diethylaminoethanol, trisodium nitrilotriacetate, and hydrazine\nshall not be permitted for use in steam in contact with milk, milk products and\nwhey. BOILER OPERATION\nA supply of clean, dry saturated steam is necessary for proper\nequipment operation; boilers and steam generation equipment shall be operated\nin such a manner as to prevent foaming, priming, carryover and excessive\nentrainment of boiler water into the steam. Carryover of boiler water additives\ncan result in the production of off-flavors. Manufacturers' instructions\nregarding recommended water level and blow-down should be consulted and\nrigorously followed. The blow-down of the boiler should be carefully watched, so that an over-concentration of the boiler water solids and foaming is\navoided. It is recommended that periodic analyses be made of condensate\nsamples. Such samples should be taken from the line between the final steam\nseparating equipment and the point of the introduction of steam into the\nproduct. PIPING ASSEMBLIES\nSuggested piping assemblies for steam infusion or injection are\nshown on Figure 5. Other assemblies which will assure a clean dry saturated steam\nare acceptable.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
