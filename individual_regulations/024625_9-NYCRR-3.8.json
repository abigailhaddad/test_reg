Tit. 9 § 3.8 - Executive order no. 8: creating women's division in the executive chamber\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn recognition of the rightful claim of the women of this\n\nState for equal opportunity and status in every phase of life, I am today\ntransforming and expanding the Women's Unit, by recreating it as the Women's\n\nDivision in the Executive Chamber, a division with coordinating functions for\nall women's interests in the State. The Women's Division, as the only women's\nagency in New York State government, shall continue to be a full-time staff\nunit of the Executive Chamber whose function shall be the development of\neffective and responsive programs and projects on State, local and Federal\nlevels in the public and private sectors, promoting equal opportunity and\nstatus for women. Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the\n\nConstitution and laws of the State of New York, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of\nthe State of New York, do hereby establish by executive order the Women's\n\nDivision in the Executive Chamber, which will continue the functions of the\n\nWomen's Unit in the Office of the Secretary to the Governor and supersede that\nunit as a separate division within the Executive Chamber. I hereby appoint Mary\n\nBurke Nicholas as Director of the Women's Division, to report directly to\nme. I. Powers and Duties of the\n\nWomen's Division. The Women's Division shall: -- act as a center of communication about legislation\naffecting the interests of women; -- maintain and develop a roster of women qualified to\nserve in State government as an aid to the Governor and others in making\nappointments; -- establish a liaison and work with all other government\nagencies involved in the implementation of laws, ordinances and regulations and\nwith the development of programs which affect the status of women; -- act as a liaison between women's organizations in the\n\nState and State government; -- develop, design and recommend to me new programs and\nprojects which will improve the status of women and the quality of State\nservices to women; -- assist in insuring that the hiring, training and\npromotion of women in State government goes forward, and that new and\ninnovative efforts are made to increase the number of women in decisionmaking\nposts, as is outlined in Part II of the Order. II. Equal Employment Opportunity for Women in\n\nState Government. It shall be the duty of the new Women's Division to ensure\nfulfillment of the State's policy of encouraging employment opportunities for\nwomen at all levels of State government and to make State government fully\nreflective of the needs, interests and talents of all of our population. The following steps and procedures, as set forth in\n\nExecutive Order No. 11, promulgated on September 24, 1974, and continued by my\n\nExecutive Order No. 1, promulgated January 1, 1975, shall continue to be\nfollowed by each State department and agency to promote the active recruitment, training and advancement of women. A. Agency and Department Actions. Each State agency or department, under the guidance of the\n\nWomen's Division, and with the cooperation and technical assistance of the\n\nState Department of Civil Service, shall: develop and implement a recruitment and informational\ncampaign directed at encouraging women to enter State service. Each agency and\ndepartment shall review its current recruitment procedures to insure that these\nprocedures do not discourage such entry, especially at middle and top\nmanagement levels; insure that women are fairly represented in all training\nprograms, whether technical, professional or administrative; assess the eligibility for advancement of current employees\nto assure the objective consideration of women for promotional opportunities\nand training opportunities. Each agency and department shall review the\nemployment records of employees excluded in the past from movement into\nadministrative and management positions to determine if a lack of opportunity\nto participate in training programs has contributed to their non-advancement, and shall to the maximum extent feasible provide for new training opportunities\nin such cases; remove barriers to the entry of women into State government\nand to their promotion in State service by reviewing and analyzing the\nrelevance of current job qualification requirements and removing any\nrequirements that are not specifically related to the job to be performed and\nthat serve only to limit full and flexible job opportunity; designate personnel responsible for the development and\neffectiveness of programs aimed at achieving equitable representation of women\nat all levels within that agency or department. B. Reports to the Governor\n\nThe head of every State agency shall report to the Governor\non or before May 1st, and biannually thereafter, on the specific efforts such\nagency has undertaken to achieve an equitable representation of women at all\njob levels within that agency. The agency heads shall supply to the Governor\nany information which the Governor or the Director of the Women's Division\nrequests to demonstrate implementation of the steps and procedures outlined in\n\nPart II of this Order. The Director of the Women's Division shall assist the\n\nGovernor in evaluating department and agency compliance and shall make\nrecommendations to the Governor as to how such compliance may be\nimproved.
