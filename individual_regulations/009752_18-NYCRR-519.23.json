  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 519.23 - Decision without hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Either party may request that an appeal\nfrom a department determination be decided without a hearing. Such request will\nbe granted when it is determined that no unresolved material issue of fact is\ninvolved in the case and that the only questions presented are questions of the\ndepartment's application of the law or its regulations, whether the department\nfailed to perform a duty required by law or whether the department's\ndetermination was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion as to the\nsanction imposed. A request for a decision without a hearing must be\naccompanied by sufficient information to permit a determination of whether any\nunresolved material issue of fact exists, and should contain a full and clear\nstatement of the issue and the party's position on the issue. (b) Upon receipt of a request for a decision\nwithout a hearing which presents, on its face, no factual dispute, a copy of\nthe request and any supporting documents will be sent to the party who did not\ninitiate the request. Within 30 working days of its receipt of the request and\ndocuments, the party who did not initiate the request must forward to the\nhearing officer, and the requesting party, its response containing sufficient\ninformation to ensure resolution of the dispute. (c) The hearing officer will make any further\ninquiries of the appellant, the appellant's representative and the department\nwhich are necessary to resolve the issues involved. (d) If at any point after a request for a\ndecision without a hearing is received, it appears that there is a material and\nunresolved issue of fact relating to the issue or issues upon which the hearing\nhas been requested, the hearing officer must inform the parties that a hearing\nin accordance with the provisions of this Part appears to be necessary to\nresolve the dispute, and the appellant will then have the option of proceeding\nwith such hearing or withdrawing the request for review.
