Except as provided in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, the mirror shall provide a field of view with\nan included horizontal angle measured from the projected eye point of at least\n20 degrees, and sufficient vertical angle to provide a view of a level road\nservice extending to the horizon beginning at a point not greater than 200 feet\nto the rear of the vehicle when the vehicle is occupied by the driver and four\npassengers or the designed occupant weight of 150 pounds. The line of sight may\nbe partially obscured by seated occupants or by head restraints. (2)\n\nMounting. The passenger car mirror\nmounting shall provide a stable support for the mirror, and shall provide for\nmirror adjustment by tilting in both horizontal and vertical directions. If the\nmirror is in the head impact area, the mounting shall deflect, collapse, or\nbreak away without leaving sharp edges when the mirror is subjected to a force\nof 90 pounds in a forward or sideward direction in any plane 45 degrees above\nor below the horizontal. (b) Outside rear-view mirror--driver's side. (1)\n\nField of view. Each passenger car shall\nhave an outside mirror of unit magnification. The mirror shall provide the\ndriver a view of a level road surface extending to the horizon from a line, perpendicular to a longitudinal plane tangent to the driver's side of the\nvehicle at the widest point, extending eight feet out from the tangent plane 35\nfeet behind the driver's eyes, with the seat in the rearmost position. The line\nof sight may be partially obscured by rear body or fender contours. (2)\n\nMounting. The mirror mounting shall\nprovide a stable support for the mirror, and neither the mirror nor the\nmounting shall protrude farther than the widest part of the vehicle body except\nto the extent necessary to produce a field of view meeting or exceeding the\nrequirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision. The mirror shall not be\nobscured by the unwiped portion of the windshield, and shall be adjustable by\ntilting in both horizontal and vertical directions from the driver's seated\nposition. The mirror and mounting shall be free of sharp points or edges that\ncould contribute to pedestrian injury. (c) Outside rear-view mirror passenger's\nside. Each passenger car whose inside rear-view mirror does not meet the field\nof view requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall have an outside\nrear-view mirror of unit magnification installed on the passenger's side. The\nmirror mounting shall provide a stable support and be free of sharp points or\nedges that could contribute to pedestrian injury. The mirror need not be\nadjustable from the driver's seat but shall be capable of adjustment by tilting\nin both horizontal and vertical directions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
