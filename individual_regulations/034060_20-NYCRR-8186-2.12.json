  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-2.12 - Rescission and reestablishment of final equalization rates or ratios\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A final\nequalization rate or ratio may be rescinded by ORPTS in accordance with the\nprovisions of this section. Grounds for rescission shall be: (1)\na failure to comply with the applicable\nlaw, statutory or regulatory, in the establishment of the final rate or\nratio; (2)\na change in the reported\ntotal assessed value, or total initial assessed value, of taxable real property\ncaused by a corrected assessor's report or a court ordered reduction in one or\nmore assessments; or\n(3)\na\nsignificant error made in the computation of the final rate or ratio. A\nsignificant error is an error the correction of which results in a percent\ndifference between the final rate or ratio and the recalculated final rate or\nratio equal to or greater than two percent. Significant errors include, but are\nnot limited to, mistakes in transcription from an original record, transposition of numbers and mathematical errors. Significant errors do not\ninclude matters requiring the exercise of judgment or discretion. (b) ORPTS or any municipal\nofficial authorized to file a complaint on a tentative equalization rate or\nratio pursuant to section\n8186-15.2\nof this Part may request the rescission of a final equalization rate or ratio. Any such request by a municipal official must be made in writing to ORPTS. The\nmunicipal official filing the request shall receive notice of the\ndetermination. (c) In addition to\nthe reasons set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, if ORPTS believes\nthat a final equalization rate or ratio would be manifestly unjust because its\nuse would result in an inequitable apportionment of taxes or the assessment or\nreal property at an inappropriate level, ORPTS may, upon notice to the clerk of\nthe assessing unit, rescind the final equalization rate or ratio. (d) In rescinding final rates and ratios, ORPTS will comply with the provisions of Subpart 8186-15 of this Part so far as\npracticable. (e) No final\nequalization rate or ratio shall be rescinded and a new equalization rate or\nratio established where either: (1)\nrecomputation of a new rate or ratio results in a percentage change of less\nthan two percent; or\n(2)\nthe final\nequalization rate has been used to apportion any levy of taxes or to determine\nclass tax shares.
