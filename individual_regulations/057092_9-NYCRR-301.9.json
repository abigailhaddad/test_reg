Tit. 9 § 301.9 - Scheduling, cancellation, consistency with application\n\nState Regulations\n\nFacility managers shall be responsible for the scheduling\nof use of State facilities. Planned events must be conducted within approved\nparameters, including but not limited to described use, time frames, physical\nareas and any conditions imposed by the commissioner.

The State\nshall not be responsible for any loss or damage to personal property or for\npersonal injury that occurs on State property; provided, however, that this\nsubdivision shall not preclude the commissioner from consideration of a claim\nfor property damage or personal injury pursuant to section\n8\n(12-a)\nof the State Finance\n\nLaw.
