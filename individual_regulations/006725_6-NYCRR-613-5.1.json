  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 613-5.1 - Tank systems: design, construction, and equipment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The\nprovisions of this Subpart apply to hydrant systems. (b) Design and equipment requirements\nfor hydrant systems. Hydrant systems must meet the following\nrequirements: (1)\n\nTank\nrequirements. (i) UST\nsystems. Tanks that are part of UST systems must meet the requirements\nof paragraph 2.1(b)(1) of this Part, with the exception of the following: (a) field-constructed tanks with a design\ncapacity greater than 50,000 gallons, which may instead meet the alternative\nrequirements of paragraph 2.1(c)(1) of this Part; and\n(b) ASTs, which must instead meet the\nrequirements of paragraph 4.1(b)(1) of this Part. (ii)\nAST systems. Tanks that\nare part of AST systems must meet the requirements of paragraph 4.1(b)(1) of\nthis Part, with the exception of USTs, which must instead meet the requirements\nof paragraph 3.1(b)(1) of this Part. (2)\n\nPiping and ancillary equipment\nrequirements. The requirements of this paragraph apply to all piping\nand ancillary equipment that are in contact with the ground and routinely\ncontains petroleum. (i) UST systems. Piping and ancillary equipment that are part of\nUST systems must meet the requirements of paragraph 2.1(b)(2) of this Part, with the exception of piping associated with field-constructed tanks with a\ndesign capacity greater than 50,000 gallons, which may instead meet the\nalternative requirements of paragraph 2.1(c)(2) of this Part. (ii)\nAST systems. Piping and\nancillary equipment that are part of AST systems must meet the requirements of\nparagraph 4.1(b)(2) of this Part, with the exception of piping associated with\nfield-constructed tanks with a design capacity greater than 50,000 gallons, which may instead meet the alternative requirements of paragraph 4.1(c)(2) of\nthis Part. (3)\n\nOverfill prevention. (i) UST systems. Tanks that are part of UST systems must meet the\nrequirements of paragraph 2.1(b)(3) of this Part, with the exception of ASTs, which must meet the requirements of paragraph 4.1(b)(3) of this Part. (ii)\nAST systems. Tanks that\nare part of AST systems must meet the requirements of paragraph 4.1(b)(3) of\nthis Part, with the exception of USTs, which must meet the requirements of\nparagraph 3.1(b)(3) of this Part. (4)\n\nFill port catch basins. Except for UST systems filled by transfers of no more than 25 gallons at one\ntime, UST systems must be equipped with a fill port catch basin at every fill\nport, that will prevent the release of petroleum when the transfer hose is\ndetached from the fill pipe. (5)\n\nDispenser systems. UST systems must be equipped with\nunder-dispenser containment for any new dispenser system that is installed. (i) A dispenser system is considered new when\nboth the dispenser and the equipment needed to connect the dispenser to the UST\nsystem are installed at a facility. The equipment necessary to connect the\ndispenser to the UST system includes check valves, shear valves, unburied\nrisers or flexible connectors, or other transitional components that are\nbeneath the dispenser and connect the dispenser to the piping. (ii)\n\nUnder-dispenser containment must be\nliquid-tight on its sides, on the bottom, and at any penetrations. Under-dispenser containment must allow for visual inspection and access to the\ncomponents within it or be continuously electronically monitored for leaks from\nthe dispenser system. (6)\n\nValves. Hydrant systems\nmust be equipped with valves described in this paragraph as applicable. (i) Shear valves. Dispensers\nof motor fuel under pressure from a remote pumping system must be equipped with\na shear valve (\ni.e., impact valve). Category 1 and 2 valves\nmust meet the standards set forth in NFPA 30A (1984 edition), section 4-3.6. Category 3 valves must meet the standards set forth in NFPA 30A (2012 edition), section\n6.3.9. (ii)\n\nSolenoid or anti-siphon\nvalves. Piping and dispensers that are part of hydrant systems storing\nmotor fuel and are at an elevation below the top of the tank, must be equipped\nwith a device such as a solenoid valve that is positioned adjacent to and\ndownstream from the operating valve. Category 1 and 2 valves must meet the\nstandards set forth in NFPA 30A (1984 edition), section 2-1.7. Category 3\nvalves must meet the standards set forth in NFPA 30A (2012 edition), section\n4.2.4. (iii)\n\nBackflow check valves. Delivery piping associated with a pump-filled tank must be equipped with a\nproperly functioning check valve or equivalent device that provides automatic\nprotection against backflow. Check valves are required only when the\narrangement of the delivery piping is such that backflow from the receiving\ntank is possible. For ASTs where loading and unloading is done through a common\npipe system, an operating valve accessible to the person responsible for\ntransfer activities, may be used in place of a check valve. (iv)\n\nOperating valves. Connections on a tank through which petroleum can normally flow and that have\nthe potential to drain the tank via gravity, must be equipped with an operating\nvalve to control the flow. Operating valves must be installed as close as\npracticable to the tank connection. (7)\n\nCompatibility. Tank\nsystem equipment must be either made of or lined with materials that are\ncompatible with the petroleum stored in the hydrant system. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
