  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7.27 - Executive order no. 27: authorizing new york city off-track betting corporation to file petition under provisions of the laws of the united states for composition or adjustment of municipal indebtedness\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, Article I, Section 9 of the New York State\n\nConstitution recognizes, as a permissible exception to an otherwise general\nprohibition against the authorization or allowance of gambling in this State, \"pari-mutuel betting on horse races as may be prescribed by the legislature and\nfrom which the state shall derive a reasonable revenue for the support of\ngovernment;\" and\nWHEREAS, pursuant to a series of Chapters of the Laws of\n\nNew York, commencing with Chapter 143 of the Laws of 1970, the Legislature has\nauthorized establishment, conduct and operation of off-track pari-mutuel\nbetting systems on horse racing by designated public benefit corporations in\nparticipating municipalities within this State; and\nWHEREAS, pursuant to such legislation, including among\nother Chapter Laws, Chapter 865 of the Laws of 1982, the operation of an\noff-track pari-mutuel betting system by a public benefit corporation known as\nthe New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation (\"NYCOTB\") in New York City, is\ndeemed to be a matter of State concern and a public purpose that cannot be\nadequately attained except by the powers of government, and that such public\nbenefit corporation, as a body politic and corporate exercising the powers\nconferred upon it by the Legislature, performs a governmental function; and\nWHEREAS, since inception nearly forty years ago, NYCOTB\ncumulatively has generated more than $4.515 billion for the support of the\n\nState, local governmental units within New York State and the horse racing\nindustry; and\nWHEREAS, in the Report of the independent certified public\naccountants to NYCOTB for each fiscal year since Fiscal Year 2005, NYCOTB's\noutside auditing firm has noted that NYCOTB has been required to make\ndistributions in excess of its operating income before statutory distributions, thereby prompting the outside auditor to highlight the existence of uncertainty\nas to the ability of NYCOTB to continue to maintain operations as a \"going\nconcern\"; and\nWHEREAS, in consequence of the recurring circumstance of\nNYCOTB being required to make distributions that have exceeded revenue\navailable for distribution after satisfaction of expenses of operation, the\n\nMayor of the City of New York and the Board of Directors of NYCOTB, all of whom\nwere appointees of the Mayor, directed NYCOTB management to prepare a plan for\na full shut down of NYCOTB operations as of June 15, 2008; and\nWHEREAS, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 115 of the\n\nLaws of 2008, effective as of June 17, 2008, control of NYCOTB was transferred\nfrom the City of New York to the State, and the responsibility and power to\nappoint the members of the NYCOTB Board of Directors shifted to the Governor\nfrom the Mayor of New York City; and\nWHEREAS, in the ensuing fourteen months following the\neffective date of Chapter 115, the financial circumstances of NYCOTB have\ncontinued to deteriorate, leading to the further depletion of cash available\nfor operations and to the realistic prospect that NYCOTB may completely exhaust\ncash available to fund continued operations beyond the close of its current\n2010 fiscal year on March 31, 2010; and\nWHEREAS, as recently as August 14, 2009 the Office of the\n\nState Comptroller publically reported that: \"The New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation (NYC OTB), is facing financial insolvency if current financial trends continue.... The\nNYC OTB's operating expenses and accumulated losses have increased steadily in\nthe last four years, resulting in an operating deficit of approximately $38\nmillion. In total, the organization has an outstanding deficit of more than\n$228 million.... NYC OTB provides millions of dollars in revenues to the\nhorse racing industry, which in turn provides employment for thousands of New\n\nYorkers. The industry is too important to fail. Something has to be done. Inaction will mean insolvency\"; and\nWHEREAS, the conclusions announced by the Comptroller\nvalidate and reinforce the public policy expressed by the Legislature when it\ntransferred NYCOTB to the control of the State and adopted Chapter 115 of the\n\nLaws of 2008, which provides: \"The legislature hereby finds that the New York City\noff-track betting corporation (NYC OTB) is insolvent and facing closure. The\nlegislature further finds that nearly 1.1 billion dollars, almost half of all\nmoney wagered on horse racing in New York state, is wagered through NYC OTB. The revenue distributed to the racing industry, which is derived from wagering\nthrough NYC OTB, plays an integral role in sustaining the viability of the\nentire horse racing industry, and NYCOTB employs almost 1,500 people in New\n\nYork. The legislature therefore determines that the continued operation of NYC\nOTB Corporation is of paramount importance to the public interest\"; and\nWHEREAS, the Board of Directors of NYCOTB is considering\nactions to restore fiscal equilibrium to NYCOTB and enable it to continue to\nfulfill its tri-partite statutory mission of: (i) generating reasonable revenue for the\nsupport of government, (ii)\npreventing and curbing unlawful bookmaking and illegal wagering on horse races, and\n(iii)\nensuring that off-track\nbetting is conducted in a manner compatible with the well being of the horse\nracing and breeding industries in this State; and\nWHEREAS, it is in the public interest to afford maximum\nflexibility to the NYCOTB Board of Directors as it charts a course to return\nNYCOTB to fiscal solvency and enable fulfillment and attainment of the mission\nassigned to it by the Legislature. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DAVID A. PATERSON, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York do hereby order as follows: The New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation, as\nreconstituted and continued in existence pursuant to Section 27 of Chapter 115\nof the Laws of 2008, is hereby authorized to and may file any petition with any\n\nUnited States district court or court of bankruptcy under any provision of the\nlaws of the United States, now or hereafter in effect, for the composition or\nadjustment of municipal indebtedness.
