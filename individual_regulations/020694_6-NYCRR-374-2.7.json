  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 374-2.7 - Standards for used oil burners who burn off-specification used oil for energy recovery\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nGeneral. The\nrequirements of this section apply to used oil burners except as specified in\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. A\nused oil\nburner\nis a facility where used oil not meeting the specification\nrequirements in section\n374-2.2\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart is burned for energy recovery in devices identified in paragraph\n(b)(1) of this section. Facilities burning used oil for energy recovery under\nthe following conditions are not subject to this section: (i) the used oil is burned by the generator\nin an on-site space heater under the provisions of section\n374-2.3\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart; or\n(ii)\nthe used oil is\nburned by a processor/re-refiner for purposes of processing used oil, which is\nconsidered burning incidentally to used oil processing. (2)\n\nOther applicable provisions. Used oil\nburners must comply with the applicable requirements of Parts 201 and 225 of\nthis Title. In addition, used oil burners who conduct the following activities\nare also subject to the requirements of other applicable provisions of this\n\nSubpart as indicated below: (i) burners who\ngenerate used oil must also comply with section\n374-2.3\nof this Subpart; (ii)\nburners who transport used oil must also\ncomply with section\n374-2.5\nof this Subpart and Part\n364 of this Title, if applicable; (iii)\nexcept as provided in paragraph (b)(2)\nof this section, burners who process or re-refine used oil must also comply\nwith section\n374-2.6\nof this Subpart; (iv)\nburners who direct shipments of\noff-specification used oil from their facility to a used oil burner, or first\nclaim that used oil that is to be burned for energy recovery meets the used oil\nfuel specifications set forth in section\n374-2.2\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart, must also comply with section\n374-2.8\nof this Subpart; and\n(v) burners who dispose of used\noil must comply with section\n374-2.9\nof this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nSpecification fuel. This section does not apply to persons burning used oil\nthat meets the used oil fuel specification of section\n374-2.2\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart, provided that the burner complies with the requirements of\nsection\n374-2.8\nof this\n\nSubpart. (b) Restrictions on burning. (1)\n\nOff-specification used oil fuel may be burned for energy recovery in only the\nfollowing devices: (i) industrial furnaces\nidentified in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle; (ii)\nboilers, as defined in\nsection\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, that are identified as follows: (a) industrial boilers located on the site of a facility engaged in a manufacturing\nprocess where substances are transformed into new products, including the\ncomponent parts of products, by mechanical or chemical processes; (b) utility boilers used to produce electric\npower, steam, heated or cooled air, or other gases or fluids for sale; or\n(c) on-site burning in space\nheaters. Generators may burn used oil in used oil-fired space heaters provided\nthat: (1)\nthe heater burns only used oil that\nthe owner or operator generates or used oil received from household\ndo-it-yourselfer used oil generators; (2)\nthe heater is designed to have a maximum\ncapacity of no more than 0.5 million Btu per hour; and\n(3)\nthe combustion gases from the heater are\nvented to the outside ambient air; (iii)\nhazardous waste incinerators subject to\nregulation under section\n373-2.15\nor\n373-3.15\nof this Title. (2)\n\nOther used oil\nactivities. (i) Except as provided in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, used oil burners may not process used oil\nunless they also comply with the requirements of section\n374-2.6\nof this Subpart. (ii)\n\nUsed oil burners may aggregate\noff-specification used oil with virgin oil or on-specification used oil for\npurposes of burning, but may not aggregate for purposes of producing\non-specification used oil. (c) Notification. (1)\n\nIdentification numbers. Used oil burners\nwhich have not previously complied with the notification requirements of RCRA\nsection 3010 must comply with these requirements and obtain an EPA\nidentification number. (2)\n\nMechanics of notification. Used oil burners who have not received an EPA\nidentification number may obtain one by notifying the EPA regional\nadministrator of their used oil activity by submitting either: (i) a completed EPA Form 8700-12 (EPA Form\n8700-12 is available at the EPA website, http://www.epa.gov); or\n(ii)\na letter requesting an EPA\nidentification number. Call the RCRA/Superfund Hotline to determine where to\nsend a letter requesting an EPA identification number. The letter must include\nthe following information: (a) burner company\nname; (b) owner of the burner\ncompany; (c) mailing address for\nthe burner; (d) name and telephone\nnumber for the burner point of contact; (e) type of used oil activity; and\n(f) location of the burner\nfacility. (3)\n\nDepartment notification. A used oil burner must notify the department in\nwriting of its operation. Such notification must be sent to the department\noffice of the region in which the facility is located. (d) Quality control and rebuttable\npresumption for used oil. (1)\n\nTo\nensure that used oil managed at a used oil burner facility is not hazardous\nwaste under the rebuttable presumption of section\n374-2.2\n(a)(2)(i)\n(\nb\n) of this Subpart, a used oil burner must determine whether\nthe total halogen content of used oil managed at the facility is greater than\nor equal to 1,000 ppm. (2)\n\nThe used\noil burner must determine if the used oil contains greater than or equal to\n1,000 ppm total halogens by: (i) testing the\nused oil; (ii)\napplying knowledge\nof the halogen content of the used oil in light of the materials or processes\nused; or\n(iii)\nif the used oil has\nbeen received from a processor/re-refiner subject to regulation under section\n374-2.6\nof this Subpart, using\ninformation provided by the processor/re-refiner. (3)\n\nIf the used oil contains greater than or\nequal to 1,000 ppm total halogens, it is presumed to be a hazardous waste\nbecause it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title. The owner or\noperator may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not\ncontain hazardous waste (for example, by demonstrating that the used oil does\nnot contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents\nlisted in Appendix 23 of this Title). (i) Laboratory analyses completed for purposes of rebuttable presumption must be\nperformed by a laboratory currently certified under the appropriate approval\ncategories by the New York State Department of Health's Environmental\n\nLaboratory Approval Program (ELAP). (ii)\n\nThe rebuttable presumption does not\napply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are\nprocessed, through a tolling arrangement, as described in section\n374-2.3\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart, to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply\nto metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other\nmanner, or disposed. (iii)\n\nThe\nrebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are\ndestined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils\ncontaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other\nthan refrigeration units. (4)\n\nUsed oil containing 50 ppm by weight, or\ngreater, of PCBs is a hazardous waste, excluding oil derived from small\ncapacitors, as defined in section\n371.4\n(e)(3)(ii)\nof\nthis Title, as the sole PCB contamination source. Applicable standards are\ncontained in Part 370 through Subpart 374-1 and Part 376 of this\n\nTitle. (5)\n\nRecord retention. Records of analyses conducted or information used to comply with paragraphs\n(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this subdivision must be maintained by the burner for\nat least three years. (e) Used oil storage. Used oil burners are also subject to all applicable Spill\n\nPrevention, Control and Countermeasures ( 40 CFR part\n112, as incorporated by\nreference in section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) in addition to the requirements of this section. Used oil burners are\nalso subject to the Underground Storage Tank ( 40 CFR part\n280, as incorporated\nby reference in section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) standards for used oil stored in underground tanks whether or not the\nused oil exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste, in addition to the\nrequirements of this section. (1)\n\nStorage units. Used oil burners may not store used oil in units other than\ntanks, containers, or units subject to regulation under Subparts 373-2 and\n373-3 of this Title. (2)\n\nUsed oil\ntanks. Compliance with petroleum bulk storage regulations. (i) All aboveground or underground used oil\ntank systems, regardless of tank size, must be in compliance with Part 613 of\nthis Title. In addition, used oil burners must comply with the following\nrequirements: (a) aboveground used oil tanks\nmust be equipped with secondary containment: (1)\nthe secondary containment system must\nconsist of, at a minimum: (i) dikes, berms or\nretaining walls; and\n(ii)\na floor. The floor must cover the entire area within the dikes, berms, or retaining\nwalls, except, for tanks existing as of January 14, 1995, where existing\nportions of the tank meet the ground; or\n(iii)\nan equivalent secondary containment\nsystem; (2)\nthe entire\ncontainment system, including walls and floors, must be sufficiently impervious\nto used oil to prevent any used oil released into the containment system from\nmigrating out of the system to the soil, groundwater, or surface\nwater; (b) used oil tanks\nat a facility licensed under Part 610 of this Title do not require registration\nunder Part 613 of this Title. (ii)\n\nNew aboveground and new underground used\noil tank systems, regardless of tank size, must be installed in accordance with\n\nPart 613 of this Title. (3)\n\nCondition of units. Containers and\naboveground used oil tanks used to store used oil at burner facilities must be: (i) in good condition (no severe rusting, apparent structural defects or deterioration); and\n(ii)\nnot leaking (no visible\nleaks). (4)\n\nSecondary\ncontainment for containers. Containers used to store used oil at burner\nfacilities must be equipped with a secondary containment system. (i) The secondary containment system must\nconsist of, at a minimum: (a) dikes, berms or\nretaining walls; and\n(b) a floor. The floor must cover the entire area within the dike, berm, or retaining\nwall. (ii)\n\nThe entire\ncontainment system, including walls and floor, must be sufficiently impervious\nto used oil to prevent any used oil released into the containment system from\nmigrating out of the system to the soil, groundwater, or surface\nwater. (5)\n\nLabels. (i) Every container and aboveground used oil\ntank used to store used oil at a burner facility must be clearly labeled or\nmarked with the words \"Used Oil\". In addition, every aboveground tank used to\nstore oil at a burner facility must be labeled with the design capacity and\nworking capacity of the tank. (ii)\n\nFill pipes used to transfer used oil into underground used oil tanks at burner\nfacilities must be clearly labeled or marked with the capacity of the tank and\nwith the words \"Used Oil\". (6)\n\nResponse to releases. (i) Any spill, discharge, or release of used\noil shall be subject to all applicable provisions of article 12 of the\n\nNavigation Law (NL sections 170 through 197) and its implementing rules and\nregulations, 17 NYCRR Parts\n32\n-\n33\nand Part 611 of this Title, regarding, but\nnot limited to, notification, clean-up, and liability, and are also subject to\napplicable provisions of article 17, titles 10 and 17, of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law, and Subpart 613-6 of this Title. (ii)\n\nUpon detection of a release of used oil\nto the environment that is not subject to the requirements of subpart F of 40\nCFR part\n280, and Subpart 613-6 of this Title, as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, a burner must perform the following cleanup steps: (a) stop the release; (b) contain the released used oil; (c) clean up and manage properly the released\nused oil and other materials; (d) if necessary, repair or replace any leaking used oil storage containers or\ntanks prior to returning them to service; and\n(iii)\n\nWithin two hours of detecting a spill, discharge, or release of used oil, the facility owner or operator must notify\nthe department Spill Hotline at (800) 457-7362, or, if calling from out of\nstate, (518) 457-7362. (f) Tracking. (1)\n\nAcceptance. Used oil burners must ensure\nthat used oil is transported to their facilities only by transporters who are\npermitted, as required by Part 364 of this Title. Used oil burners are required\nto confirm that the transporters delivering used oil to their facilities carry\na valid Part 364 waste transporter permit, if required. Used oil burners must\nkeep a record of each used oil shipment accepted for burning. These records may\ntake the form of a log, invoice, manifest, bill of lading, or other shipping\ndocuments. Records for each shipment must include the following information: (i) the name and address of the transporter\nwho delivered the used oil to the burner; (ii)\nthe name and address of the generator, transfer facility, or processor/re-refiner from whom the used oil was sent to\nthe burner; (iii)\nthe EPA\nidentification number of the transporter who delivered the used oil to the\nburner; (iv)\nthe EPA identification\nnumber (if applicable) of the generator, transfer facility, or\nprocessor/re-refiner from whom the used oil was sent to the burner; (v) the quantity of used oil accepted; and\n(vi)\nthe date of\nacceptance. (2)\n\nRecord\nretention. The records described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision must be\nmaintained for at least seven years. (g) Notices. (1)\n\nCertification. Before a burner accepts\nthe first shipment of off-specification used oil fuel from a generator, transfer facility, transporter, or processor/re-refiner, the burner must\nprovide to the generator, transfer facility, transporter, or\nprocessor/re-refiner a one-time written and signed notice certifying that: (i) the burner has notified EPA and the\ndepartment office in the region in which the facility is located stating the\nlocation and general description of his or her used oil management activities; and\n(ii)\nthe burner will burn the\nused oil only in an industrial furnace or boiler identified in paragraph (b)(1)\nof this section. (2)\n\nCertification retention. The certification described in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision must be maintained for seven years from the date the burner last\nreceives shipment of off-specification used oil from that generator, transfer\nfacility, transporter, or processor/re-refiner. (h) Management of residues. Burners who generate residues from the storage or burning\nof used oil must manage the residues as specified in section\n374-2.2\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart. Notes\nN.Y.
