(b) Base flood shall mean the flood having a\none-percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. (c) Base flood level or base flood elevation\nshall mean the computed water surface elevation at a given location resulting\nfrom a flood having a one-percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any\ngiven year. (d) Breakaway wall\nshall mean a wall designed and intended to collapse under stress without\njeopardizing the structural integrity of a structure, so that the impact of\nabnormally high tides or wind-driven water on the structure is\nminimized. (e) Coastal high hazard\narea shall mean any coastal area subject to high velocity waters, including but\nnot limited to hurricanes. (f) Commence a project shall mean the initiation of any phase of a project, including any excavation or site preparation.

(j) Flood elevation determination\nshall mean a determination by the administrator of the water surface elevations\nof the base flood. (k) Flood hazard\narea shall mean the land in a floodplain within a city, town or village subject\nto a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. (l) Flood hazard boundary map or FHBM shall\nmean an official map of a city, town or village, on which the administrator has\ndelineated the boundaries of the flood hazard area in that\nmunicipality. (m) Flood insurance\nrate map or FIRM shall mean an official map of a city, town or village, on\nwhich the administrator has delineated both the flood hazard areas and the risk\npremium zones applicable to that municipality. (n) Floodplain shall mean any land\nsusceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of\nflood). (o) Floodproofing shall\nmean any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or\nadjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate\nor improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their\ncontents. (p) Habitable floor shall\nmean any floor usable for living purposes, which includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used only for\nstorage purposes is not a habitable floor. (q) Levee-protected area shall mean any land\nprotected, or proposed to be protected, from inundation by the base flood by an\nearthen embankment, concrete wall, or other substantial barrier specifically\ndesigned as a flood protection project. (r) Mean sea level (MSL) shall mean the\narithmetic mean of hourly water elevations observed over a specific 19-year\n\nMetonic cycle (the national tidal datum epoch), as determined by the National\n\nOcean Survey (mean sea level is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical\n\nDatum). (s) Mobile home shall mean\na structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a\npermanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent\nfoundation when connected to the required utilities. Mobile home shall not\ninclude recreational vehicles or travel trailers.

When used in this Part, the term shall be construed\nas though followed by the words \"or part or parts thereof\", unless the context\nclearly requires a different meaning. (bb)\n(1)\n\nSubstantial improvement shall mean any repair, reconstruction or improvement of\na structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the replacement\nvalue of the structure, either: (i) before the\nimprovement or repair is started; or\n(ii)\nif the structure has been damaged and is\nbeing restored, before the damage occurred. (2)\n\nFor the purposes of this definition, substantial improvementshall include an alteration of a wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not the external\ndimensions of the structure are changed. The term shall not include minor\nchanges to a structure to comply with existing Federal or State health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure\nsafe living conditions, and shall not include any expansion of a\nstructure. (cc)\n\nWater\nsurface elevation shall mean the projected height, in relation to mean sea\nlevel, reached by floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the\nfloodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
