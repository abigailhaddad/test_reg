  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 101.2 - Application for community afforded home office protection\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Banking Department will not accept applications for\nbranch offices in communities from which the applicant would be barred, at the\ntime of filing, under the home office protection provisions of the New York\n\nBanking Law; provided, however, such a branch application may be accepted for\nfiling if there exists on such date any application with the appropriate\nregulatory authorities which would, if approved, eliminate the protection\nprovisions of section 396 of the New York Banking Law. No final action will be\ntaken on such branch application until home office protection will have ceased\nunder New York Banking Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n101.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
