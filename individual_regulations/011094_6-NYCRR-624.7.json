  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 624.7 - Disclosure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Prior to the\nissues conference.' Disclosure is limited to what is afforded under Part 616 of\nthis Title (Access to Records). In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the ALJ will not grant petitions for further disclosure. This provision does\nnot alter the rights of any person under Part 616 of this Title nor does it\nlimit the ability of any party to seek disclosure after the issues\nconference. (b) 'Without permission\nof the ALJ.' Within ten (10) days after service of the final designation of the\nissues any party has the right to serve a disclosure demand upon any other\nparty demanding that party provide: (1)\ndocuments, in general conformance with CPLR 3120(a)(1)(i); (2)\na list of witnesses to be called, their\naddresses, and the scope and content of each witness's proposed testimony, and\nthe qualifications and published works of each, in general conformance with\nCPLR 3101(d)(1), except that disclosure of fact witnesses as well as expert\nwitnesses may be demanded; (3)\nan\ninspection of property, in general conformance with CPLR 3120(a)(1)(ii), except\nthat drilling and other intrusive sampling and testing is not provided as of\nright; (4)\na request for admission, in general conformance with CPLR 3123; (5)\nlists of documentary or physical evidence\nto be offered at the evidentiary hearing; or\n(6)\npotentially relevant electronically\nstored information (ESI) limited to active data only. (c) 'By permission.' With permission of the\nALJ, a party may: (1)\nobtain disclosure prior\nto the issues conference; (2)\nuse\ndisclosure devices from the CPLR not provided for in subdivision (b) of this\nsection; (3)\nsubmit late requests\nfor disclosure or vary the time for responding to requests; (4)\naccess real property in the custody or\ncontrol of another for the purpose of conducting drilling or other sampling or\ntesting. In that instance, all parties must be given notice of the proposed\nactivities and be allowed to observe, and full parties allowed to take split\nsamples or use other specified methods of verification; and\n(5)\nupon a demonstration of substantial\nprejudice, obtain disclosure of potentially relevant ESI not provided for in\nparagraph (b)(6) of this section, subject to any terms and conditions deemed\nappropriate by the ALJ. The motion for additional disclosure of potentially\nrelevant ESI must be accompanied by an affirmation of an attorney, or an\naffidavit of the moving party if not represented by an attorney, describing the\ngood faith efforts to resolve the dispute without resort to a motion. (d) 'Protective order and motion\nto compel.'\n(1)\nA party against whom\ndisclosure is demanded may make a motion to the ALJ for a protective order, in\ngeneral conformance with CPLR Section 3103, to deny, limit, condition or\nregulate the use of any disclosure device in order to prevent unreasonable\nannoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other prejudice. The motion\nmust be submitted within ten (10) days of the disclosure demand and must be\naccompanied by an affirmation of an attorney, or an affidavit of the moving\nparty or other authorized representative if not represented by an attorney, describing the good faith efforts to resolve the dispute without resort to a\nmotion. (2)\n\nIf a party fails to\ncomply with a disclosure demand without having made a timely objection, the\nproponent of the disclosure demand may apply to the ALJ to compel disclosure. The motion must be accompanied by an affirmation of an attorney, or an\naffidavit of the moving party or other authorized representative if not\nrepresented by an attorney, describing the good faith efforts to resolve the\ndispute without resort to a motion. (3)\n\nSanctions. Upon failure by a party to\ncomply with a ruling or order by the ALJ or the commissioner to produce\nmaterial or information demanded in disclosure, the ALJ or commissioner may\nexclude the material or information. In addition, the ALJ or the commissioner\nmay draw an adverse inference regarding the non-producing party with respect to\nthe material or information the party did not produce or grant other\nappropriate relief consistent with CPLR 3126. The award of attorneys' fees or\nother costs is not authorized. (e) 'Pre-filed testimony.' The ALJ may\nrequire the submission of pre-filed written testimony for expert witnesses. Pre-filed written testimony must be attested to at the evidentiary hearing and\nthe witness must be available to be cross-examined on the testimony, unless\notherwise stipulated by the parties and directed by the ALJ. Whenever the ALJ\nrequires the submission of pre-filed testimony, the testimony must provide, or\nmust be accompanied by a technical report that provides, a full explanation of\nthe basis for the views set forth therein, including data, tables, protocols, computations, formulae, and any other information necessary for verification of\nthe views set forth, as well as a bibliography of reports, studies and other\ndocuments relied upon. Upon ten (10) days notice (which time may be shortened\nor extended by the ALJ) the party submitting pre-filed testimony may also be\nrequired to make available all raw data, well logs, laboratory notes, and other\nbasic materials, as well as all items on the bibliography provided. Whenever\npre-filed testimony is not required, any party may demand, from any other party\nor the department propounding an expert witness, all backup information that\nwould be required in connection with pre-filed testimony. (f) 'Subpoenas.' Consistent with the CPLR, any attorney of record in a proceeding under this Part has the power to issue\nsubpoenas. A party who is not represented by an attorney admitted to practice\nin New York State may request the ALJ or, if no ALJ has been assigned to the\nproceeding, the Chief ALJ, to issue a subpoena, stating the items or witnesses\nneeded by the party to present its case. The service of a subpoena is the\nresponsibility of its sponsor. A subpoena must give notice that the ALJ may\nquash or modify the subpoena pursuant to the standards set forth under CPLR\narticle 23. This Part does not affect the authority of an attorney of record\nfor any party to issue subpoenas under the provisions of CPLR 2302. A subpoena\nduces tecum to be served upon a library, other department or bureau of a\nmunicipal corporation or of the State, or an officer thereof, requiring the\nproduction of any books, papers or other things, may be issued consistent with\nCPLR 2307 by the ALJ assigned to the proceeding or, if no ALJ has been assigned\nto the proceeding, the Chief ALJ. (g) When department staff seeks the\nrevocation of a license or permit previously granted by the department, either\nparty must, upon demand and at least seven (7) days prior to the evidentiary\nhearing, disclose the evidence that the party intends to introduce at the\nevidentiary hearing, including documentary evidence and identification of\nwitnesses; provided, however, the provisions of this subdivision do not require\nthe disclosure of information or material otherwise protected by law from\ndisclosure, including information and material protected because of privilege\nor confidentiality. If, after the disclosure, a party determines to rely upon\nother witnesses or documentary evidence, the party must, as soon as\npracticable, supplement its disclosure by providing the names of the witnesses\nor the documentary evidence.
