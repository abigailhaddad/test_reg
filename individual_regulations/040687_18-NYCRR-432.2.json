Each local child protective service must establish\na procedure to review and evaluate the backgrounds of and information supplied\nby all applicants for employment in the local child protective service. This\nprocedure must take into account any appropriate collective bargaining\nagreements and applicable provisions of the Civil Service Law.

(ii)\n\nIf an applicant discloses in the sworn\nstatement furnished in accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph that\nhe/she has been convicted of a crime, the local child protective service must\ndetermine, in accordance with guidelines developed and disseminated by OCFS, whether to hire any such applicant, except that any local child protective\nservice which had guidelines for the review of persons with conviction records\nin use prior to January 1, 1986 may continue to use the district guidelines in\nmaking the required determination. If the service determines it will hire the\napplicant, the service must maintain a written record, as part of the\napplication file or employment or other personnel record of such person, of the\nreason(s) why such person was determined to be appropriate and acceptable as an\nemployee. (iii)\n\nEach local child\nprotective service must inquire of OCFS whether any person who is actively\nbeing considered for employment or any person who is employed by an individual, corporation, partnership or association which provides goods or services to the\nlocal child protective service and who will have the potential for regular and\nsubstantial contact with children being cared for by the child protective\nservice is the subject of an indicated report of child abuse or maltreatment on\nfile with the State Central Register. The local child protective service may\nmake such an inquiry to OCFS regarding any current employee or a person who is\nbeing considered for use as a volunteer or for hiring as a consultant and who\nhas or will have the potential for regular and substantial contact with\nchildren being cared for by the service. An inquiry regarding any current\nemployee may be made only once in any six-month period. Inquiries made pursuant\nto this paragraph shall be subject to the following provisions. (a) Prior to making an inquiry to OCFS, the\nlocal child protective service must notify, in the form prescribed by OCFS, the\nperson who will be the subject of the inquiry that an inquiry will be made to\ndetermine whether such person is the subject of an indicated report of child\nabuse or maltreatment on file with the State Central Register. (b) (1)\n\nExcept as set forth in subclause (2) of this clause, a child protective service\nmay not permit a person hired by the service or a person who is employed by an\nindividual, corporation, partnership or association which provides goods or\nservices to the service to have contact with children in the care of the\nservice prior to obtaining the result of the inquiry required by this\nsubparagraph. (2)\n\nAn employee of a\nchild protective service or an employee of a provider of goods and services to\nthe child protective service may have contact with children cared for by the\nservice prior to the receipt by the service of the result of the inquiry\nrequired by this subparagraph only where such employee is visually observed or\naudibly monitored by an existing staff member of the service. Such employee\nmust be in the physical presence of an existing staff member for whom: (i) the result of an inquiry required by\nsection\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law has been received by the child protective service and\nthe service hired the existing staff member with knowledge of the result of the\ninquiry; or\n(ii)\nan inquiry was not\nmade because such staff member was hired before the effective date of section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law. (c) (1)\n\nWhen the person who is the subject of the inquiry is an applicant for\nemployment, a fee, as established by law, will be charged by OCFS when it\nconducts a search of its records within the State Central Register to determine\nwhether such applicant is the subject of an indicated report. (2)\n\nThe required fee must either accompany\nthe inquiry form submitted to OCFS or, for an inquiry submitted by a social\nservices district, the district may elect to have the fee subtracted from its\nclaims for reimbursement submitted pursuant to section\n601.1\nof this Title. (3)\n\nFees must be paid in a manner specified\nby OCFS \"New York State Office of Children and Family Services\". For social\nservices districts electing to have the fees subtracted from their claims for\nreimbursement submitted pursuant to section\n601.1\nof this Title, the fees will\nbe subtracted quarterly to match the number of inquiries made. Personal checks\nand cash are not acceptable forms of payment. (d) If, an applicant, employee, or other\nperson about whom the service has made an inquiry is found to be the subject of\nan indicated report of child abuse or maltreatment, the local child protective\nservice must determine, on the basis of information it has available and in\naccordance with guidelines developed and disseminated by OCFS, whether to hire, retain or use the person as an employee, volunteer, or consultant or permit the\nperson providing goods or services to have access to children being cared for\nby the service, except that any local child protective service which had\nguidelines for the review of persons who are subjects of indicated reports of\nchild abuse or maltreatment in use prior to January 1, 1986 may continue to use\nthe local guidelines in making the required determination. Whenever such person\nis hired, retained, used or given access to children, the child protective\nservice must maintain a written record, as part of the application file or\nemployment or other personnel record of any such person, of the specific\nreason(s) why such person was determined to be appropriate and acceptable as an\nemployee, volunteer, consultant or provider of goods with access to children\nbeing cared for by the service. (e) If the local child protective service denies employment or makes a decision not\nto retain an employee, use a volunteer, hire a consultant, or not permit a\nperson providing goods or services to have access to children being cared for\nby the child protective service, the service must provide a written statement\nto the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant, or other such person\nindicating whether the denial or decision was based in whole or in part on the\nexistence of the indicated report and, if so, the reasons for the denial or\ndecision. If the denial or decision is based in whole or in part on the\nexistence of such report of child abuse or maltreatment the statement must also\ninclude, in the form prescribed by OCFS, written notification to the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant or other person that: (1)\nhe/she has the right, pursuant to section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, to request a hearing regarding the record maintained\nby the State Central Register; (2)\nA request for such a hearing must be made within 90 days of the receipt of the\nnotice of denial or decision indicating that the denial or decision was based\nin whole or in part on the existence of the indicated report; and\n(3)\nthe sole issue at any such hearing will\nbe whether the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant, or other person has\nbeen shown by a fair preponderance of the evidence to have committed the act or\nacts of child abuse or maltreatment giving rise to the indicated\nreport. (f) If in a\nhearing held pursuant to a request made in accordance with clause (c) of this\nsubparagraph and section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, OCFS fails to show by a fair preponderance of the\nevidence that the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant, or other person\ncommitted the act or acts upon which the indicated report is based, OCFS must\nnotify the local child protective service which made the inquiry to OCFS that, pursuant to the hearing decision, the decision of the service to deny the\napplication, discharge the employee, or not to use the volunteer, not to hire\nthe person as a consultant, or not to permit the person providing goods or\nservices to have access to children being cared for by the service should be\nreconsidered. Upon receiving such notification from OCFS, the local child\nprotective service should review its decision without considering the indicated\nreport. (iv)\n\nReimbursement by OCFS will be withheld from a local social services district\nfor the salary of any employee of the local child protective service who does\nnot comply with the background review, educational, experience or training\nrequirements of this paragraph or paragraph (5) of this subdivision.
