[*]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, it is the established policy of the State of New\n\nYork to award State contracts to the lowest responsible and reliable bidder \"as\nwill best promote the public interest\"; and\nWHEREAS, the phrase \"as will best promote the public\ninterest\" has been interpreted by the courts to encompass labor relations\nconsiderations; and\nWHEREAS, the labor relations practices of a bidder, its\nsupplier or subcontractor can affect the bidder's reliability, its ability to\nperform the contract in a timely manner, or to meet the requisite quality or\nother standards for the articles or services to be supplied; and\nWHEREAS, the capability of vendors and contractors to\ncomply with all State contract requirements is a matter of economic concern to\nthe State of New York: NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby direct all State agencies which are\nauthorized by law to award State contracts to consider, when determining the\nresponsibility of a bidder in accordance with any practice or procedure\nrequired by law or regulation governing the awarding of State contracts, the\nlabor relations practices of the bidder and its known supplier or\nsubcontractor, whenever it has come to the agency's attention that such\npractices could disqualify the bidder as a responsible and reliable bidder\nunder the applicable statutory and administrative criteria. Each contracting\nagency shall notify the Commissioner of Labor of any bidder, supplier or\nsubcontractor whose labor relations practices have been found by such agency to\nhave so disqualified a bidder. The Commissioner of Labor shall maintain a file\nof such parties and shall make such information available at the request of any\ncontracting agency. All State departments and agencies are directed to provide\nany additional information and assistance requested by a contracting agency as\nnecessary to carry out the purposes of this Order. Executive Order Number 70, dated March 1, 1978, is revoked and superseded by this Executive Order. Signed: Mario M. Cuomo\n\nDated: February 25, 1983\n\nFootnotes\n*\n[Revokes and supersedes\n\nExecutive Order No. 70 (Hugh L. Carey) §\n3.70, supra. ]\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
