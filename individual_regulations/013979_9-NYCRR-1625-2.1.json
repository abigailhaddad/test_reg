  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1625-2.1 - Responsibility to public\n\nState Regulations\n\nHousing authority members bear the high responsibility\nof public trust which is rightfully expected from public officers. Members are\nentrusted with the custody of assets representing millions of dollars of public\nfunds as well as administrative control of annual expenditures of hundreds of\nthousands of dollars. The custody and control of such public funds require each\nmember to ensure that buildings, grounds and other assets are kept up to high\nstandards so that their value is not impaired and that the annual operating\nexpenditures are wisely and economically spent. Members must exercise judicious\ncontrol of the premises entrusted in their care, including the use of community\nroom and public spaces. In this regard, division policy does not permit\ncommunity room and public spaces to be used for partisan political activities\nor sectarian religious purposes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1625-2.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
