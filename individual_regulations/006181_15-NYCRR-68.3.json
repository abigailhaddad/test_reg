  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 68.3 - Specifications and standards\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe SMV emblem shall consist of a fluorescent yellow-orange\ntriangle with a dark red reflective border. The yellow-orange fluorescent\ntriangle is for daylight identification. The reflective border defines the\nshape of the fluorescent color in daylight and becomes a hollow red triangle in\nthe path of motor vehicle headlights at night. The emblem shall meet the\nfollowing specifications: (a) Size. The dimensions shall be as shown in Figure 1 below. Click\nto view image\n(b) Visibility. The SMV emblem shall be entirely visible in daylight and at\nnight from all distances between 600 and 100 feet from the rear when directly\nin front of lawful upper beam of headlights. The operator and/or owner of a\nslow-moving vehicle shall exercise due care in the maintenance and cleaning of\nthe emblem to assure it being plainly visible. (c) Color and reflectivity. (1)\n\nThe spectrophotometric color values of\nthe yellow-orange fluorescent material shall have a dominant wave length of\n590-610 millimicrons and a purity of 98 percent before test. After durability\ntest, (section\n68.4\n[b]\n), the\ndominant wave length of the fluorescent material shall not change more than 10\npercent. (2)\n\nThe reflective\nmaterial shall have minimum luminance values at each of the angles listed per\ntable 1.

The\nmaximum dimension of the test surface shall not be greater than 1.5 times the\nminimum dimension. The reflective intensity (R) is computed from the\nequation. R =\n(Lr) (d2)\n/\n(Ls)\n(A)\n\nWhere\nR = reflective intensity, candlepower per incident\nfoot-candle per square foot\n\nLr = illumination incident upon receiver at observation\npoint, foot-candles\n\nLs = illumination incident upon a plane perpendicular to\nthe incident ray at the test specimen position, foot candles\nd = distance from test specimen to source of illumination =\n100 feet (as specified in SAE J594), feet\nA = area of test surface, square feet\n(d) Durability. Note: These requirements are minimal and do not preclude the use\nof materials having superior performance. (1)\n\nThe reflective and fluorescent materials\nshall be tough, flexible and of sufficient thickness and strength to meet the\nrequirements of sections\n68.3\nand\n68.4. After the durability test, (section\n68.4\n[b]\n), the\nfluorescent and reflective material shall show no appreciable discoloration, cracking, crazing, blistering, loss of durable bond, or dimensional\nchange. (2)\n\nBacking material for\nportable SMV emblems shall be equivalent to 0.040 inches (0.1016 millimeters)\nminimum thickness aluminum, 22-gauge (0.030 inches or 0.76 millimeters) minimum\nthickness mill-galvanized or coated sheet steel with the surface clean and\nreceptive to a durable bond. The backing material shall be free of burrs.

The\nmaximum dimension of the test surface shall not be greater than 1.5 times the\nminimum dimension. The reflective intensity (R) is computed from the\nequation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n68.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
