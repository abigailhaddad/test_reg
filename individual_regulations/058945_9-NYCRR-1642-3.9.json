  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.9 - Expense analysis ledger\n\nState Regulations\nA separate expense analysis ledger, using the 4000 and\n6000 groups of detailed expense accounts, and controlled, subsequent to the\ndate of substantial completion, by an account or accounts in the general ledger\n(depending on whether single or multiple general ledger controls are being\noperated) shall be maintained for each project, beginning with the first day of\nthe initial operating period, to record all expenses, operating and\nnonoperating, chargeable to project revenues. Separate expense analysis\nledgers, using the 4000 group of detailed expense accounts to record the\nexpenses chargeable to the revenues derived from the operation of the\nrespective properties, shall also be maintained for each related program and\nfor the project site prior to demolition and construction. The division may\nfurther require, depending on the circumstances, that separate expense analysis\nledgers be maintained, prior and subsequent to construction, for each site\nincluded in a multiple development project, in which case the local agency will\nbe so advised. The expense analysis ledger set up to record the expenses\nchargeable to revenues derived from the operation of the site prior [to]\ndemolition and construction may also be used during the initial operating\nperiod, but it is preferable to set up a new expense analysis ledger upon the\ninitial occupancy of the newly constructed buildings and to carry this ledger\nforward into the operating period. The control of the expense analysis ledger\nduring the initial operating period by account 1470.3 has been described in\nsection\n1642-3.8. Account 4000, the Expense\n\nControl Account, in the general ledger comes into operation only with the date\nof substantial completion and controls all expenses, both operating (4000\ngroup) and nonoperating (6000 group) thereafter. Individual postings to the\nexpense analysis ledger shall be made directly from the accounts payable and\njournal vouchers. Occasional postings may originate from the books of original\nentry. The expense analysis ledger, like the cost and income analysis ledgers, may consist of a card or a loose-leaf sheet for each expense account, as per\n\nExhibit 16 of Appendix S-8, or, alternatively, of a loose-leaf sheet for each\nsubgroup of expense accounts with columns for the individual accounts, as per\n\nExhibit 17 of Appendix S-8. The former is recommended for the reasons described\nin section\n1642-3.8. Expense analysis ledger\nsheets are provided by the local agency. Stock forms for either specimen, or\nforms which may be adapted, may be procured at most stationers, either without\nprinting or overprinted. At the end of each month, after all postings have been\nmade, the expense analysis ledger is footed and the total for each account as\nof the end of that month is determined, and a trial balance to agree with the\ncontrols taken exactly as for the income analysis ledger (see §\n1642-3.8\n). It will not be necessary\nto head up a new expense analysis ledger sheet for each new month, if space\nremains on the sheet for the previous month. Alternative procedures for\ndetermining and recording previous, current, and cumulative expenses, as by a\ndifferent columnar arrangement of the expense analysis ledger sheet or by\nmachine-bookkeeping, may be adopted by the local agency. The suggested forms\nmay be expanded, if the local agency desires, by providing separate columns for\nlabor and materials under the individual expense classifications. Where\nloose-leaf sheets are used, the expense analysis ledger should be kept in the\nsame binder with the related income analysis ledger. Where the division has\ndirected the maintenance of separate expense analysis ledgers for the various\nsites included in a multiple development project, consideration may be given to\ntheir consolidation when the project as a whole has been substantially\ncompleted and bonds have been issued. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
