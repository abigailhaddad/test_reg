(b) All items as defined in.1(c), are subject to requirements\nof this standard..3\n\nGeneral Requirements-\n(a) Summary\nof Test Method. Five conditioned Specimens, 8.9 × 25.4 cm. (3.5\n× 10 in.), are suspended one at a time vertically in holders in a\nprescribed cabinet and subjected to a standard flame along their bottom edge\nfor a specified time under controlled conditions. The char length and residual\nflame time are measured. (b) Test Criteria. The test criteria when the\ntesting is done in accordance with \".4 Test Procedure\" are: (1)\n\nAverage Char Length. The average char\nlength of five specimens shall not exceed 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.). (2)\n\nFull Specimen Burn. No individual specimen\nshall have a char length of 25.4 cm. (10 in.). (3)\n\nResidual Flame Time. No individual\nspecimen shall have a residual flame time greater than 10 seconds..4\n\nTest Procedure-\n(a) Apparatus\n-(1)\n\nTest Chamber. The test chamber\nshall be a steel cabinet with inside dimensions of 32.9 cm. (12\n15\n/\n16\nin.) wide, 32.9 cm. (12\n15\n/\n16\nin.) deep, and 76.2 cm. (30 in.) high. It shall have a frame which permits the suspension\nof the specimen holder over the center of the base of the cabinet at such a\nheight that the bottom of the specimen holder is 1.7 cm. (3/4 in.) above the\nhighest point of the barrel of the gas burner specified in.4(a) (3) and\nperpendicular to the front of the cabinet. The front of the cabinet shall be a\nclose fitting door with a glass insert to permit observation of the entire\ntest. The cabinet floor shall be covered with a piece of asbestos paper, whose\nlength and width are approximately 2.5 cm. (1 in.) less than the cabinet floor\ndimensions and whose thickness is a nominal 0.3 cm. (\n1\n/\n8\nin.). A piece of\nasbestos paper at least 15.2 × 15.2 cm. (6 × 6 in.) and of nominal\nthickness of 0.15 cm. (\n1\n/\n16\nin.) or less shall be used to catch the drips or other fragments and this\nlatter paper shall be changed after each specimen which drips has been tested. The cabinet to be used in this test method is illustrated in Figure 1 and\ndetailed in Engineering Drawings, Nos. 1 to 7. (2)\n\nSpecimen Holder. The specimen holder is\ndesigned to permit suspension of the specimen in a fixed vertical position and\nto prevent curling of the specimen when the flame is applied. It shall consist\nof two U-shaped 0.20 cm. (14 ga. USS) thick steel plates, 42.2 cm. (16\n5\n/\n8\nin.) long, and 8.9 cm. (3.5 in.) wide, with aligning pins. The openings in the plates shall be 35.6\ncm. (14 in.) long and 5.1 cm. (2 in.) wide. The specimen shall be fixed between\nthe plates, which shall be held together with side clamps. The holder to be\nused in this test method is illustrated in Figure 2 and detailed in Engineering\n\nDrawing No. 7. (3)\n\nBurner. The burner shall be substantially\nthe same as that illustrated in Figure 1 and detailed in Engineering Drawing\n\nNo. 6. It shall have a tube of 1.1 cm. (0.43 in.) Inside diameter. The input\nline to the burner shall be equipped with a needle value. It shall have a\nvariable orifice to adjust the height of the flame. The barrel of the burner\nshall be at an angle of 25° from the vertical. The burner shall be equipped\nwith an adjustable stop collar so that it may be positioned quickly under the\ntest specimen. The burner shall be connected to the gas source by rubber or\nother flexible tubing. (4)\n\nGas Supply System. There shall be a\npressure regulator to furnish gas to the burner under a pressure of 129\n± 13 mm. Hg (2 1/2 ± 1/4 lbs. per sq. in.) at the burner\ninlet. (5)\n\nGas. The gas shall be at least 97 percent\npure methane. (6)\n\nHooks and Weights. Metal hooks and weights\nshall be used to produce a series of loads for char length determinations. Suitable metal hooks consist of No. 19 gauge steel wire, or equivalent, made\nfrom 7.6 cm. (3 in.) lengths of the wire, bent 1.3 cm. (0.5 in.) from one end\nto a 45° angle hook. The longer end of the wire is fastened around the neck\nof the weight to be used and the other in the lower end of each burned specimen\nto one side of the burned area. The requisite loads are given in Table\n1. TABLE 1-ORIGINAL FABRIC\nWEIGHT\n1\ng./sq. m. (oz./sq. yd.)\n\nLoads\ng. (lb.)\n\nLess than 101....... (Less than 3.0)....... 54.4\n(0.12)\n101 to 207....... (3.0 to 6.0)....... 113.4\n(.25)\n207 to 338....... (6.0 to 10.0)....... 226.8\n(.50)\n\nGreater than 338....... (Greater than 10.0)........ 340.2\n(.75)\n1 Weight of the original fabric, containing no seams or trim, is calculated from the weight of a specimen which has been conditioned for at\nleast 8 hours at 21±1.1°C. (70±2°F.) and 65±2\npercent relative humidity. Shorter conditioning times may be used if the change\nin weight of a specimen in successive weighings made at intervals of not less\nthan 2 hours does not exceed 0.2 percent of the weight of the specimen. (7)\n\nStopwatch. A stopwatch or similar timing\ndevice shall be used to measure time to 0.1 second. (8)\n\nScale. A linear scale graduated in\nmillimeters or 0.1 inch divisions shall be used to measure char length. (9)\n\nCirculating Air Oven. A forced circulation\ndrying oven capable of maintaining the specimens at 105±2.8° C. (221±5° F.), shall be used to dry the specimen while mounted in the\nspecimen holders. 2\n(10)\n\nDesiccator. An air-tight and\nmoisture-tight desiccating chamber shall be used for cooling mounted specimens\nafter drying. Anhydrous silica gel shall be used as the desiccant in the\ndesiccating chamber. (11)\n\nHood. A hood or other suitable enclosure\nshall be used to provide a draft-free environment surrounding the test chamber, This enclosure shall have a fan or other suitable means for exhausting smoke\nand/or toxic gases produced by testing. (b) Specimens and Sampling\n-(1)\n\nGeneral. The test criteria of.3(b) shall be used in\nconjunction with the following fabric and garment sampling plan, or any other\napproved by the Department of Commerce that provides at least the equivalent\nlevel of fire safety to the consumer. Alternate sampling plans submitted for\napproval shall have operating characteristics such that the probability of Unit\nacceptance at any percentage defective does not exceed the corresponding\nprobability of Unit acceptance of the following sampling plan in the region of\nthe latter's operating characteristic curves that lies between 5 and 95 percent\nacceptance probability. Different colors or different print patterns of the same fabric\nmay be included in a single Fabric or Garment Production Unit, provided such\ncolors or print patterns demonstrate char lengths and residual flame times that\nare not significantly different from each other as determined by previous\ntesting of at least three Samples from each color or print pattern to be\nincluded in the Unit. Garments with different trim and findings may be included in a\nsingle Garment Production Unit providing the other garment characteristics are\nidentical except for size, color, and print pattern. For fabrics whose flammability characteristics are not\ndependent on chemical additives or chemical reactants to fiber, yarns, or\nfabrics, the laundering requirement of.4(d) (4) is met on subsequent Fabric\n\nProduction Units if results of testing an initial Fabric Production Unit\ndemonstrate acceptability according to the requirements of.4(b) (2), Normal\n\nSampling, both before and after the appropriate laundering. If the fabric has been shown to meet the laundering\nrequirement,.4(d) (4), the garments produced from that fabric are not required\nto be laundered. Each Sample (five specimens) for all Fabric Sampling shall be\nselected so that two specimens are in one fabric direction (machine or\ncross-machine) and three specimens are in the other fabric direction except for\nthe additional Sample selected after a failure, in which case, all five\nspecimens shall be selected in the same fabric direction in which the specimen\nfailure occurred. Fabric Samples may be selected from fabric as outlined in.4(b)\n(2) Fabric Sampling or, for verification purposes, from randomly selected\ngarments. Multilayer fabrics shall be tested with a hem of approximately\n2.5 cm. (1 in.) sewn at the bottom edge of the specimen with a suitable thread\nand stitch. The specimen shall include each of the components over its entire\nlength. Garments manufactured from multilayer fabrics shall be tested with the\nedge finish at the bottom edge of the specimen which is used in the\ngarment. (2)\n\nFabric Sampling. A Fabric Production Unit\n(Unit) is either accepted or rejected in accordance with the following\nplan: Normal Sampling. Select one Sample from the\nbeginning of the first Fabric Piece (Piece) in the Unit and one Sample from the\nend of the last Piece in the Unit, or select a sample from each end of the\n\nPiece if the Unit is made up of only one Piece. Test the two selected Samples. If both Samples meet all the Test Criteria of.3(b), accept the unit. If either\nor both of the Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length\ncriterion,.3(b) (1), reject the Unit. If two or more of the individual\nspecimens, from the 10 selected specimens fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char\nlength,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10 second residual flame time criteria,.3(b)\n(3), reject the Unit. If only one individual specimen, from the 10 selected\nspecimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10\nsecond residual flame time criteria,.3(b) (3), select five additional\nspecimens from the same end of the Piece in which the failure occurred, all\nfive to be taken in the fabric direction in which the specimen failure\noccurred. If this additional Sample passes all the test criteria, accept the\n\nUnit. If this additional Sample fails any part of the test criteria, reject the\n\nUnit. Reduced Sampling. The level of sampling\nrequired for fabric acceptance may be reduced provided the preceding 15 Units\nof the fabric have all been accepted using the Normal Sampling plan. The Reduced Sampling plan shall be the same as for Normal\n\nSampling except that the quantity of fabric in the Unit may be increased to\n10,000 linear yards. Select and test two Samples in the same manner as in Normal\n\nSampling. Accept or reject the Unit on the same basis as with Normal\n\nSampling. Reduced Sampling shall be discontinued and Normal Sampling\nresumed if a Unit is rejected. Tightened Sampling. The level of sampling\nrequired for acceptance shall be increased when a Unit is rejected under the\n\nNormal Sampling plan. The Tightened Sampling shall be the same as Normal\n\nSampling except that one additional Sample shall be selected and cut from a\nmiddle Piece in the Unit. If the Unit is made up of less than two Pieces, the\n\nUnit shall be divided into at least two Pieces. The division shall be such that\nthe Pieces produced by the division shall not be smaller than 100 linear yards\nor greater than 2,500 linear yards. If the Unit is made up of two Pieces, the\nadditional Sample shall be selected from the interior end of one of the Pieces. Test the three selected Samples. If all three selected Samples meet all the\ntest criteria of.3(b), accept the Unit. If one or more of the three selected\n\nSamples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion,.3(b) (1), reject the Unit. If two or more of the individual specimens, from the 15\nselected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or\nthe 10 second residual flame time criteria,.3(b) (3), reject the unit. If only\none individual specimen, of the 15 Selected Specimens fails the 25.4 cm. (10\nin.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10 second residual flame time criteria,.3(b) (3), select five additional specimens from the same end of the same Piece\nin which the failure occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in\nwhich the Specimen failure occurred. if this additional Sample passes all the\ntest criteria, accept the Unit. If this additional Sample fails any part of the\ntest criteria, reject the Unit. Tightened Sampling may be discontinued and\n\nNormal Sampling resumed after five consecutive Units have all been accepted\nusing Tightened Sampling. If Tightened Sampling remains in effect for 15\nconsecutive Units, production of the specific fabric in Tightened Sampling must\nbe discontinued until that part of the process or component which is causing\nfailure has been identified and the quality of the end product has been\nimproved. Disposition of Rejected Units. The Piece or\n\nPieces which have failed and resulted in the initial rejection of the Unit may\nnot be retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined\nin.1(a) except after reworking to improve the flammability characteristics and\nsubsequent retesting in accordance with the procedures in Tightened\n\nSampling. The remainder of a rejected Unit, after removing the Piece or\n\nPieces the failure of which resulted in Unit rejection, may be accepted if the\nfollowing test plan is successfully concluded at all required locations. The\nrequired locations are those adjacent to each such failed Piece. (Required\nlocations exist on both sides of the \"Middle Piece\" tested in Tightened\n\nSampling if failure of that Piece resulted in Unit rejection.) Failure of a\n\nPiece shall be deemed to have resulted in Unit rejection if Unit rejection\noccurred and a Sample or specimen from the Piece failed any test criterion of.3(b). The Unit should contain at least 15 Pieces for disposition\ntesting after removing the falling Pieces. If necessary for this purpose, the\n\nUnit shall be demarcated into at least 15 approximately equal length Pieces\nunless such division results in Pieces shorter than 100 linear yards. In this\nlatter case, the Unit shall be demarcated into roughly equal length Pieces of\napproximately 100 linear yards each. If such a division results in five Pieces\nor less in the Unit for each failing Piece after removing the failing Pieces, only the individual Piece retest procedure (described subsequently) may be\nused. Select and cut a Sample from each end of each adjoining Piece\nbeginning adjacent to the Piece which failed. Test the two Samples from the\n\nPiece. If both Samples meet all the test criteria of.3(b), the Piece is\nacceptable. If one or both of the two selected Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0\nin.) average char length criterion,.3(b) (1), the Piece is unacceptable. If\ntwo or more of the individual Specimens, from the 10 selected specimens, fail\nthe 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10 second residual\nflame time criteria,.3(b) (3), the Piece is unacceptable. If only one\nindividual specimens, from the 10 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10\nin.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10 second residual flame time criteria,.3(b) (3), select five additional specimens from the same end of the Piece in\nwhich the failure occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in\nwhich the specimen failure occurred. If this additional Sample passes all the\ntest criteria, the Piece is acceptable. If this additional Sample fails any\npart of the test criteria, the Piece is unacceptable. Continue testing adjoining Pieces until a Piece has been found\nacceptable. Then continue testing adjoining Pieces until three successive\nadjoining Pieces, not including the first acceptable Piece, have been found\nacceptable or until five such Pieces not including the first acceptable Piece, have been tested, whichever occurs sooner. Unless three successive adjoining\n\nPieces have been found acceptable among five such Pieces, testing shall be\nstopped and the entire Unit rejected without further testing. If three\nsuccessive Pieces have been found acceptable among five such Pieces, accept the\nthree successive acceptable Pieces and the remaining Pieces in the Unit. Alternatively, individual Pieces from a rejected Unit\ncontaining three or more Pieces may be tested and accepted or rejected on a\n\nPiece-by-Piece basis according to the following plan, after removing the Piece\nor Pieces, the failure of which resulted in Unit rejection. Select four Samples (two from each end) from the Piece. Test\nthe four selected Samples. If all four Samples meet all the Test Criteria of.3(b), accept the Piece. If one or more of the Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7\nin.) average char length criterion,.3(b) (1), reject the Piece. If two or more\nof the individual Specimens, from the 20 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (1), and/or the 10 second residual flame time\ncriteria,.3(b) (3), reject the Piece. If only one individual specimen, from\nthe 20 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10 second residual flame time criteria,.3(b) (3), select two\nadditional Samples from the same end of the Piece in which the failure\noccurred. If these additional two Samples meet all the Test Criteria of.3(b), accept the Piece. If one or both of the two additional Samples fail any part of\nthe Test Criteria, reject the Piece. The Pieces of a Unit rejected after retesting may not be\nretested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined in.1(a)\nexcept after reworking to improve the flammability characteristics, and\nsubsequent retesting in accordance with the procedures set forth in Tightened\n\nSampling, Records. Records of all Unit sizes, test\nresults, and the disposition of rejected Pieces and Units must be maintained by\nthe manufacturer upon the effective date of this Standard. Rules and\nregulations may be established by the Federal Trade Commission. (3)\n\nGarment Sampling. The garment sampling\nplan is made up of two parts: (1) Prototype Testing and (2) Production Testing. Prior to production, prototypes must be tested to assure that the design\ncharacteristics of the garment are acceptable. Garment Production Units (Units)\nare then accepted or rejected on an individual Unit basis. Edge finishes such as hems and binding are excluded from\ntesting except that when trim is used on an edge the trim must be subjected to\nprototype testing. Seams attaching findings are excluded from testing. Prototype Testing. Preproduction prototypes of\na garment style or type shall be tested to assure that satisfactory garment\nspecifications in terms of flammability are set up prior to production. Seams. Make three Samples (15 specimens) using\nthe longest seam type and three Samples using each other seam type 10 inches or\nlonger that is to be included in the garment. Prior to testing, assign each\nspecimen to one of the three Samples. Test each set of three Samples and accept\nor reject each seam design in accordance with the following plan: If all three Samples meet all the test criteria of.3(b), accept the seam design. If one or more of the three Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion,.3(b) (1), reject the seam design. If\nthree or more of the individual Specimens from the 15 selected specimens fail\nthe 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10 second residual\nflame time criteria,.3(b) (3) reject the seam design. If only one of the\nindividual specimens from the 15 selected specimens fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.)\nchar length,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10 second residual flame time criteria,.3(b) (3), accept the seam design. If two of the individual specimens, from the 15 selected\nspecimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10\nsecond residual flame time criteria,.3(b) (3), select three more Samples (15\nspecimens) and retest. If all three additional Samples meet all the test\ncriteria of.3(b), accept the seam design. If one or more of the three\nadditional Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion,.3\n(b) (1), reject the seam design. If two or more of the individual specimens, from the 15\nselected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or\nthe 10 second residual flame time criteria,.3(b) (3), reject the seam design. If only one of the individual specimens, from the 15 selected specimens, fail\nthe 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10 second residual\nflame time criteria,.3(b) (3), accept the seam design. Trim. Make three Samples (15 specimens) from\neach type of trim to be included in the garment. Specimens shall be prepared by\nsewing or attaching the trim to the center of the vertical axis of an\nappropriate section of untrimmed fabric, beginning the sewing or attachment at\nthe lower edge of each specimen. The sewing or attachment shall be made in the\nmanner in which the trim is to be attached in the garment. Sewing or otherwise attaching the trim shall be done with\nthread or fastening material of the same composition and size to be used for\nthis purpose in the garment and using the same stitching or seam type. The trim\nshall be sewn or fastened the entire length of the specimen. Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three Samples. Test the sets of three\n\nSamples and accept or reject the type of trim and design on the same basis as\nseam design. Production Testing. A Unit is either accepted\nor rejected according to the following plan: From each Unit select at random sufficient garments and cut\nthree Samples (15 specimens) from the longest seam type. No more than five\nspecimens may be cut from a single garment. Prior to testing, assign each\nspecimen to one of the three Samples. All specimens cut from a single garment\nmust be included in the same Sample. Test the three selected Samples. If all\nthree Samples meet all the test criteria of.3(b), accept the Unit. If one or\nmore of the three Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length\ncriterion,.3(b) (1), reject the Unit. If four or more of the individual\nspecimens, from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char\nlength,.3(b) (2), and/or the 10 second residual flame time criterion,.3(b)\n(3), reject the Unit. If three or less of the individual specimens, from the 15\nselected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length,.3(b) (2) and/or\nthe 10 second residual flame time criteria,.3(b) (3), accept the Unit. If the garment under test does not have a 10-inch seam in the\nlargest size in which it is produced, the following selection and testing\nprocedure shall be followed. Select and cut specimens 8.9 cm. (3.5 in.) wide by the maximum\navailable seam length, with the seam in the center of the specimen and\nextending the entire specimen length. Cut three Samples (15 specimens). These\nspecimens shall be placed in specimen holders so that the bottom edge is even\nwith the bottom of the specimen holder and the seam begins in the center of the\nbottom edge. Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three\n\nSamples. All specimens cut from a single garment must be included in the same\n\nSample. Test the three Samples. If all three Samples pass the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion,.3(b) (1), and if three or less\nindividual specimens fail by charring the entire specimen length and/or\nexceeding the 10 second residual flame time criterion,.3(b) (3), accept the\n\nUnit. If the Unit is not accepted in the above test, three Samples (15\nspecimens) of the longest seam type shall be made using fabric and thread from\nproduction inventory and sewn on production machines by production operators. The individual fabric sections prior to sewing must be no larger than 20.3\n× 63.3 cm. (8 in. × 25 in.) and must be selected from more than one\narea of the base fabric. Test the three prepared Samples. Accept or reject the\n\nUnit as described previously in this subsection. Disposition of Rejected Units. Rejected Units\nshall not be retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as\ndefined in.1(a) except after reworking to improve the flammability\ncharacteristics and subsequent retesting in accordance with the procedures set\nforth in garment production testing. Records. Records of all Unit sizes, test\nresults, and the disposition of rejected Units must be maintained by the\nmanufacturer upon the effective date of this standard. Rules and regulations\nmay be established by the Federal Trade Commission. (4)\n\nCompliance Market Sampling Plan by FTC. The FTC may submit, for approval by the Secretary of Commerce, fabric and/or\ngarment sampling plans for use in market testing of items covered by this\nstandard. For approval, such plans shall define noncompliance of a production\n\nUnit to exist only when it is shown, with a high level of statistical\nconfidence, those production Units represented by tested items which fail such\nFTC plans will, in fact, fail this standard. Production Units found to be noncomplying under these\nprovisions shall be deemed not to conform to this standard. (c) Mounting and Conditioning of Specimens. The specimens shall be placed in specimen holders so that the bottom edge of\neach specimen is even with the bottom of the specimen holder. Mount the\nspecimen in as close to a flat configuration as possible. The sides of the\nspecimen holder shall cover 1.9 cm. (3/4 in.) of the specimen width along each\nlong edge of the specimen, and thus shall expose 5.1 cm. (2 in.) of the\nspecimen width. The sides of the specimen holder shall be clamped with a\nsufficient number of clamps or shall be taped to prevent the specimen from\nbeing displaced during handling and testing. The specimens may be taped in the\nholders if the clamps fail to hold them. Place the mounted specimens in the\ndrying oven in a manner that will permit free circulation of air at 105° C. (221° F.) around them for 30 minutes. 3\n\nRemove the mounted specimens from the oven and place them in\nthe desiccator for 30 minutes to cool. No more than five specimens shall be\nplaced in a desiccator at one time. Specimens shall remain in the desiccator no\nmore than 60 minutes. (d) Testing\n-(1)\n\nBurner\n\nAdjustment. With the hood fan turned off, use the needle valve to\nadjust the flame height of the burner to 3.8 cm. (1 1/2 in.) above the highest\npoint of the barrel of the burner. A suitable height indicator is shown in\n\nEngineering Drawing No. 6 and Figure 1. (2)\n\nSpecimen Burning and Evaluation. One at a\ntime, the mounted specimens shall be removed from the desiccator and suspended\nin the cabinet for testing. The cabinet door shall be closed and the burner\nflame impinged on the bottom edge of the specimen for 3.0±0.2\nseconds. 4\n\nFlame impingement is accomplished by\nmoving the burner under the specimen for this length of time, and then removing\nit. If flaming drips or fragments are evident, measure the residual\nflame time to the nearest 0.1 second. When afterglow has ceased, remove the specimen from the cabinet\nand holder, and place it on a clean flat surface. Fold the specimen lengthwise\nalong a line through the highest peak of the charred or melted area; crease the\nspecimen firmly by hand. Unfold the specimen and insert the hook with the\ncorrect weight as shown in Table 1 in the specimen on one side of the charred\narea 6.4 mm. (1/4 in.) from the lower edge. Tear the specimen by grasping the other lower corner of the\nfabric and gently raising the specimen and weight clear of the supporting\nsurface. 5\n\nMeasure the char length as the distance\nfrom the end of the tear to the edge of the specimen exposed to the flame. After testing each specimen, vent the hood and cabinet to remove the smoke\nand/or toxic gases. (3)\n\nReport. Report the value of char length, in centimeters (inches), and the residual flame time, in seconds, for each\nspecimen, as well as the average char length for each set of five\nspecimens. (4)\n\nLaundering. The procedures described under.4(b),.4(c), and.4(d) shall be carried out on finished items (as produced or\nafter one washing and drying) and after they have been washed and dried 50\ntimes according to AATCC Test Method 124-1969. 6\n\nItems which do not withstand 50 launderings shall be tested at the end of their\nuseful service life. Washing procedure 6.2(III), with a water temperature of\n60°±2.3° C. (140±5° F.), and drying procedure\n6.3.2(B), shall be used. Maximum load shall be 3.64 Kg. (8 pounds) and may\nconsist of any combination of test samples and dummy pieces. Alternatively, a\ndifferent number of times under another washing and drying procedure may be\nspecified and used, if that procedure has previously been found to be\nequivalent by the Federal Trade Commission. Such laundering is not required of items which are not intended\nto be laundered, as determined by the Federal Trade Commission. Items which are not susceptible to being laundered and are\nlabeled \"dryclean only\" shall be drycleaned by a procedure which has previously\nbeen found to be acceptable by the Federal Trade Commission. For the purpose of the issuance of a guarantee under section 8\nof the Act, finished sleepwear garments to be tested according to.4(b) need\nnot be laundered or drycleaned provided all fabrics used in making the garments\n(except trim have been guaranteed by the fabric producer to be acceptable when\ntested according to.4(b)..5\n\nLabeling Requirements-\n(a) Care\n\nLabels. All items of children's sleepwear shall be labeled with\nprecautionary instructions to protect the items from agents or treatments which\nare known to cause deterioration of their flame resistance. If the item has\nbeen initially tested under.4(d) (4) after one washing and drying, It shall be\nlabeled with instructions to wash before wearing. Such labels shall be\npermanent and otherwise in accordance with rules and regulations established by\nthe Federal Trade Commission. (b) Temporary Requirement for Noncomplying\n\nItems. Items of noncomplying children's sleepwear which are\nmanufactured during the 12 months following the effective date of the standard\nshall, prior to introduction into commerce, be prominently, permanently, and\nconspicuously labeled with the following statement: \"Flammable (Does Not Meet\nU.S. Department of Commerce Standard DOC FF 3-71.) Should not be worn near\nsources of fire.\" Such labels should be in accordance with the rules and\nregulations established by the Federal Trade Commission.

(70±2°F.) and 65±2\npercent relative humidity. Shorter conditioning times may be used if the change\nin weight of a specimen in successive weighings made at intervals of not less\nthan 2 hours does not exceed 0.2 percent of the weight of the specimen. 1 Copies available from the National Technical information\n\nService, 5285 Port Royal Street, Springfield, VA 22151. 2 Option 1 of ASTM, D2654-67T, \"Method of Test for Amount of\n\nMoisture In Textile Materials,\" describes a satisfactory oven (1970 Book of\nASTM Standards, Part 24, published by the American Society for Testing and\n\nMaterials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19103). 3 If the specimens are moist when received, permit them to air\ndry at laboratory conditions prior to placement in the oven. A satisfactory\npreconditioning procedure may be found in ASTM D 1776--67, \"Conditioning\n\nTextiles and Textile Products for Testing.\" (\"1970 Book or ASTM Standards,\"\nPart 24, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race\n\nStreet, Philadelphia, PA 19103.)\n4 If more than 15 seconds elapse between removal of a specimen\nfrom the desiccator and the initial flame impingement, that specimen shall be\nreconditioned prior to testing. 5 A figure showing how this is done is given in AATCC 34-1969, Technical Manual of the American Association or Textile Chemists and Colorists, vol. 46, 1970, published by AATCC, Post Office Box 12215, Research Triangle\n\nPark, N.C. 27709. 6 Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile\n\nChemists and Colorists, vol. 46, 1970, published by AATCC, Post Office Box\n12215, Research Triangle Park, N.C. 27709.
