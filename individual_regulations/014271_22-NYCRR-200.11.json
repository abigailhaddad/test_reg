  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 200.11 - Assignment of criminal actions\n\nState Regulations\n\nCriminal actions shall be assigned as\nfollows: (a) General. Except as the Chief Administrator of the Courts may otherwise provide, all\ncriminal actions in Supreme Court and in County Court shall be heard and\ndisposed of in accordance with an individual assignment system. (b) Arraignment-conference part. The Chief Administrator of the Courts may authorize the establishment of an\narraignment-conference part for any superior court. Where an\narraignment-conference part has been established, upon commencement of a\ncriminal action in the superior court, the action shall be assigned to such\npart. The judge presiding therein shall arraign the defendant and hear and\ndetermine any bail application. If no plea of guilty is entered within 14\ncalendar days of the defendant's arraignment, or if the judge presiding\ndetermines that it is unlikely that a plea of guilty will be entered, the\naction shall be assigned to a judge as provided in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. If a plea of guilty is entered within such time period, the action\nshall remain in the arraignment-conference part for sentencing and any further\nproceedings therein. (c) Assignment of actions to individual\nassignment judges. Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, upon\ncommencement of a criminal action in the superior court, the action shall be\nassigned to a judge by the clerk of the court in which it is pending pursuant\nto a method of random selection authorized by the Chief Administrator. The\njudge thereby assigned shall be known as the \"assigned judge\" with respect to\nsuch action and, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d) of this\nsection, shall conduct all further proceedings therein. (d) Exceptions. (1)\n\nWhere the requirements of\nmatters already assigned to a judge are such as to limit the ability of that\njudge to handle additional cases, the Chief Administrator may authorize that\nnew assignments to that judge be suspended until the judge is able to handle\nadditional cases. (2)\n\nThe Chief Administrator may authorize the assignment of one or more special\nreserve trial judges. Such judges may be assigned matters for trial in\nexceptional circumstances where the needs of the courts require such\nassignment. (3)\n\nMatters requiring immediate disposition may be assigned to a judge designated\nto hear such matters when the assigned judge is not available. (4)\n\nThe Chief Administrator may\nauthorize the transfer of any action and any matter relating to an action from\none judge to another in accordance with the needs of the court. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
