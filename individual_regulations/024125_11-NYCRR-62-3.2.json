  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 62-3.2 - Standard claim form; filing requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Standard claim form. Claim form NYFC-1 (Part 1 and Part 2), in this section, shall be the Standard Fire Claim Form to be used as of the effective date of this Subpart, but insurers may continue to use existing stocks of other claim forms for 180 days following the effective date of this Subpart. Thereafter, no insurer may require or permit any claimant to complete a form differing from the Standard Fire Claim Form prescribed herein, other than additional requests for information pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section. (b) Filing requirements. All insurers are required to maintain in their files, before a claim may be paid, the information contained in Part 1 of form NYFC-1 for every fire claim made on a policy. In addition, for all claims which in the estimate of the insurer shall exceed $10,000, Part 2 of form NYFC-1 must also be completed and maintained in the insurer's files. The insurer may require the completion of Part 2 of form NYFC-1 for claims of less than $10,000 if it has good and sufficient reason for doing so; provided, however, that such practice does not constitute an unfair claim settlement practice. (c) Policy provisions. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to waive any requirements and obligations set forth in the insurance policy, e.g., the filing of a proof of loss and submission to a statement under oath. (d) Additional information. Nothing contained herein shall preclude an insurer from obtaining additional information from the claimant or any other source. (e) Standard fire claim form (Part 1).
