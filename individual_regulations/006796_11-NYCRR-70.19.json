(2)\n\nFor a first excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage, and purchased by a hospital in accordance with section 18 of chapter 184 of the Laws of 1998 as amended by chapter 161 of the Laws of 1997, the rate shall be 17.6 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established for the Medical Malpractice Insurance Association in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section. (3)\n\nFor a second excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above the underlying primary coverage and the first layer of excess coverage described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, the rate shall be 9.8 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established for the Medical Malpractice Insurance Association in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section. (e) Claims-made primary and excess coverage rates. (1)\n\nClaims-made coverage rate. The rate for a claims-made policy shall be the corresponding occurrence rate multiplies by the appropriate claims-made factor, as follows: Year in claims-made program\n\nClaims-made factor\n\nFirst\n31%\nSecond\n64\n\nThird\n85\n\nFourth\n94\n\nFifth\n99\n\nSixth\n102\n\nSeventh\n104\n\nEighth and Later\n105\n(2)\n\nOptional extended reporting period (tail) rates: (i) The rate for optional tail coverage required to be offered for a claims-made policy shall be the corresponding occurrence rate multiplied by the appropriate tail factor, as follows: Number of years completed in claims-made program\n\nTail factor\n\nOne\n74.8%\nTwo\n122.1\n\nThree\n146.4\n\nFour\n162.4\n\nFive\n173.3\n\nSix\n181.0\n\nSeven\n186.7\n\nEight or more\n190.6\n(ii)\n\nFor a policy terminated on a date other than its anniversary date, the tail factor shall be obtained by interpolation, on a daily basis, between the tail factors applicable to the preceding and following policy anniversaries. (iii)\n\nFor any policy written at a reduced rate because the insured was eligible for a new-doctor discount, the tail premium shall be reduced by the percentage that the current year's rate (exclusive of any surplus contributions) was reduced as a result of such new-doctor discount. (f) Rates for claims-made policies where the physician, while receiving coverage under a claims-made policy, changes classification or territory. (1)\n\nWhen a physician insured under a claims-made policy changes either classification, territory or both, the rate applicable to such physician shall be adjusted to reflect the fact that claims made under the policy after the change could include claims for occurrences which took place under the former classification or territory. The presence of a loading for pre-paid extended reporting period coverage in the rate structure complicates that would otherwise be a relatively simple calculation, in that the amount of such loading applicable to the difference in rates before and after the change must be considered. Accordingly, all insurers should use the procedure established by section\n70.14\n(f)(2)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nAll insurers providing claims-made coverage subject to this Part shall: (i) amend their policy applications to require the applicant to identify every insurer which previously provided coverage on a claims-made basis and to indicate if and how any classification or territory has been modified since first entry into the claims-made program; (ii)\nconfirm the classification or territory information with the previous insurer or insurers; and\n(iii)\nfurnish, upon the written request of an insurer, or former or current insured, classification or territory information relative to such insured or former insured. (3)\n\nFor the purposes of this subdivision, the term\nclassification\nshall include changes from full-time to part-time or part-time to full-time practice. (g) Excess coverage-types of policies. (1)\n\nPursuant to chapters 161 and 261 of the Laws of 1997, excess coverage policies providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million of primary coverage, purchased by general hospitals on behalf of physicians, shall cover occurrences from July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998. Accordingly, all physicians' and surgeons' medical malpractice liability insurers, and only such insurers, shall issue such an excess policy on an occurrence basis. (2)\n\nExcess coverage policies issued or renewed on and after July 1, 1997, shall provide coverage on either an occurrence or claims-made basis, subject to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, provided that: (i) An excess coverage policy shall be renewed on the same basis (occurrence or claims-made) as issued, except that the insured may choose to substitute claims-made for occurrence coverage. (ii)\n\nIf the insured so requests, an excess coverage policy issued by the same insurer that issued the underlying primary coverage shall be issued with the same type of coverage (occurrence or claims-made) as the primary coverage. (iii)\n\nThe provisions of section\n70.7\n(b)(2)\nof this Part continue to apply to all medical malpractice liability insurers. (h) Required filings. (1)\n\nNo later than October 1, 1997, all physicians' medical malpractice liability insurers shall file required amended rate manual pages with the superintendent in accordance with the rates established by this Part. Insurers writing, or required to write, coverage for which rates are not specifically established by this Part shall file proposed rates with supporting documentation by October 1, 1997. (2)\nA physicians' medical malpractice liability rate filed by a rate service organization on behalf of its members and subscribers shall be established in accordance with this Part and any such organization shall make appropriate filings by October 1, 1997. (3)\n\nThe rates and rating plans for medical malpractice liability insurance issued by an insurer to a Federal purchasing group and its members shall be established in accordance with the provisions of this Part, except that, if the insurer and purchasing group have complied with all applicable provisions of the Liability Risk Retention Act, 15 USC\n3901\net seq, (see section\n70.1\n[m]\nof this Part) and Part 301 of this Title, and if the insurer submits rates or a rating plan affording advantages, based upon the purchasing group's loss and expense experience, not afforded to other persons, the superintendent shall review such submission, and thereafter establish rates or a rating plan, as appropriate, reflecting such advantages. Any such insurer presently issuing such coverage shall file proposed rates with adequate documentation by October 1, 1997. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
