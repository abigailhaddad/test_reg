(2)\n\nNo human excreta shall be placed or spread upon the surface of the ground at any point on the watershed of the water supply. (3)\n\nNo human excreta shall be buried in the soil on the watershed of the water supply unless deposited in trenches or pits at a distance of not less than 500 feet from any reservoir or any tributary watercourse and covered with not less than 18 inches of soil in such a manner as to effectually prevent its being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow. (4)\n\nNo privy or receptacle of any kind for the storage or deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any reservoir or any tributary watercourse, unless such privy or receptacle shall contain or be a watertight receptacle, removable or otherwise, and no sewage shall be discharged or allowed to flow into any reservoir or any tributary watercourse nor upon the surface of the ground at any point on the watershed of the supply nor disposed beneath the surface of the ground within 100 feet thereof, except into a watertight receptacle, removable or otherwise, from which privy or receptacle no outward percolation can take place and which shall be emptied when filled up to within six inches of the top. If the contents of any such privy or receptacle shall be disposed of on the watershed, such contents shall be buried as set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. All such privies and receptacles referred to in this paragraph shall be placed as far as possible (within said limiting distance) from any such reservoir or tributary watercourse, as the property to which such privy or receptacle is appurtenant shall permit, and shall be constructed or installed only with the approval and under the supervision of the New Rochelle Water Company and in such manner as effectually to prevent any pollution of the water supply. These restrictions and limiting distances shall not apply to sewage treatment plants installed under and in accordance with plans which first have been submitted to and approved by the State or Westchester County Commissioner of Health.

(2)\n\nNo garbage, refuse, putrescible matter, decayed fruits or vegetables, dead animals or parts thereof, oil wastes or any other matter that pollutes water shall be deposited in any reservoir or tributary watercourse nor on or beneath the surface of the ground within 100 feet of any reservoir or any tributary watercourse nor in such manner that it can be washed by rain, melting snow or otherwise over the surface or through the ground into any reservoir or tributary watercourse.

(3)\n\nNo animal or poultry shall be allowed to stand, wade, wallow or swim nor to be washed or watered in any reservoir or any tributary watercourse and no watering place shall be maintained in such way as to pollute any reservoir or tributary watercourse with excremental matter. (4)\n\nNo stable for cattle or horses, barnyard, hogyard, pigpen, poultry house or yard, hitching place or standing place for horses or other animals shall be so located or maintained in such a manner that the drainage, leachings or washings therefrom may pollute any reservoir or any tributary watercourse. (5)\n\nNo manure pile shall be maintained or allowed to remain within 150 feet of any reservoir or any tributary watercourse. (f) [Camps.] No camp, tent, building or other structure for the occupancy of laborers engaged in construction work or for other use, except as a private camp or dwelling maintained by a person for his own personal use or for use of family and friends, shall be located, placed or maintained within a distance of 300 feet of any reservoir or any tributary watercourse. (g) [Cemeteries.] No interment of a human body shall be made within a distance of 200 feet of any reservoir or any tributary watercourse. (h) [General clause.] In addition to observing the foregoing requirements, all persons living on or visiting the watershed shall refrain from any act, though not heretofore specified, which may result in contamination of any portion of the water supply. (i) [Inspections.] The New Rochelle Water Company or such other person or persons as may be charged with the maintenance or supervision of the water supply or the duly appointed representative of said company shall make regular and thorough inspections of all reservoirs, watercourses and watersheds tributary thereto for the purpose of ascertaining whether the above rules and regulations are being complied with, and it shall be the duty of said water company to cause copies of any rules and regulations violated to be served upon the persons violating the same, together with notices of such violations. If such persons served do not immediately comply with the rules and regulations, it shall be the further duty of said water company to promptly notify the State and Westchester County commissioners of health of such violations. The water company shall report to the State Commissioner of Health in writing annually, on the first day of January, the results of the regular inspections made during the preceding year, stating the number of inspections which have been made, the number of violations found, the number of notices served and the general condition of the watershed at the time of the last inspection.

In accordance with section 70 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law), as amended by chapter 391 of the Laws of 1933, the penalty for each and every violation of or noncompliance with any of these rules and regulations which relate to a permanent source or act of contamination is hereby fixed at $100.
