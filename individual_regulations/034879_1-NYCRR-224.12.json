  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 224.12 - Color coding of fill ports\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe owner or operator of a retail establishment selling\npetroleum products from underground storage tanks (USTs) shall permanently mark\nall fill ports to identify the products inside. These markings shall be in\naccordance with the color code set forth in American Petroleum Industries (API)\n\nRecommended Practice (RP) 1637, 4th edition, April 2020, published by the API, 1220 L Street, Washington DC 20005-4070. The Department of Environmental\n\nConservation (DEC) previously incorporated by reference API RP 1637 in its\nregulations regulating petroleum bulk storage (6 NYCRR\n613-1.10\n). API RS 1637\nwas filed with the Department of State on May 23, 2023, file number M-20-15. Copies are available for inspection during regular business hours at the office\nof the DEC Division of Environmental Remediation, located at 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233, at the Department of Agriculture and Markets, 10B Airline\n\nDrive, Albany, New York 12235, and at the Department of State, 99Washington\n\nAvenue, Suite 650, Albany, New York 12231. If a UST system contains petroleum\nthat does not have a corresponding API color code, the owner or operator of the\nretail establishment must clearly and conspicuously mark the fill port to\nidentify the petroleum that is in the UST system. For any fill port connected\nto multiple UST systems storing different types of petroleum, the owner or\noperator of the retail establishment may place the marking referred to herein\nnear the fill port to identify the petroleum in the UST systems.
