  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 375-6.9 - Development or modification of soil cleanup objectives\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. This section identifies\nwhen and the procedures under which a contaminant-specific soil cleanup\nobjective may be developed or modified. (1)\n\nSoil cleanup objectives for contaminants not included in Tables 375-6.8(a) and\n(b) of this Subpart may be developed by the remedial party or required by the\ndepartment. (2)\n\nSoil cleanup\nobjectives for contaminants included in Tables 375-6.8(a) and (b) of this\n\nSubpart, may be modified based on site-specific data if desired by the remedial\nparty; as set forth in: (i) Subpart 375-3 for\n\nTracks 3 or 4, as set forth in section\n375-3.8\n(e)(3) or\n(4), respectively of this Part; or\n(ii)\n\nSubparts 375-2 and 375-4 of this Part, as set forth in section 375- 2.8(b)(1)(iii) and 375-4.8(c)(1)(iii) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nProtection of\necological resources soil cleanup objectives were not developed for certain\ncontaminants, which are identified in Table 375-6.8(b) of this Subpart as \"NS\". Where such contaminants: (i) appear in Table\n375-6.8(a), the applicant may be required by the department to calculate a\nprotection of ecological resources soil cleanup objective for the contaminant\nfor use in Track 1 and apply such soil cleanup objective where it is lower than\nthe soil cleanup objective set forth in Table 375-6.8(a) of this Subpart; or\n(ii)\nare identified as impacting\nor threatening an ecological resource for a restricted use remedial program the\ndepartment may require a protection of ecological resources soil cleanup\nobjective be developed. (b) New soil cleanup objectives must: (1)\n\nBe developed utilizing the same\nmethodologies that were used by the department to develop the respective soil\ncleanup objective, as provided in the technical support document. (2)\n\nApply the following caps, as set forth in\nsection 9.3 of the technical support document, on any soil cleanup objective\nincluded in Tables 375-6.8(a) and (b) of this Part, with the exception of\nmetals, as set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, developed for: (i) unrestricted use, residential use, restricted-residential use and the protection of ecological resources, a\nmaximum value of 100 ppm; (ii)\ncommercial use, a maximum value of 500 ppm; and\n(iii)\nindustrial use and the protection of\ngroundwater a maximum value of 1000 ppm, and\n(3)\n\nApply a cap for metals at a maximum value\nof 10,000 ppm. (c) Development of unrestricted use soil cleanup objectives. Development of\nunrestricted use soil cleanup objectives. The unrestricted use soil cleanup\nobjective for a compound will be the lowest of the soil cleanup values, calculated as set forth in appendix E of the technical support document, for\nthe protection of groundwater, protection of ecological resources and\nprotection of public health. (d) Development of restricted use soil cleanup objectives. The protection of: (1)\n\nGroundwater soil cleanup objective will\nbe the values calculated for the protection of groundwater as set forth in\nappendix E of the technical support document; (2)\n\nEcological resources soil cleanup\nobjectives will be the values calculated for the protection of ecological\nresources as set forth in appendix E of the technical support document; and\n(3)\n\nPublic health cleanup\nobjective will be the values calculated for the protection of public health for\nthe identified use of the site, as set forth in appendix E of the technical\nsupport document. (e) Modification of soil cleanup objectives. The contaminant-specific soil cleanup\nobjectives set forth at Table 675-6.8(a) and (b) of this Subpart may be\nmodified by site specific data as set forth in this subdivision. (1)\n\nContaminant-specific soil cleanup\nobjectives modified in accordance with this subdivision may be utilized by the\nremedial party for a site remedial program undertaken pursuant to: (i) Subpart 375-3 in Tracks 3 or 4, as set\nforth in section\n375-3.8\n(e)(3) or\n(4), respectively of this Part; or\n(ii)\n\nSubparts 375-2 and 375-4, as set forth\nin sections\n375-2.8\n(b)(1)(ii)\nand\n375-4.8\n(c)(1)(ii)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nFor\nthe calculation of a protection of groundwater or ecological resources\ncontaminant-specific soil cleanup objective, the site-specific percentage of\ntotal organic carbon in the soil at the site may be substituted in the\nalgorithms provided in appendix E of the technical support document. (3)\n\nFor the calculation of a protection of\npublic health contaminant-specific soil cleanup objective, site-specific data\nmay be used to modify two of the five exposure pathways, as follows: (i) for the particulate inhalation pathway\nsix parameters rely on site-specific data; and\n(ii)\nfor the volatile inhalation pathway, four parameters rely on site-specific data. (4)\n\nThe algorithms to be used for each\nprotection of public health pathway and details on the parameters which can be\nsubstituted are included in appendix E of the technical support\ndocument. (f) Use of\nsoil cleanup objectives developed or modified. Once approved by the department, contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives developed or modified as set forth\nin this section may be utilized by the department at other sites consistent\nwith paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nContaminant-specific soil cleanup\nobjectives developed for contaminants not included in Table 375-6.8(a) and (b), as set forth in subdivision (b) of this section, will be used as guidance and\nshall be considered by the department for inclusion in the Tables in this\n\nSubpart during any subsequent reevaluation of the soil cleanup objectives, as\nset forth by ECL 27-1415. (2)\n\nContaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives modified for site-specific\nparameters, as set forth in subdivision (f) of this section, may be utilized at\nsites manifesting similar parameters, if approved by the department.
