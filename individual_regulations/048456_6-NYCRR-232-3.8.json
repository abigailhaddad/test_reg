  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 232-3.8 - Approved alternative solvents\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Approval Criteria. One hundred and eighty (180) days after the effective date\nof this Subpart, any alternative solvent used in any dry cleaning machine in\n\nNew York State must be an approved alternative solvent. Approval shall be\ngranted by the department if sufficient information, as described under\nsubdivision (c), is provided by the solvent manufacturer to demonstrate that\nthe solvent meets the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe solvent has a flash point at or above 140° F; (2)\n\nThe solvent toxicity can be classified as\nmeeting the criteria for a Low or Moderate Toxicity Air Contaminant as defined\nunder Part 212 of this Title; and\n(3)\n\nThe composition of the manufactured\nsolvent has an acceptable batch-to-batch consistency as demonstrated in the\nlaboratory analyses of five (5) independent batch samples. (b) Listing Publication. The list of approved\nalternative solvents shall be published in the Environmental Notice Bulletin\nand on the department's web site. Proposed changes to this list shall be\nnoticed in the bulletin with a thirty (30) day comment period. Unless\nsignificant adverse comments are received by the department, the proposed\nchanges shall then become effective upon publication on the department's web\nsite. (c) Approval Process. Any\nmanufacturer of an alternative solvent must submit the following information to\nthe department to request approval of the solvent for use in any dry cleaning\nequipment used in New York State. After approval, should the chemical\nformulation of the solvent be modified, the re-formulated alternative solvent\nmust be resubmitted and approved by the department prior to use in New York\n\nState. The department will issue all proposed determinations of approval within\n90 days of receipt of a complete submission. (1)\n\nThe Chemical Abstract Service (CAS)\nnumber(s) of the alternative solvent and any applicable individual chemical\nspecies that may comprise the solvent mixture. For a solvent mixture, the\npercent contribution of each individual chemical specie, that equals or exceeds\n0.1 percent by weight (1000 ppm) of the alternative solvent, must be identified\nand quantified. (2)\n\nThe flash point\nand other physical and chemical properties of the solvent and of all of its\ncomponents. (3)\nA characterization\nof the batch to batch uniformity of the solvent's chemical composition\nincluding any Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) related product\nstandards and procedures used by the manufacturer to assure its uniformity. At\nleast five laboratory analysis reports must be submitted that quantify the\nalternative solvent's full chemical composition and demonstrate that each batch\nsample meets the approval criteria specified in Subdivision (a). (4)\n\nThe results of toxicity tests (e.g., acute, subchronic, genotoxicity, etc.) in animals or cell cultures that have\nbeen conducted with the product or components as required by federal\nlaw. (5)\n\nAny information on\nenvironmental fate (e.g., an atmospheric half life, degradation in water, etc.). (6)\n\nAny toxicity and/or\nexposure information submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) under the Toxics Substance Control Act (TSCA) concerning this product or\nits components. (d) Solvent conformity test. After an alternative solvent has been approved for use\nin New York State, the department may periodically require that the\nmanufacturer retest the solvent to verify that the chemical composition of the\napproved alternative solvent has not changed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n232-3.8\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register February 28, 2018/Volume XL, Issue 09, eff. 3/9/2018\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
