  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 838.2 - Partial disclosure of records\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf a record contains both disclosable and non-disclosable\ninformation, the nondisclosable information will be deleted and the remaining\nrecord will be disclosed unless the two are so inextricably intertwined that it\nis not feasible to separate them or release of the disclosable information\nwould compromise or impinge upon the nondisclosable portion of the\nrecord. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n838.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
