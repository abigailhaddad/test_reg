Tit. 9 § 7820.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purposes of this Subchapter, the terms\nhereinafter listed shall have the following meanings: (a) Ballast\nmeans a device\nused with an electric-discharge lamp to obtain the necessary circuit conditions\n(voltage, current and wave form) for starting and operating. (b) Building lighting load\nmeans the total amount of power used for lighting, measured in watts, from all\npermanently mounted lighting fixtures in an existing building, other than\nspecialized lighting fixtures. Building lighting load includes the ballast loss\nfor fluorescent and mercury vapor fixtures. (c) Building lighting power\nbudget\nmeans the total amount of power, measured in watts, which may\nbe used for lighting in an existing building, as calculated in accordance with\nsection\n7822.2\nof this\n\nSubchapter. (d) Comprehensive lighting energy conservation analysis\nmeans an\nanalysis for an existing building conducted prior to September 1, 1980, which\nincluded: (1)\nan identification of the total\namount of power used for lighting; (2)\na determination of potential reductions\nin lighting power; and\n(3)\nspecific\nrecommendations for this reduction of lighting power. (e) Cost effective\nmeans\nhaving a cost of implementation which does not exceed the present value of\nenergy and maintenance savings expected over a seven-year period. (f) Directly metered portion of an\nexisting building\nmeans each part of an existing building which\nreceives electric service directly from a utility, in exchange for payments to\nthe utility proportional to the individually metered consumption for such\npart. (g) Existing\nbuilding\nmeans any building or directly metered portion thereof, other\nthan a residence or apartment building, whose operation requires on the average\nin excess of 5,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month for lighting\npurposes in any 12-month period and which was in existence, or under\nconstruction, or for which an application for a building permit was made and\nplans filed, in this State prior to January 1, 1979. (h) Fixture\nmeans a complete\nlighting unit consisting of a lamp, or lamps, together with the parts designed\nto distribute the light, to position and protect the lamps, and to connect the\nlamps to the power supply. (i) Fluorescent lamp\nmeans a low pressure electric-discharge lamp\nin which a fluorescing coating (phosphor) transforms some of the ultraviolet\nenergy generated by the discharge into light. (j) Incandescent lamp\nmeans\na lamp in which light is produced by a filament heated to incandescence by an\nelectric current. (k) Inside gross area\nmeans the interior floor area of an existing\nbuilding, expressed in square feet, measured between the inside surfaces of\nexterior (or common) walls. Inside gross area includes the space taken by\ninterior walls. (l) Lamp\nmeans a generic term for a man-made source of light often\ncalled a \"bulb\" or \"tube\". (m) Mercury vapor lamp\nmeans a lamp in which light is produced by\nthe passage of an electric current through an ionized mercury gas\n(vapor). (n) Municipality\nmeans any county, city, town, village, school\ndistrict, district corporation, public authority, or the Port Authority of New\n\nYork and New Jersey to the extent its facilities are located within the State\nof New York. (o) Space\nmeans a room or other interior area in an existing\nbuilding. (p) Specialized\nlighting fixture\nmeans an air-handling lighting fixture that is\nspecifically designed for use as a plenum integral to the heating and\nventilating system, and any fixture when used for highlighting applications\nsuch as merchandise spotlighting, show-window lighting, sculpture exhibits, art\nexhibits and television studios. (q) Standards\nmeans the\n\nState lighting efficiency standards prescribed by this Subchapter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n7820.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
