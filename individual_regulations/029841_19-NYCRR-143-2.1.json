  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 §§ 143-2.1 - Names of debtors who are individuals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Individual name fields. The names of\nindividuals are stored in files that include only the names of individuals, and\nnot the names of organizations. Separate data entry fields are established for\nfirst (given), middle (given), and last names (surnames or family names) of\nindividuals, and for any suffix. A filer should place the name of an individual\ndebtor with a single name (e.g., Cher) in the field designated for the last\nname. The filing officer assumes no responsibility for the accurate designation\nof the components of a name but will enter the data in accordance with the\nfiler's designations. (b) Titles\nand prefixes before names. Titles and prefixes, such as \"Doctor,\" \"Reverend,\"\n\"Mr.,\" and \"Ms.,\" should not be provided by filers in UCC documents. However, when a UCC document is submitted with designated name fields, the data will be\nentered in the UCC information management system exactly as it\nappears. (c) Titles and suffixes\nafter names. Titles or indications of status such as \"M.D.\" and \"Esquire\" are\nnot part of an individual's name and should not be provided by filers in UCC\ndocuments. Suffixes that indicate which individual is being named, such as\n\"Senior,\" \"Junior,\" \"I,\" \"II,\" and \"III,\" are appropriate. In either case, they\nwill be entered into the information management system exactly as\nreceived. (d) Truncation -\nindividual names. Personal name fields in the UCC database are fixed in length. Although filers should continue to provide full names on their UCC documents, a\nname that exceeds the fixed length is entered as presented to the filing\nofficer, up to the maximum length of the data entry field. The lengths of data\nentry fields in the central filing office are as follows: first name: 60 characters\nmiddle name: 30 characters\nlast name: 100 characters\nsuffix: 10 characters\n(e) The central filing office may from time\nto time specify the maximum number of characters that may be contained in the\nfields of a UCC document transmitted to the central filing office by XML\ntransmission or by any other electronic delivery method. The numbers so\nspecified by the central filing office for the first name field, middle name\nfield, last name field and suffix field of an individual may be less than, equal to or greater than the respective numbers specified in subdivision (d) of\nthis section.
