Information necessary to demonstrate compliance shall be submitted at the request of the municipal water purveyor. The aforesaid shall cause copies of any provisions violated to be served on the person violating same together with notices of such violations. If said person does not immediately comply, the municipal water purveyor shall promptly notify the board and the State Commissioner of Health of such violations. The board shall make annual reports to the State Commissioner of Health, before January 30th, including such information on number of inspections, violations found, notices served, violations abated, the general condition of the resource and any other information relevant to the enforcement and administration of this Part. (i) Variances. (1)\n\nStandards. An owner who experiences practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship because of the literal interpretation of the provisions of this Part may request a hearing by the Commissioner of Health. The commissioner may grant a variance from the requirements of this Part if the commissioner finds that the health, welfare and safety of the consuming public will be protected. In making this determination, the commissioner shall consider the following factors and make findings regarding each: (i) whether the use or activity to be authorized by the waiver or variance is in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Part; (ii)\nwhether a substantial change will be produced in the general condition of the resource or a substantial risk to groundwater quality or quantity will be created because of the variance; (iii)\nwhether the hardship or difficulty can be alleviated by some other method that is feasible for the applicant to pursue; (iv)\nwhether the variance requested is the minimum variance necessary to afford relief. To this end, the Health Department may grant a lesser variance than that applied for; or\n(v) whether the hardship or difficulty has not been created by the applicant. (2)\n\nDecision of the commissioner. The commissioner may request the local water purveyor and the board to review any application for a variance before reaching a determination regarding the request. The commissioner may impose such conditions as it may deem necessary to serve the purpose and intent of this Part. The commissioner shall act on all requests within 60 days of a variance application. Failure to act within this 60-day period shall be deemed a denial of the application. Every decision of the Health Department to grant, grant with conditions or deny a variance request shall be made in writing and served on the applicant and shall include all findings made regarding the aforementioned factors. All conditions shall be expressly set forth and the reasons for such conditions specified. Violations of the conditions of a variance shall be a violation of this Part. The issuance of a variance shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the construction of any structure but shall merely authorize the filing of an application for any permit or approval that may be required by the municipality which such action is proposed. (3)\n\nVariance application procedure. Applications for a variance shall be submitted to the appropriate municipal water purveyor by registered mail and shall contain at least the following information: (i) the applicant's name, address and his interest in the subject property; or the owner's name and address, if different from the applicant, and the owner's signed consent to file the application; (ii)\nthe protection zone location, along with the street address and legal description of the subject property; (iii)\na narrative description of the proposed use or action together with any other pertinent information that may be necessary to adequately review the application; (iv)\na sketch plan illustrating all proposed site alterations, all structures existing onsite, the existing uses and zoning of adjacent parcels, site contours and drainage patterns; (v) a statement articulating the hardship or difficulty imposed by the enforcement and administration of this Part with specific reference to the factors listed in this Part; (vi)\na statement assessing the potential impact on groundwater quality of the use or activity to be authorized by the waiver or variance; and\n(vii)\na plan and annual report as described in subparagraphs (c)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section where applicable. (j) Penalties for violations. Any person, firm or corporation who violates, disobeys, refuses to comply with or resists the enforcement of this Part shall be subject to those penalties specified in section\n1103\nof the Public Health Law. Any such violation may be enjoined subject to sections\n1102, 1104\nand\n1105\nof the Public Health Law. (k) Amendments. The board, from time to time, on its own motion or on a recommendation from any communities in Schenectady County served by the Schenectady Aquifer, as specified in subdivision (a) of this section, may propose to amend, supplement or change the provisions of this Part. In proposing any amendment, supplement or change, the board shall, in writing, state the reasons for such action. No amendment, supplement or change proposed by the board shall be considered for adoption as a valid part of this Part until it is duly approved by resolution of the governing bodies of each of the communities in Schenectady County served by the Schenectady Aquifer, as specified in subdivision (a) of this section, adopted by the State Commissioner of Health, and filed in the Office of the Secretary of State. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to impair the authority of the State Commissioner of Health to make rules and regulations for the protection from contamination of any or all public supplies of potable waters and water supplies of this State. (l) Separability. If any section, paragraph or part of this Part is for any reason declared invalid or held unconstitutional by any court of last resort, every other section, paragraph and part shall continue in full force and effect.
