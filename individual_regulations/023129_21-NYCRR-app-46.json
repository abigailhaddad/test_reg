  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 21, Appendices, app 46\n\nState Regulations\nAPPENDICES\nLists of actions. The purpose of these appendices is to\nsimplify the task of determining whether or not a proposed action is an exempt\naction or may have a significant effect on the environment by identifying\nactions or classes of actions that are likely to have a significant effect and\nthose which will not have a significant effect. Because of the complex and varied nature of actions, the lists\nin these appendices are not all inclusive. The omission from the lists of an\naction does not mean that it is exempt from these OCWA-EQ Regulations, nor does\nit mean that it is automatically an action requiring environmental impact\nstatement preparation. The criteria set forth in Section 6 NYCRR\n617.9\nand\ncriteria included in 6 NYCRR\n617.10\nand this Part shall be used to determine\nsignificance with respect to actions not listed in this section. The following\nclassification system as used in Appendices B and C. Type I Actions or classes of actions that are likely to require\npreparation of environmental impact statements because they will in almost\nevery instance have a significant effect on the environment. Type II Actions or classes of actions which have been\ndetermined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which do not\nrequire environmental impact statements or are exempt or ministerial\naction. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. tit. 21, Appendices, app\n46\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
