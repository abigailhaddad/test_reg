  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23 § 600.8 - Sales-based financing-historical method\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nsection shall apply only to sales-based financing utilizing the \"historical\nmethod\" as described in Financial Services Law section 803. (b) With respect to any assumptions about a\nrecipient's future monthly sales necessary to calculate the disclosures\nrequired by this Part, a provider shall use the \"estimated monthly sales\nprojection\" described below: (1)\nthe estimated\nmonthly sales projection shall be calculated as the recipient's historical\naverage of: (i) the monthly sales, income or\nreceipts volume received through the particular payment channel or mechanism; and\n(ii)\nthe monthly sales received\nthrough any other payment channel or mechanism that the financing contract\nwould have required recipients to redirect to the particular payment channel or\nmechanism had the financing contract been operative previously; (2)\nfor all transactions, or by\nrecipient industry or financing amount (or both), a provider shall fix the\nhistorical time period used to calculate the average historical sales, income, or receipts and use such period for all disclosure purposes for all sales-based\nfinancing products offered. The fixed historical time period shall either be\nthe preceding time period from the specific offer or, alternatively, the\nprovider may use average sales for the same number of months with the highest\nsales volume within the past twelve months. The fixed historical time period\nshall be no less than four months and no more than twelve months; (3)\nwhen a recipient has not been in\noperation for twelve months, the provider may calculate the recipient's\nhistorical average sales volume, income, or receipts using an average from the\nmonths the recipient has been in operation; (4)\na provider may exclude from the average\ncalculation required by subdivision (b)(1) of this section: (i) the monthly sales from any month that is\nless than the average monthly sales of the months required to be considered\nunder subdivisions (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section if the provider determines\nthat the decreased monthly sales in that month arose from a cause that is\nunlikely to recur (such as a natural disaster or uncommon business\ninterruption) during performance of the contract. A provider shall have no\nliability if it declines to make this optional exclusion; (ii)\nthe monthly sales from any month for\nwhich the recipient has failed to provide documentation of average monthly\nsales following the provider's request; and\n(iii)\nthe monthly sales from any number of\nmonths at the beginning of the period (starting with the oldest month) set by\nthe provider under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, if the provider does not\nrequire and receive monthly sales documentation from those months from the\nrecipient; (5)\nin\naddition to the months considered pursuant to paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, a provider may include in its average calculation all or none of\nthe additional months for which the recipient has provided sales documentation, excluding any months in which the recipient was not in operation; and\n(6)\nwhen a provider fixes the number of\nmonths it will consider pursuant to section\n600.8\n(b)(2)\nor\nsection\n600.8\n(b)(3)\nof\nthis Part, the provider shall record this decision in an internal document that\nincludes the effective date of the provider's decision. If the provider\nmodifies the months fixed pursuant to section\n600.8\n(b)(2)\nor\nsection\n600.8\n(b)(3)\nof\nthis Part, the provider shall create a new version of the document required by\nsection\n600.6\nof this Part. The provider\nshall maintain a copy of every version of the document while it is in effect\nand for a period of four years thereafter. (c) If a provider must make additional\nestimates or assumptions other than a recipient's estimated monthly sales\nprojection to provide disclosures required by this Part, the provider shall: (1)\nbase those estimates or assumptions on\nthe best information reasonably available to the provider at the time of the\ndisclosure; (2)\nstate clearly that\nany disclosure based upon an estimate or assumption is an \"estimate\" by adding\nthe word \"estimate\" to the descriptive language of any required disclosure\nunder this Part; and\n(3)\nstate\nclearly any assumptions or estimates used as the basis for the disclosure in\nany description associated with the disclosure.
