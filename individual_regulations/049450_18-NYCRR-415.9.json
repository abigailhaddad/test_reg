  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 415.9 - Rates\n\nState Regulations\nA social services district has the option to apply the\nweekly or daily rate, except as provided below, when care is provided for 30 or\nmore hours per week on five or less days. When care is provided for less than\n30 hours per week, the daily or part-day rates must be applied, as\napplicable. (a) Weekly rates must be\napplied when care is provided for 30 or more hours for five or less days per\nweek. Weekly rates also must be applied when child care services are provided\nfor 30 or more hours per week by a child care provider who routinely charges\nnonsubsidized parents on a weekly basis and who has not signed a purchase of\nservice contract or other written agreement for payment on a different\nbasis. (b) Daily rates must be\napplied if care is provided for at least six but less than twelve hours per\nday, and care is provided for less than 30 hours per week. When child care\nservices are provided for 30 or more hours per week by a child care provider\nwho routinely charges nonsubsidized parents on a daily basis and who has not\nsigned a purchase of service contract or other written agreement for payment on\na different basis, the weekly rates divided by five must be applied. (c) Part-day rates must be applied when the\nchild care services are provided for less than six hours per day. (d) Where child care services are provided by\nmultiple providers, reimbursement will be made for the actual cost of such\nservices up to the applicable rate for each child care provider used. However, if the combined reimbursement to the multiple providers would exceed one weekly\nmarket rate, in order to receive such reimbursement the parent or caretaker\nmust demonstrate that the schedule of employment of the parent or caretaker or\nthe special needs of the child necessitates that child care services be\narranged with multiple providers. If the social services district determines\nthat the parent or caretaker has not demonstrated that there is a necessity to\nuse multiple providers, reimbursement is limited to one weekly market rate that\nis applicable for the type of provider who provides care for the highest number\nof hours. The social services district will determine how to distribute the\nreimbursement for the multiple providers. (e) Differential payment rates for\nchild care services. (1)\nA social\nservices district may establish a differential payment rate for child care\nservices provided by licensed or registered child care providers that have been\naccredited by a nationally recognized child care organization. Legally-exempt\nchild care providers are not eligible for a differential payment rate under\nthis paragraph. If the social services district chooses to provide a\ndifferential rate, the differential rate must be at least five percent higher\nthan the actual cost of care or the applicable market rate, whichever is less. The differential rate may not exceed 15 percent of the actual cost of care or\nthe applicable market rate, whichever rate is less. (2)\nA social services district must establish\ndifferential payment rates for any eligible child care provider as defined in\nsection\n415.1\n(g) of this\n\nPart for child care services provided during nontraditional hours (evening, night or weekend hours). The differential rate must be at least five percent\nhigher than the actual cost of care or the applicable market rate, whichever is\nless. The differential rate may not exceed 15 percent of the actual cost of\ncare or the applicable market rate, whichever is less. (3)\nA social services district must establish\ndifferential payment rates for licensed and registered child care providers for\nchild care services provided to a child experiencing homelessness. A social\nservices district may establish differential payment rates for legally-exempt\nchild care providers for a child experiencing homelessness. The differential\nrate for licensed and registered child care providers must be at least five\npercent higher than the actual cost of care or the applicable market rate, whichever is less. There is no minimum differential rate for legally-exempt\nchild care providers. The differential rate may not exceed 15 percent of the\nactual cost of care or the applicable market rate, whichever is less. (4)\n\nThe differential payment rates the\ndistrict sets may be different for each category established in this\nsubdivision. The social services district must indicate in the district's\nconsolidated services plan or integrated county plan the percentage that it\nwill provide for each category. The social services district must indicate the\nrate that it will provide for child care providers that qualify for multiple\ndifferential payment rates, pursuant to this section. The total percentage must\nnot exceed 25 percent of the applicable market rate or the actual cost of care. A social services district may request a waiver from the office to establish a\npayment rate that is in excess of 25 percent above the applicable market rate\nupon a showing that the 25 percent maximum is insufficient to provide access\nwithin the district to such child care providers or services, as\napplicable. (f) Establishment of market rates. (1)\n\nThe Office will establish local market\nrates for child care services for each social services district set forth by\nthe type of provider the age of the child and the amount of time the child care\nservices are provided per week. (2)\n\nThere are two market rates for informal child care, a standard market rate and\nan enhanced market rate. The standard market rate for informal child care will\nbe 65 percent of the applicable registered family day care market rate. The\nenhanced market rate for informal child care will be 70 percent of the\napplicable registered family day care market rate. The enhanced market rate\nwill apply to those informal child care providers who have provided notice to, and have been verified by, the applicable enrollment agency as having completed\n10 or more hours of training annually in the areas set forth in section\n390-a\n(3)(b)\nof the Social Services Law. This 10 or\nmore hours of training must be in addition to the training requirements in\nsection\n415.13\nof this Part. A social\nservices district has the option, if it so chooses in the child care portion of\nits Child and Family Services Plan, to increase the enhanced market rate for\ninformal child care providers to up to 75 percent of the applicable registered\nfamily day care market rate. (3)\n\nThe social services district must use the most recent market rates established\nby the Office when calculating payments for child care services. The market\nrates are established by the Office at no less than the eightieth percentile of\nthe most recent market-related survey. (4)\n\nThe market rate for child care services\nprovided to a child determined to have special needs, pursuant to subdivision\n415.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart, is a percentage specified by the office applied to the rates set under\nparagraph 415.9(h)(3) of this Part. The special needs rate will only be applied\nif the parent demonstrates the special needs of the child require child care\nrelated services of a type or amount beyond that which is generally required by\nchildren of similar age, and the total cost of providing child care services\nexceeds the rates set in paragraph 415.9(h)(3) of this\n\nPart. (g) When a social\nservices district pays for child care services provided by an eligible provider\nlocated in another district, the applicable market rate is the rate for the\ndistrict in which the child care provider is located. This notice is intended: to serve as both a notice of emergency adoption and a notice of proposed rule\nmaking. The emergency rule will expire October 27, 2022. (h) Establishment of market rates. (1)\n\nThe Office will establish local market\nrates for child care services for each social services district set forth by\nthe type of provider, the age of the child and the amount of time the child\ncare services are provided per week. (2)\n\nThere are two market rates for informal child care, a standard\nmarket rate and an enhanced market rate. The standard market rate for informal\nchild care will be 65 percent of the applicable registered family day care\nmarket rate. The enhanced market rate for informal child care will be 70\npercent of the applicable registered family day care market rate. The enhanced\nmarket rate will apply to those informal child care providers who have provided\nnotice to, and have been verified by, the applicable enrollment agency as\nhaving completed 10 or more hours of training annually in the areas set forth\nin section\n390-a\n(3)(b)\nof the Social Services Law.
