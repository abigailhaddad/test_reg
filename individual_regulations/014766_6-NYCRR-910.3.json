  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 910.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words, or phrases hereinafter\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number assigned to any designated waters\nfor the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe\nnumbering or index system used to identify specific waters of New York State\nwas adapted from that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey series of reports on the watersheds of the State. The primary\nwaters of a drainage basin, a stream or large lake, is referred to by name or\nabbreviation. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively as they are\nencountered, such number being preceded by the letter P. This system also\ninvolves the consecutive numbering of tributaries as they enter a stream, progressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of lakes or ponds are numbered\nconsecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from\nits outlet or mouth. Isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index\nnumber merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey of the St. Lawrence River drainage basin in 1930. This report\ncovered all streams in the basin with the exception of the Raquette River which\nwas covered by a subsequent Conservation Department report in 1933, and the\n\nOswegatchie River was covered by a report in 1931. (3)\n\nThe 1930 report has been closely followed\nin connection with the identification of the waters with the following\nexceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the\nomission of streams originally shown on the older maps employed by the\n\nConservation Department at the time of its 1930 survey but not shown on newer\nmaps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps\nbut appearing on the newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (4)\n\nThe system as applied to\nthe identification of waters in the St. Lawrence River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: (i) For purposes of\nconvenience and report presentation of the recommended classification tables, the tables are divided into three sections. The designations and descriptions\nof these three sections are: (a) St. Lawrence\n\nRiver-main stem, (b) SL\nstreams-streams tributary to United States section of the St. Lawrence River, and the\n(c) SLC streams-streams\ntributary to Canadian section of St. Lawrence River. The SLC streams traverse\nthe United States-Canadian border before discharging into the St. Lawrence\n\nRiver within Canada. (5)\n\nThe following is a specific example of\nthe waters index system: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\nSL\nSt. Lawrence River\n\nThe St. Lawrence River, a primary waterway. SLC-32\n\nSt. Regis River\n\nThe 32nd tributary of the St. Lawrence River\nnumbering from the mouth upstream and numbering only those tributaries that\ndrain portions of this involved drainage basin and cross the United\n\nStates-Canadian border before discharging into the St. Lawrence River within\n\nCanada. SLC-32-40\n\nDexter Lake Outlet\n\nThe 40th tributary of the St. Regis River numbering\nfrom the Canadian border upstream. SLC-32-40-6\n\nUnnamed stream\n\nThe 6th tributary of tributary 40 of the St. Regis\n\nRiver. -P164\n\nDexter Lake\n\nPond number 164 in the St. Lawrence drainage\nbasin. SLC-32-40-6 -164-2\n\nUnnamed stream\n\nThe second tributary of Dexter Lake numbering\nclockwise from the outlet. SLC-32-40-P164 -6-2(0.2)\nA specific point\n\nThis identifies a point located on trib. 2 of\n\nDexter Lake 0.2 of a mile upstream measured along the stream bed. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib\nand\ntribs\nindicating tributary and tributaries, and the terms\nsubtributary\nand\nsubtributaries\nshall mean\nany stream, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, pond or other body of surface water; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated\nwaters shall include only the stream, pond, or other body of water referenced\nby such waters index number; where a tributary, tributaries, subtributary or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, pond, or other body of water\nreferenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries, thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Comments. The column headed \"Comments\" contains designations of\nsegments or sections of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also, included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classifications or standards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I, means map reference number and indicates one or more\nof the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on\nwhich maps the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown\nwithin the topographical limit line of the described drainage basin.
