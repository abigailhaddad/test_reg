  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2375.11 - Correspondence and oral communications\n\nState Regulations\n\nPersonnel of the Division of Taxation, at all levels, personally communicate tax policy and interpretations to thousands of\ntaxpayers, tax practitioners and members of the general public each year. These\ncommunications take many forms, such as letters, electronic mail, questionnaires, facsimile transmissions (FAX), telephone conversations, conferences, news media appearances and other speaking engagements. (The\ndivision's personnel also file papers and present oral arguments, or assist in\nsuch acts, in connection with administrative and judicial tax proceedings; however, such specialized communications are not within the scope of this\n\nPart.) The correspondence and oral communications of the personnel of the\ndivision, in themselves, are considered to be advisory only. They do not have\nlegal force or effect, precedential value or a binding nature. However, these\nmethods of communication are the basic tools by which personnel of the division\ninteract with others and advise others as to their rights and responsibilities\nunder the Tax Law, related statutes and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. (See article 41 of the Tax Law for taxpayers' rights concerning written and\noral communications with the division.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2375.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
