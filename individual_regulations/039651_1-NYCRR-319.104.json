  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 319.104 - Cured pork products, unsmoked and smoked\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Cured, unsmoked products. Cured, unsmoked, \"Boneless Pork Shoulder\", \"Boneless Pork Shoulder Butts\", or pieces\nof pork loin in casings or similar containers of consumer size, shall not\ncontain more than 10 percent added substances as a result of the curing\nprocess. (b) Smoked products. The\nweight of any smoked products such as \"Ham\", \"Pork Shoulder\", \"Pork Shoulder\n\nPicnic\", \"Pork Shoulder Butt\", or similar products, except such products\nprepared for canning, shall not exceed the weight of the fresh uncured\narticle. (c) Other cooked, cured\nproducts. The preparation of any cooked, cured products, such as \"Ham\", \"Pork\n\nShoulder\", Pork Shoulder Picnic\", Pork Shoulder Butt\", and \"Pork Loin\", or\nsimilar products, either by moist or dry heat, (except such products prepared\nfor canning), shall not result in the finished cooked product weighing more\nthan the fresh uncured article. (d) Cured, water added products. Products resembling standardized ham and other\npork products of the kinds provided for in subdivision (b) or (c) of this\nsection which do not conform to such provisions because they contain added\nwater not in excess of 10 percent of the weight of the fresh, uncured products, shall bear on their labels the term \"Water Added\", as a part of the product\nname, in prominent lettering not less than three-eighths inch in height, and if\nnot placed in a consumersize package labeled in accordance with this Part and\n\nPart 317 of this Article, shall be marked with the term \"Water Added\" the full\nlength of the product. However, the commissioner may approve smaller lettering\nfor labels of small packages, such as four-ounce packages, when he finds that\nthe size and style of the lettering in connection with the product name are\nsuch as to insure the prominence of the required terms. The qualifying phrase\n\"Up to 10 percent\" or equivalent phrase may be used in labeling such products\nin connection with the term \"Water Added\" at the option of the operator of the\nestablishment, provided the qualifying phrase does not detract from the\nprominence of the term \"Water Added\". (e) Canned products. The preparation of any\ncanned products such as \"Ham\", \"Pork Shoulder Picnic\", or similar products, shall not result in an increase in weight of more than eight percent over the\nweight of the fresh uncured article. (f) Pressed ham, spiced ham, and similar\nproducts. \"Pressed Ham\", \"Pressed Ham with Natural Juices\", \"Spiced Ham\", and\nsimilar products may contain finely chopped ham shank meat to the extent of 25\npercent over that normally present in the boneless ham. The weight of the cured\nchopped ham prior to processing shall not exceed the weight of the fresh\nuncured ham, exclusive of the bone and fat removed in the boning operation, plus the weight of the curing ingredients and three percent moisture.
