Tit. 12 §§ 4-5.8 - Stop valves and check valves\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf a boiler may be closed off from the heat distributing\nsystem by closing a steam stop valve, there shall be a check valve in the\ncondensate return line between the boiler and the system; and if any part of a\nheat distributing system may be closed off from the remainder of the system by\nclosing a steam stop valve, there shall be a check valve in the condensate\nreturn line from that part of the system. Such check valve shall be placed to\nprevent boiler contents from entering the distributing system. In lieu of a\ncheck valve in the condensate return line, a proper return loop may be\nprovided.
