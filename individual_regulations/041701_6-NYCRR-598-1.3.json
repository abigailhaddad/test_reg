  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 598-1.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following is a list of terms and definitions which\nwill be used in this Part: (a) 'Aboveground piping' means piping that rests on or is above the surface of the\nground. Depending on the circumstances, aboveground piping may be part of an\naboveground tank system or an underground tank system. This term includes\npiping located in an accessible area. (b) 'Aboveground tank system' means any tank\nsystem that is not an underground tank system. (c) 'Accessible area' means an area - such as\na room, basement cellar, shaft or vault - that allows for the physical\ninspection of the entire exterior of the tank. (d) 'Ancillary equipment means fittings, flanges, valves, pumps, and other devices that are used to distribute, meter, or control the flow of hazardous substance to and from a tank. This term does\nnot include a dispenser system. (e) 'Assembly line tanks' are tanks used in a manufacturing process. Examples of\nsuch tanks include dispensing vats, weigh tanks or volumetric measuring\ndevices, metal cleaning dip tanks, electroplating tanks and cutting fluid\nreservoirs. (f) 'Best management\npractice' plans, or BMP plans are plans designed to prevent or minimize the\nrelease of hazardous substances into the environment. BMPs can include, but are\nnot limited to, spill reporting procedures, risk identification and assessment\nemployee training, inspections and records, preventive maintenance, good\nhousekeeping, materials compatibility, structural measures and\nsecurity. (g) 'Carrier' means a\nperson who transports a hazardous substance to or from a tank system. Transporting a hazardous substance does not include dispensing a hazardous\nsubstance from a tank system. (h) 'Category 1' means any tank system component (e.g., tank, piping, ancillary\nequipment, fill port catch basins, containment sumps, secondary containment, etc.) installed before August 11, 1994. (i) 'Category 2' means any tank system\ncomponent (e.g., tank, piping, ancillary equipment, fill port catch basins, containment sumps, secondary containment, etc.) installed on or after August\n11, 1994. (j) 'Cathodic protection'\nmeans the prevention of electrolytic corrosion of a metallic structure by\ncausing it to act as the cathode rather than as the anode of an electrochemical\ncell. (k) 'Change-in-service' means\nswitching the material stored within a tank system from a hazardous substance\nto a non-hazardous substance. (l) 'Class A operator' means the individual who has primary responsibility to\noperate and maintain the underground tank system at a facility in accordance\nwith applicable requirements of this Part. The class A operator typically\nmanages resources and personnel to achieve and maintain compliance with the\nrequirements of this Part. (m) 'Class B operator' means the individual who has day-to-day responsibility for\nimplementing applicable requirements of this Part. The class B operator\ntypically implements field aspects of operation, maintenance, and associated\nrecordkeeping for the underground tank system. (n) 'Class C operator' means the individual\nwho has primary responsibility for initially addressing emergencies presented\nby a spill or release from an underground tank system. (o) 'Compatible' means, in the case of two or\nmore substances, able to maintain their respective physical and chemical\nproperties upon contact with one another for the design life of the tank system\nor container under conditions likely to be encountered in the tank system or\ncontainer.

(q) 'Corrective action plan' means a plan to\nmitigate or remedy environmental damage attributable to a release. (r) 'Department' means the New York State\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation. (s) 'Design capacity' means the amount of a\nhazardous substance that a tank is designed to hold. If a certain portion of a\ntank is unable to store a hazardous substance because of its integral design\n(for example, electrical equipment or other interior components that take up\nspace), the design capacity of the tank is thereby reduced. Actions taken to physically alter the design capacity of\na tank (such as drilling a hole in the side of the tank so that it cannot hold\na hazardous substance above that point) will not change the design capacity of\nthe tank. (t) 'Dielectric\nmaterial' means a material that does not conduct direct electrical current. For\nexample, dielectric coatings are used to electrically isolate tank systems from\nthe surrounding soils and dielectric bushings are used to electrically isolate\nportions of the tank system (e.g., tank from piping).'\n(u) 'Environment' means any water, water\nvapor, land including land surface or subsurface, air, fish, wildlife, biota, and all other natural resources. (v) 'Facility' means a single property or\ncontiguous or adjacent properties used for a common purpose owned or operated\nby the same person on or in which are located one or more tanks which are used\nfor the storage or containment of hazardous substances. (w) 'Farm' means a tract of land devoted to\nthe production of crops or raising animals, including fish, and associated\nresidences and improvements. This term includes fish hatcheries, rangeland, and\nnurseries with growing operations. (x) 'Flammable' means a substance having a\nflash point below 100°F (37.8°C) and having a vapor pressure not exceeding 40\npounds per square inch (absolute) (2,068 mm Hg) at 100° F (37.8°C). (y) 'Flash point' means the temperature at\nwhich a liquid or volatile solid gives off vapor sufficient to form an\nignitable mixture with air near the surface of the liquid or solid.

This definition does not apply to tank system components\nthe exterior of which can be fully physically inspected, or to secondarily\ncontained piping that are located completely aboveground. (ab)\n'Inaccessible area' means an area - such\nas a room, basement, cellar, shaft, or vault - that does not allow for the\nphysical inspection of the exterior of the tank. This term does not include any\nroom, basement, cellar, shaft, vault, etc. that is backfilled following tank\ninstallation. (ac)\n'Incompatible\nsubstances' means those substances which if come in contact, may pose an\nadverse environmental impact such as releasing a toxic gas or vapor, causing or\nintensifying a fire, creating an explosion, or causing any other adverse impact\nor reaction which may threaten human health, safety, welfare or the\nenvironment. (ad)\n'Install or\n'installation' means the emplacement of a tank system, or any part thereof, beneath, on, or above the ground. The movement of a tank from one location for\nuse in a different location constitutes the installation of a tank system.

(ae)\n\nLining' means a\ncoating of noncorrodible epoxy-based resins (or an equivalent coating) that is\nbonded firmly to the interior surface of a tank and which is compatible with\nthe hazardous substance stored, for the primary purpose of isolating the tank\nwall from the stored hazardous substance to prevent internal\ncorrosion. (af)\n\nLiquid' means a\nfluid which is in a state of matter intermediate between gaseous and solid. Such fluids flow immediately when stressed, the rate of flow being directly\nproportional to the stress. (ag)\n'Manifolded tanks' means tanks in a tank system which are connected so that a\nhazardous substance stored in one tank can be transferred to another tank\nwithin the tank system. (ah)\n'Operating' pressure means the pressure at which the tank system is normally\noperated. (ai)\n'Operator' means any\nperson who leases, operates, controls, or supervises a facility.

(ao)\n'Process tank' is\na vessel or other equipment used to mix or physically, chemically or\nbiologically change a hazardous substance. The term process tank does not\ninclude tanks used to store hazardous substances prior to their introduction\ninto the process, or tanks used to store substances as intermediates, by-products or finished products of the process. Examples of process tanks\ninclude, but are not limited to, flow-through chemical reactor tanks, batch\ntanks and mixing hoppers. Feed tanks upstream of the process are considered\ntanks for the purposes of these regulations. (ap)\n'PSIG' means a pounds per square inch\ngage. (aq)\n'Qualified person', 'qualified engineer', 'qualified technician' or 'qualified inspector' means a\nperson who has knowledge of the physical sciences, technology or the principles\nof engineering and mathematics acquired by education and/or related practical\nexperience and is competent to engage in the practice so required.

(av)\n'Spill', 'spillage', or 'leak' means any escape of hazardous substance from the ordinary containment\nemployed in the normal course of storage, transfer, processing, or use. Any\nescape of hazardous substance that enters containment equipment (e.g., catch\nbasin, containment sump) is a spill. (aw)\n'Stationary device' means a device that\nis not mobile. Examples of stationary devices include tank systems that are\nfixed or permanently in place on foundations, racks, cradles, or\nstilts. (ax)\n'Storage capacity'\nmeans the total volume capacity of a tank system. (ay)\n'Tank' means a stationary device\ndesigned to store hazardous substance that is constructed of non-earthen\nmaterials that provide structural support. Each compartment of a compartmented\ntank is treated as an individual tank that is part of the same tank\nsystem. (az)\n'Tank system' means\nthe tank, all associated piping, ancillary equipment, fill port catch basins, containment sumps, secondary containment, and any other containment equipment. This term includes all tank compartments as well as interconnected tanks where\nhazardous substance can flow between the tanks. This term does not include: (1)\nprocess tank systems; (2)\nassembly line tanks and accessory\nequipment which are parts of an aboveground tank system; (3)\nseptic tanks, stormwater or wastewater\ncollection systems; (4)\ncapacitors\nor transformers containing polychlorinated biphenyls; (5)\naboveground tank systems on an operating\nfarm where the hazardous substances will be used for agricultural purposes on\nsuch farm; (6)\ntank systems which\nhave been permanently closed; or\n(7)\ncontainers.
