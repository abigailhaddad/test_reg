  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 12-1.8 - Operations using flammable liquids\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Use of flammable liquids. (1)\n\nUse of certain flammable\nliquids. The use of flammable liquids for paint removal, cleaning\nor any other process in which they are unprotected and exposed shall be\nrestricted to areas provided with mechanical ventilation creating an air\nmovement of at least 100 feet per minute over the surface of the work while the\nwork is being carried on. The use of benzene for such operations is prohibited. Any solvent used shall contain not more than 3 percent benzene as an impurity. Flammable liquids shall not be used to clean walls, ceilings or floors in a\nworkroom. (2)\n\nTransfer of flammable liquids. The transfer of flammable liquids shall be by means of a\nhose or pipe leading to the bottom of the vessel being filled, except for the\nfilling of approved safety cans. When transferring such liquids from one metal\ncontainer to any other metal container, the two containers shall be bonded\ntogether electrically and be properly grounded. Exception: This paragraph does not apply to the filling of motor\nvehicle and industrial equipment fuel tanks. (3)\n\nMixing and thinning of flammable\nliquids. The mixing and thinning indoors of flammable liquids in\nunit quantities greater than 55 gallons shall be done only in a mixing or\nspraying room and in such manner and under such ventilation as will effect\ncompliance with this Part (rule). Lesser quantities shall be mixed or thinned\nindoors only in such a room or within a hood, booth or working area provided\nwith ventilation as specified in section 18.20 of Industrial Code Part (Rule\n\nNo.) 18. Exception: Quantities of five gallons or less may be mixed or\nthinned when natural ventilation will reduce the vapor concentrations to the\nlimits as specified in Table I of this Part (rule) within five minutes. (4)\n\nCoating removal by use\nof solvents. Such a process shall be provided with adequate exhaust\nventilation while the removal of residue, paint or other material is being\nperformed. The rate of ventilation shall be that specified in Industrial Code\n\nPart (Rule No.) 18. Note: The use of benzene or carbon tetrachloride for such an\noperation is prohibited. (5)\n\nCleaning solvents. Flammable liquids used for cleaning permanent surfaces\nother than floors in a working space shall have a flash point above 100 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. The use of benzene for this operation is prohibited. No flammable\nliquids shall be used to clean floors. (6)\n\nTanks, troughs and mechanical\napplication. (i) Enclosed\noperations. Enclosed operations involving the use of flammable liquids\nand any subsequent drying operations shall be mechanically ventilated to\nmaintain the concentration of vapors within the enclosures below 25 percent of\nthe lower explosive level. Necessary work openings of such enclosures shall\nhave inward air flows maintained by mechanical ventilation. As an alternative\nmethod, enclosed processes may be operated in an inert atmosphere. Where an\ninert atmosphere is used for an enclosed operation, adequate provision shall be\nmade to insure that sufficient oxygen is available in the areas surrounding\nsuch enclosed operation. Any escape of the inert atmosphere to areas outside\nthe enclosure shall not accumulate and create dangerous air\ncontaminants. (ii)\n\nFire\nprotection. Tanks and troughs containing flammable liquids shall be\nprovided with heat-actuated automatically closing covers arranged so as not to\ninterfere with exhaust ventilation. Where operations in such tanks and troughs\nare performed automatically the tanks and troughs shall be provided with\napproved fire extinguishing systems. Note: For additional requirements concerning fire protection\nsee paragraph 12-1.8(c)(1) of this Part (rule). (iii)\n\nInstallation of tanks. Tanks shall be arranged to prevent accidental tipping. (iv)\n\nHeating of liquids. Devices used for heating flammable liquids shall be provided with an automatic\ntemperature regulation device so arranged that the source of heat shall be\nautomatically shut off when the temperature of the liquid rises above the\nnormal operating temperature. (b) Storage of flammable\nliquids. (1)\n\nEnclosure of\nstorage rooms. The floor surfaces of rooms used for the storage of\nflammable liquids shall be of incombustible material and shall be waterproof. The room enclosure shall be of construction having the following minimum\nfire-resistive rating: Walls....... 1 hour\n\nDoors....... 3/4 hour\n\nWindows....... 3/4 hour\n\nCeiling (if space above is occupied)....... 1 hour\n\nFloor....... 1 hour\n\nNote: For requirements concerning fire-resistive construction\nsee Industrial Code Part (Rule No.) 7. (2)\n\nLocation of storage\nrooms. Storage rooms for flammable liquids shall be located at\nor above grade and an exterior wall of the building shall form at least one\nwall of the room. No opening in any storage room shall be located within 15\nfeet of any stairway, elevator shaft or building exit. (3)\n\nFloor drainage and door\nsills. (i) Floors of storage rooms\ncontaining flammable liquids shall be constructed so as to confine any spillage\nof flammable liquids. Solid floors shall be pitched at least one inch in 36\ninches from the walls and entrances toward a drain which shall be provided to\ndirect the liquid to a safe location outside the plant, such as a sump, tank or\nsimilar collecting basin. Every drain shall be equipped with a trap which shall\nbe kept full of a suitable liquid and so maintained as to prevent back flow of\nflammable vapors. The drainage system from any room used for the storage of\nflammable liquids shall be isolated from the plant drainage system. (ii)\n\nSills or ramps of incombustible material\nat least three inches in height shall be provided at every door leading to a\nstorage room. Alternatively, six inch deep by six inch wide gutters covered\nwith substantial open gratings and leading to drains shall be provided at such\npassageways. Such gutters shall extend across the full width of the openings\nwithin the storage rooms. (4)\n\nLimitation of\nquantities. No more than one day's supply or 220 gallons of flammable\nliquid, whichever is less, shall be kept in a workroom. Such supply, unless\nkept in closed drums or in original sealed containers not to exceed five\ngallons capacity, or in approved safety cans, shall be kept in cabinets as\nfollows: (i) Cabinets for storing\nquantities of flammable liquid not exceeding 110 gallons shall be of at least\nincombustible single wall construction and shall be vented to the outer\nair. (ii)\n\nCabinets for storing\nquantities of flammable liquid of more than 110 gallons but less than 220\ngallons shall be of incombustible double wall construction with an air space of\nat least one and one-half inches or metal-covered wood construction throughout\nand shall be vented to the outer air at top and bottom. (iii)\n\nQuantities exceeding 220 gallons shall\nbe kept in a storage room as specified in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this\nsubdivision. Doors to storage cabinets shall be kept closed and\nlatched. (5)\n\nContainers. Containers used for flammable or toxic liquids, whether\nor not they contain such material, shall be kept tightly covered when not in\nuse or when being moved about with the exception of safety cans of any size and\nglass or plastic containers which are one quart or less in size\n(volume).

There shall be provided adjacent to the inside or outside of each required exit\nfrom the room in which flammable liquids are being used or stored at least one\nhand fire extinguisher approved for the control of flammable liquid fires. Extinguishers containing carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide or other toxic\nmaterial are prohibited for this usage. In addition, there shall be at least\none approved extinguisher for each 2500 square feet of floor area so located\nthat a person shall not have to travel more than 50 feet to reach the nearest\nextinguisher. Extinguishers shall be easily accessible and protected from\ndamage. (2)\n\nElectrical equipment. (i) Wiring and equipment.
