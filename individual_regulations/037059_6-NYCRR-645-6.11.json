  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 645-6.11 - Evidence and burden of proof\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All evidence submitted must be relevant. However, other legal rules of evidence\nobserved in a court of law need not be strictly applied. Hearsay evidence may\nbe admitted if a reasonable degree of reliability is shown. (b) Although relevant, evidence may be\nexcluded if its value as proof is substantially outweighed by the potential for\nunfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, undue delay, waste of time or\nneedless presentation of repetitious or duplicative evidence. (c) Where a part of a document is offered as\nevidence by one party, any party may offer the entire document as\nevidence. (d) Whenever possible, an\nobject which is the subject of testimony shall be exhibited at the hearing. It\nshall be properly identified as relevant, and it must be shown that it has not\nchanged substantially due to the passage of time or any other reason. (e) Each witness shall be sworn or make\naffirmation before testifying. Opening, closing and other unsworn statements\nare not evidence but shall be considered as arguments bearing on\nevidence. (f) The applicant shall\nhave the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the relevant evidence\nthat the proposed activity will be in compliance with all applicable\nlaws. (g) The burden of proof to\nsustain a motion shall be on the party making the motion. (h) All decisions, determinations or orders\nshall be made upon consideration of the entire record and as supported by\nsubstantial evidence. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n645-6.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
