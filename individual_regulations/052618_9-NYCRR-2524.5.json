  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2524.5 - Grounds for refusal to renew lease or discontinue hotel tenancy and evict which require approval of the DHCR\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner shall not be required to offer a renewal lease to a tenant or\ncontinue a hotel tenancy, and shall file on the prescribed form an application\nwith the DHCR for authorization to commence an action or proceeding to recover\npossession in a court of competent jurisdiction after the expiration of the\nexisting lease term, upon any one of the following grounds: (1)\n\nWithdrawal from the rental market. The\nowner has established to the satisfaction of the DHCR after a hearing, that he\nor she seeks in good faith to withdraw any or all housing accommodations from\nboth the housing and nonhousing rental market without any intent to rent or\nsell all or any part of the land or structure and: (i) that he or she requires all or part of\nthe housing accommodations or the land for his or her own use in connection\nwith a business which he or she owns and operates; or\n(ii)\nthat substantial violations which\nconstitute fire hazards or conditions dangerous or detrimental to the life or\nhealth of the tenants have been filed against the structure containing the\nhousing accommodations by governmental agencies having jurisdiction over such\nmatters, and that the cost of removing such violations would substantially\nequal or exceed the assessed valuation of the structure. (2)\n\nDemolition. (i) The owner seeks in good faith to demolish\nthe building. As part of the application, the owner shall submit proof of its\nfinancial ability to complete such undertaking to the DHCR, and that the plans\nfor the undertaking have been approved by the appropriate city agency. Demolition shall mean the removal of the entire building including the\nfoundation. (ii)\n\nTerms and\nconditions upon which orders issued pursuant to this paragraph authorizing\nrefusal to offer renewal leases may be based: (a) The DHCR shall require an owner to pay\nall reasonable moving expenses and a stipend pursuant to subclause (3) of\nclause (b) of this subparagraph. It shall afford the tenant a reasonable period\nof time within which to vacate the housing accommodation. If the tenant vacates\nthe housing accommodation on or before the date provided in the DHCR's final\norder, such tenant shall be entitled to receive moving expenses and all stipend\nbenefits pursuant to clause (b) of this subparagraph. In addition, if the\ntenant vacates the housing accommodation prior to the required vacate date, the\nowner may also pay a stipend to the tenant that is larger than the stipend\ndesignated in subclause (3) of clause (b) of this subparagraph. However, at no\ntime shall an owner be required to pay a stipend in excess of this amount. If\nthe tenant does not vacate the housing accommodation on or before the required\nvacate date, the stipend shall be reduced by one sixth of the total stipend for\neach month the tenant remains in occupancy after such vacate date except if the\neviction is stayed by the commencement of judicial review of DHCR's order\nincluding any appeals. (b) The\norder granting the owner's demolition application shall provide that the owner\nmust either: (1)\nrelocate the tenant to a\nsuitable housing accommodation, as defined in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph, at the same or lower legal regulated rent in a closely proximate\narea, or in a new residential building if constructed on the site, in which\ncase suitable interim housing shall be provided at no additional cost to the\ntenant; plus in addition to reasonable moving expenses, payment of a $ 5,000\nstipend, provided the tenant vacates on or before the vacate date required by\nthe final order; (2)\nwhere an owner\nprovides relocation of the tenant to a suitable housing accommodation at a rent\nin excess of that for the subject housing accommodation, in addition to the\ntenant's reasonable moving expenses, the owner may be required to pay the\ntenant a stipend equal to the difference in rent, at the commencement of the\noccupancy by the tenant of the new housing accommodation, between the subject\nhousing accommodation and the housing accommodation to which the tenant is\nrelocated, multiplied by 72 months, provided the tenant vacates on or before\nthe vacate date required by the final order; or\n(3)\nin addition to the tenant's moving\nexpenses, pay the tenant a stipend which shall be the difference between the\ntenant's current rent and the average rent for vacant non-regulated apartments\nasset forth in the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey as of the date of\nthe determination. This difference is to be multiplied by 72 months. The\nstipend shall be increased each year by a guideline beginning the first year\nafter the vacancy survey is issued and continuing until a new vacancy survey is\nissued. (c) Wherever a\nstipend would result in the tenant losing a subsidy or other governmental\nbenefit which is income dependent, the tenant may elect to waive the stipend\nand have the owner at his or her own expense, relocate the tenant to a suitable\nhousing accommodation at the same or lower legal regulated rent in a closely\nproximate area. (d) In the event\nthat the tenant dies prior to the issuance by the DHCR of a final order\ngranting the owner's application, the owner shall not be required to pay such\nstipend to the estate of the deceased tenant. (e) Where the administrator's or\ncommissioner's order granting the owner's application is conditioned upon the\nowner's compliance with specified terms and conditions, if such terms and\nconditions have not been complied with, or if DHCR determines that the owner\nhas not proceeded in good faith, the order may be modified or\nrevoked. (f) Noncompliance by an\nowner with any term or condition of the administrator's or commissioner's order\ngranting the owner's application may result in DHCR initiating its own\nenforcement proceeding. The DHCR shall retain jurisdiction for this purpose\nuntil all of the terms and conditions in the administrator's or commissioner's\norder granting the owner's application have been met and the project described\nin the owner's application has been completed. Subsequent owners shall be bound\nby the terms and conditions of DHCR's order. This clause shall not be deemed to\neliminate any remedy or claim that a tenant of the dwelling unit may otherwise\nhave against the owner nor eliminate any independent authority that DHCR may be\nable to exercise by law or regulation. (g) An owner's failure to comply within a\nreasonable amount of time with any term or condition of the administrator's or\ncommissioner's order granting the owner's application or an owner's failure to\ncomplete the project described in the owner's application may be found to be a\nviolation of the RSL and the RSC and subject to any of the penalties and\nremedies described therein including but not limited to revocation of the\nadministrator's or commissioner's order granting the owner's application and\nDHCR's continued jurisdiction under the RSL over the building or any subsequent\nconstruction. Any remedies and penalties prescribed by this Code shall apply to\nand be binding against subsequent owners. (iii)\n\nComparable housing accommodations and\nrelocation. In the event a comparable housing accommodation is offered by the\nowner, a tenant may file an objection with the DHCR challenging the suitability\nof a housing accommodation offered by the owner for relocation within 10 days\nafter the owner identifies the housing accommodation and makes it available for\nthe tenant to inspect and consider the suitability thereof. Within 30 days\nthereafter, the DHCR shall inspect the housing accommodation, on notice to both\nparties, in order to determine whether the offered housing accommodation is\nsuitable. Such determination will be made by the DHCR as promptly as\npracticable thereafter. In the event that the DHCR determines that the housing\naccommodation is not suitable, the tenant shall be offered another housing\naccommodation, and shall have 10 days after it is made available by the owner\nfor the tenant's inspection to consider its suitability. In the event that the\nDHCR determines that the housing accommodation is suitable, the tenant shall\nhave 15 days thereafter within which to accept the housing accommodation. A\ntenant who refuses to accept relocation to any housing accommodation determined\nby the DHCR to be suitable shall lose the right to relocation by the owner, and\nto receive payment of moving expenses or any stipend. \"Suitable housing\naccommodations\" shall mean housing accommodations which are similar in size and\nfeatures to the respective housing accommodations now occupied by the tenants. Such housing accommodations shall be freshly painted before the tenant takes\noccupancy, and shall be provided with substantially the same required services\nand equipment the tenants received in their prior housing accommodations. The\nbuilding containing such housing accommodations shall be free from violations\nof law recorded by the City agency having jurisdiction, which constitute fire\nhazards or conditions dangerous or detrimental to life or health, or which\naffect the maintenance of required services. The DHCR will consider housing\naccommodations proposed for relocation which are not presently subject to rent\nregulation, provided the owner submits a contractual agreement that places the\ntenant in a substantially similar housing accommodation at no additional rent\nfor a period of six years, unless the tenant requests a shorter lease period in\nwriting. (3)\n\nOther\ngrounds. The owner will eliminate inadequate, unsafe or unsanitary conditions\nand demolish or rehabilitate the dwelling unit pursuant to the provisions of\narticle VIII, VIII-A, XIV, XV or XVIII of the PHFL, the Housing New York\n\nProgram Act, or sections 8 and 17 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (National\n\nHousing Act), on the condition that the owner: (i) proves that it has a commitment for the\nrequired financing; (ii)\nproves\nthat any rehabilitation requires the temporary removal of the tenant; and\n(iii)\nagrees to offer and will\noffer the tenants the right of first occupancy following any rehabilitation at\nan initial rent as determined pursuant to the applicable law and subject to any\nterms and conditions established pursuant to applicable law and\nregulations. (b) Election not to renew. Once an\napplication is filed under this section, with notification to all, the owner\nmay refuse to renew all tenants' leases until a determination affected tenants\nof the owner's application is made by the DHCR. For the purposes of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (a) of this section, service of the application at any time\nshall be considered sufficient compliance with section\n2524.2\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Part provided that no order may be issued less than 90 days from the date\nthe last affected tenant's lease has expired. If such application is denied, or\nwithdrawn, prospective renewal leases must be offered to all affected tenants\nwithin such time and at such guideline rates as directed in the DHCR order of\ndenial or withdrawal. (c) Terms and\nconditions upon which orders authorizing refusal to offer renewal leases may be\nbased. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the\nDHCR shall require an owner to pay all reasonable moving expenses and shall\nfurther condition the order upon the payment of a reasonable stipend and/or the\nrelocation of the tenant by the owner to a suitable housing accommodation at\nthe same or lower regulated rent in a closely proximate area. If no such\nhousing accommodation is available at the same or lower regulated rent, the\nowner may be required to pay the difference in rent between the subject housing\naccommodation and the new housing accommodation to which the tenant is\nrelocated for such period as the DHCR determines, commencing with the occupancy\nof the new housing accommodation by the tenant. (d) Any order granting an application\npursuant to this section shall not provide for a stay of eviction which exceeds\none year. In addition, where the order of the DHCR is conditioned upon the\nowner's compliance with specified terms and conditions, if such terms and\nconditions have not been complied with, the order may be modified or\nrevoked.
