  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 213.3 - Prohibition\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After January\n1, 1971, no person shall cause, permit or allow the emission of air\ncontaminants, which will exceed the limits specified in table 1[FN*], from any\nferrous jobbing foundry cupola or ferrous jobbing foundry open hearth in\noperation on or prior to the effective date of this Part, this prohibition to\nbe applicable, also, to modifications made after the effective date of this\n\nPart, to such a cupola or open hearth. (b) The commissioner may modify the limits\nspecified in table 1 [Appendix 4, infra], if in view of the properties of the\nemissions, isolated conditions, stack height and other factors, it can be\nclearly demonstrated that discharge of the contaminant or contaminants will not\nresult in measurable or observable effects on receptors, nor add to an existing\nor predictable atmosphere burden of such contaminant or contaminants so that\nadverse effects would reasonably be expected therefrom. (c) The provisions of this section shall not\nbe construed to allow or permit any person to emit air contaminants in\nquantities which alone or in combination with other sources would contravene\nany established air quality standards. In such cases the commissioner may\nspecify the degree of treatment required. [FN*] See Appendix 4, infra. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n213.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
