  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 55.4 - Post-list appeal procedure\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn cases other than those in which prior approval of the\nrating key has been granted by the commission or review and submission of\nobjections have been invited under section\n55.3\nof this Part, a committee on\nappeals shall consider appeals subsequent to the establishment of the eligible\nlist subject to the following terms and conditions: (a) Upon the establishment of an eligible\nlist resulting from competitive examination, the department shall notify each\ncandidate therein of the rating he has received and, if such rating be above\nthe required minimum, of his comparative standing on the eligible list. Any\ncandidate receiving such notice may personally inspect his examination papers\nin the presence of a designated representative of the department, provided he\nmakes request for such inspection, in writing, within the period of five\nbusiness days after the date of postmark of such notice, and provided that\neither he received a rating of 65 or higher if the examination consisted wholly\nof short-answer type questions (i.e., multiple-choice, or other questions which\nare scored only as wholly right or wholly wrong) or he received a rating of 60\nor higher if the examination consisted of other types of questions or he is\ngranted special permission by the commission to inspect his papers. (b) A candidate who wishes to appeal to the\ncommission from his rating in one, or more, or all of the subjects of an\nexamination in order to establish eligibility or improve his relative standing\nmust submit such appeal in writing at the review center on the date or dates on\nwhich his examination papers are made available for his inspection. Such appeal\nshall be considered as opening for review all of the competitor's papers in\nsuch subject or subjects of the examination on which he has appealed, whether\nresulting in a higher or lower average rating in such subject or subjects of\nthe examination. However, unless by special action of the commission, no\nconsideration shall be given an appeal for re-rating of a subject of the\nexamination rated below 60 or for the re-rating of a written examination rated\nbelow 65 where such written examination consists wholly of short-answer type\nquestions (i.e., multiple-choice, or other questions which are scored only as\nwholly right or wholly wrong). (c) The commission shall correct any manifest error or mistake of marking or rating\nappearing in the candidate's examination papers or records in the subject or\nsubjects of the examination on which he has appealed but such correction shall\nnot prejudice the status of any person previously appointed as a result of such\nexamination. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4\n§\n55.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
