  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 165.10 - Structural integrity and safety rating system\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Structural integrity and safety rating\nrefers to a systematic method for evaluating and ranking the relative\nstructural integrity and safety of a bridge or group of bridges against\nstructural failure and/or collapse. A structural integrity and safety rating\nsystem shall, at a minimum, consider the following fundamental bridge\nvulnerability factors, where applicable: (1)\n\nCondition: refers to the extent of deterioration and/or loss of ability to\nstructurally function as was intended by its original or rehabilitated design\nor loss of structural safety. (2)\n\nLoad capacity: refers to the ability to safely carry live loads that may be\nimposed upon the bridge. (3)\n\nRedundancy: refers to the bridge's ability to retain structural capacity, stability and servicability if one or more primary load carrying components or\nprimary structural members were to structurally fail. (4)\n\nFracture susceptibility: a measure of the\npresence of details and/or behavioral characteristics that are prone to\nfracture. (5)\n\nHydraulic\nvulnerability: refers to the bridge's potential for failure due to its exposure\nto hydraulic forces, or due to erosion or scour of the foundation material. The rating system has the capability to rank the relative\nstructural integrity of bridges, as well as identify bridges that have any\nsignificant vulnerability with regard to any one or a number of the above-noted\nvulnerability factors. (b) Structural integrity and safety ratings\nshall be made for all bridges. The rating system to be used shall be either the\nsystem developed by the New York State Department of Transportation for use on\nits bridges or the public entity may develop a rating system unique for bridges\nunder its jurisdiction. Any public entity that establishes a rating system for\nuse in complying with this Code shall file with the New York State Department\nof Transportation a description of the rationale and/or logic of the rating\nmethod, as well as a list of integrity ratings for all bridges under their\njurisdiction. Filing of rating systems and bridge structural integrity and\nsafety ratings shall be with the New York State Department of Transportation\n\nMain Office Structures Division. Structural integrity and safety ratings shall\nbe updated on a biennial basis to reflect any changes recorded by general\ninspections. (c) The New York State\n\nDepartment of Transportation shall maintain a structural integrity and safety\nrating system which it will apply to all bridges which it inspects. This system\nis to be made available to all public entities for their own use. The\ndescription and criteria of the New York State Department of Transportation\nstructural integrity and safety ratings are issued as a reference document to\nthis Code, and is titled \"New York State Department of Transportation\n\nStructural Integrity and Safety Rating Guide.\" This document also contains\ncriteria, based on a structural integrity and safety rating system, for\nrequiring a Structural Integrity Evaluation as described in section\n165.11\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n165.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
