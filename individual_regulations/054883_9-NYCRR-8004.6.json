For the purposes of this section, contact with any\nlaw enforcement agency does not include a formal accusation of criminal\nbehavior, or an arrest. (b) Technical violations for which no period\nof reincarceration may be imposed in the parole revocation process also include\nviolations of a special condition, other than that which may be specifically\nidentified in subdivision (a) of this section, where the failure could be\nsafely addressed in the community or that there exists other reasonable\ncommunity-based means to address the failure which have not been\nexhausted. (c) A technical\nviolation case in which no period of reincarceration may be imposed may consist\nof: (1)\ncharges alleging the violative\nconduct specified in subdivisions (a) and/or (b), (2)\ncharges that allege technical violations\nbut wherein, despite the presence of charges alleging conduct identified\nsubdivision (a) of section\n8004.7\nof this Part, the charges\nare not of sufficient number to permit reincarceration as explained in\nsubdivision (b) of that section. (d) If the case has been identified as a\ntechnical violation case in which no period of reincarceration may be imposed, a notice of violation may be approved for prosecution and: (1)\n\nIf the releasee appears as directed in\nresponse to the notice of violation, the parole revocation process shall\ncontinue and the releasee afforded the right to a preliminary revocation\nhearing if such right is not waived; or\n(2)\n\nIf the releasee has intentionally failed\nto appear as directed in response to the notice of violation and has\nintentionally failed to appear within forty-eight hours after such time, no\nparole warrant may be issued and the violation charges shall be deemed\nsustained. (i) In such case, notice of the\ndecision shall be promptly served upon the releasee. Acceptable service in this\nregard occurs when the releasee is served with notice of the decision within a\nreasonable amount of time under the totality of the circumstances, and such\nservice may include, but not be limited to, delivering the notice of decision\nto the releasee's approved address, or last known address if different than the\napproved address. (ii)\n\nWithin one\nmonth of the date the notice of decision was served upon the releasee, the\nreleasee may move to vacate such sustained violation(s) if the releasee can\nshow by a preponderance of the evidence that the notice of violation was not\nproperly served or the failure to appear was otherwise excusable. (a) The releasee may make this motion by\npaper submission only, filed with the Board of Parole Appeals Unit, at the\n\nBoard of Parole, New York State Department of Corrections and Community\n\nSupervision, 1220 Washington Avenue, Albany, New York 12226. The motion must\ninclude a copy of the notice of decision.

(b) The Department may respond to the motion\nby submission to the Board of Parole Appeals Unit. Nothing shall preclude the\n\nAppeals Unit or other Board staff from obtaining additional information as may\nbe relevant to the case and decision, including information from Department\nstaff and records. (c) Following a\nreview of the motion, any response submitted the Department, and any additional\ninformation that may be deemed relevant by the Appeals Unit, the Unit will make\na recommendation to the Board of Parole for determination. The matter will\nthereafter be considered by at least one member of the Board for their\ndetermination. (d) If it is\ndetermined that the releasee has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that\nthe notice of violation was not properly served or the failure to appear was\notherwise excusable, the revocation case will be reopened as may be\ndirected. (e) Where it is\ndetermined that the releasee failed to make the required showing, the automatic\nsustaining of the violation charges and revocation shall stand. (f) Motions provided for in this subparagraph\nshall not be considered administrative appeals pursuant to Part 8006 of this\n\nTitle, and the process for their review and determination may be further\nregulated pursuant to policy and procedures of the Board of Parole. The\ndetermination upon any such review shall be an exhaustion of administrative\nremedies on the motion and not subject to further administrative review or\nconsideration by the Board. Notes\nN.Y.
