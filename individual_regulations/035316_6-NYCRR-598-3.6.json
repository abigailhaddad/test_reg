  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 598-3.6 - Out-of-service aboveground tank systems and closure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Out-of-service AST systems. (1)\n\nAn AST system is out of service if: (i) the facility owner (or their authorized\nrepresentative) takes the tank system out of service by submitting an\napplication to the department, in accordance with paragraph 1.14(a)(5) of this\n\nPart, indicating that the tank system is out of service; or\n(ii)\nthe tank system is no longer receiving\nor dispensing a hazardous substance, unless the tank system is used for standby\nstorage or is part of a closed-loop system. Records explaining why a tank\nsystem that no longer receives or dispenses hazardous substance is not out of\nservice, must be retained until the tank system is permanently closed and made\npart of the spill prevention report. Within 30 days after the tank system\nbecomes out of service, the facility owner (or their authorized representative)\nmust submit an application to the department, in accordance with paragraph\n1.14(a)(5) of this Part, indicating that the tank system is out of\nservice. (2)\n\nOut-of-service AST systems are still subject to all applicable requirements of\nthis Part, with the exception of periodic inspections and leak detection\nrequired under subdivisions\n3.2\n(c) and\n3.3\n(a) and (b)\nof\nthis Subpart, respectively, if the AST system is empty. (An AST system is\nconsidered empty when all hazardous substance has been removed using commonly\nemployed practices so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue\nremain in the AST system.)\n(i) The suspended\nrequirements of subdivisions\n3.2\n(c) and\n3.3\n(a) and (b)\nof\nthis Subpart must resume in accordance with the original schedule when the AST\nsystem is returned to service. However, if the AST system has been out of\nservice such that any of the next periodic inspections or leak detection was\nnot conducted in accordance with the original schedule, the inspections and\nleak detection must be performed when the AST system is returned to\nservice. (ii)\n\nFor AST systems taken\nout of service due to repairs (in response to a leak), the repair and\nsubsequent testing requirements of subdivision\n3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart must be successfully completed before the AST system is returned to\nservice. (3)\n\nWhen an AST\nsystem is out-of-service for 30 or more days, the following must be performed: (i) The tank must be emptied so that no more\nthan 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue remains. Any hazardous waste that is\nremoved from the tank system must be disposed of in accordance with all\napplicable State, local and Federal requirements. Tanks must be protected from\nfloatation in accordance with generally accepted engineering\npractices; (ii)\n\nVent lines must be\nleft open and functioning; and\n(iii)\n\nAll piping, manways, fill ports, gauge\nopenings, vapor returns, pump connections, and ancillary equipment must be\ncapped and secured. (4)\nAST systems that are out-of-service for more than one year must be inspected in\naccordance with paragraph 3.3(c)(3) of this Subpart or tested in accordance\nwith paragraphs 3.3(c)(1) and 3.3(d)(2) of this Subpart and determined to be\nstructurally sound and tight before being returned to\nservice. (b) Permanent\nclosure of tank systems. To permanently close a tank system, the tank system\nmust be meet the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision or undergo a\nchange-in-service in accordance with paragraph\n(2)\nof this subdivision. (1)\nA tank system must be closed in\naccordance with the following: (i) At least 30\ndays before permanent closure, the facility owner (or their authorized\nrepresentative) must notify the department of this action, unless such action\nis in response to corrective action in accordance with Subpart 6 of this\n\nPart. (ii)\nliquid and sludge must\nbe removed from the tank system. Any removed hazardous waste must be\ntransported and disposed of in accordance with all applicable State, local and\n\nFederal requirements; (iii)\nthe\ntank must be cleaned and rendered free of hazardous vapors. Provisions must be\nmade for natural breathing of the tank to ensure that the tank remains free of\nhazardous vapors; (iv)\nall piping\nmust be disconnected and removed or securely capped or locked out or plugged. Manways must be securely fastened in place; (v) tanks must be stenciled with the date of\npermanent closure; (vi)\nif a tank\nis to be disposed of, it must be retested for hazardous vapors, rendered vapor\nfree if necessary, cleaned of any residuals or sludge, and punched with holes\nor otherwise made unfit for storage; and\n(vii)\nall tanks must be protected from\nfloatation caused by flooding or high ground water level in accordance with\ngenerally accepted engineering practices. (viii)\nsecondary containment systems of\npermanently closed aboveground tank systems must have drainage for accumulated\nwater or precipitation. (ix)\n\nWithin\n30 days after permanent closure, the facility owner (or their authorized\nrepresentative) must submit an application to the department, in accordance\nwith paragraph 1.14(a)(6) of this Part, indicating that the AST system has been\npermanently closed. (2)\nA\ntank system must undergo a change-in-service in accordance with the following: (i) At least 30 days before permanent\nclosure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must notify\nthe department of this action, unless such action is in response to corrective\naction in accordance with Subpart 6 of this Part. (ii)\nliquid and sludge must be removed from\nthe tank system. Any removed hazardous waste must be transported and disposed\nof in accordance with all applicable State, local and Federal\nrequirements; (iii)\nthe tank must\nbe cleaned and rendered free of hazardous vapors. Provisions must be made for\nnatural breathing of the tank to ensure that the tank remains free of hazardous\nvapors; (iv)\n\nWithin 30 days after\npermanent closure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must\nsubmit an application to the department, in accordance with paragraph\n1.14(a)(6) of this Part, indicating that the AST system has been permanently\nclosed. (c) Closure of tank systems abandoned prior\nto August 11, 1994. All tanks taken out-of-service, but still in or on the\nground, prior to August 11, 1994 must be closed in accordance with the\nrequirements of subdivision (b) of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
