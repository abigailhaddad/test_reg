  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-8.6 - Multiple abatement within a single regulated abatement work area\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Simultaneous\nabatement. Simultaneous or concurrent abatement of multiple types of ACM within\na single regulated abatement work area shall not be allowed, unless the\nmultiple types of ACM are part of the same system (e.g., floor tile/cove base\nand mastics, or ceiling/wall tile and mastic). Simultaneous removals are\nallowed on a project as long as they are within different regulated abatement\nwork areas. (b) Requirements for\nsequential abatement. When multiple types of abatement work are done in a\ncommon regulated abatement work area or enclosure, a sequential order of\nabatement is required as shown below. (1)\n\nInitial plasticizing. Initial plasticizing of the containment area shall be as\nrequired for the most stringent case of removal. (2)\n\nSequential removal. Sequential removal\nshall allow for only one type of removal of ACM at a time in a sequential order\nwithin the work area until that type of material is completely removed. Thereafter, another type of ACM can be removed within the same work area. Relief from plasticizing is for the surfaces to be abated only at the time of\nthat specific material abatement. Other surfaces shall be plasticized as the\nmaterial being abated dictate, except as noted below. (i) Order of sequential abatement. The\nfollowing sequence of abatement within a work area shall begin at the ceiling\nor upper level and progress one material at a time down to the floor and from\nmost friable material to least friable material. (ii)\n\nExample: (a) First. All ceiling fireproofing, ceiling\nplaster or similar ceiling OSHA Class I friable material shall be completely\nabated so that no visible exposed ACM, PACM or asbestos material remains. Then\nthe friable mechanical/tank insulation, isolation/ vibration damper material\nand thermal pipe, ducts, pipe fitting insulation, mudded firebrick, or similar\nOSHA Class I or Class II friable material shall be completely abated so that no\nvisible exposed material remnants remain. Glovebags may be used. After all\nfriable ACM has been abated, the area shall be cleaned of all debris/residue\nusing HEPA vacuuming and wet wiping. (b) Second. OSHA Class II non-friable\nmaterials shall be abated. If other areas/surfaces were abated, no new\nplasticization shall be required. Ceiling and wall tiles, transite, interior\nwindow glazing, expansion joint, millboard and other NESHAP Category I and II\nnon-friable ACM shall be abated so that no visible exposed material remnants\nremain and the area shall be cleaned of all debris/residue using HEPA vacuuming\nand wet wiping. (c) Last. OSHA\nClass II non-friable flooring abatement shall be last. Non-friable ACM flooring\nmaterials and ACM mastic shall be abated so that no visible exposed material\nremnants remain and the area shall be cleaned of all debris/residue using HEPA\nvacuuming and wet wiping. If beadblaster or a similar abrasive type of\nabatement method is used, full work area preparation, including establishment\nof negative pressure filtration systems, shall be required and this abatement\nmay be done as one of the first types of abatement and then the flooring area\nabated shall be re-plasticized with a double-layer of six-mil fire-retardant\nplastic sheeting, to be utilized as a dropcloth during the remaining\nabatement. (iii)\n\nTemporary walls. New temporary hardwalls used to separate an enclosed regulated\nabatement work area into smaller regulated abatement work area enclosures shall\nbe constructed as per section\n56-7.11\n(b) of\nthis Part. Existing columns, I beams and interior walls may be used to support\nor to act as part of the new containment walls provided that the existing\nwalls, columns, and I beams to which these temporary walls are to be attached\nor used shall be completely abated prior to the erection of these new\ncontainment walls to allow this attachment. Caulk, fire-retardant expandable\nfoam or duct tape shall be used to form an airtight seal for these partitions. (a) Airlock. Each newly enclosed regulated\nabatement work area shall have an attached airlock as defined in section\n56-2.1\nof this Part, and the\nairlock shall be constructed at the enclosure entrance, as per section\n56-7.5\n(b)(11)\nof\nthis Part. Each enclosure and airlock shall be cordoned off 25 feet from its\nperimeter. Critical openings within the cordoned off area shall be covered with\ntwo layers of six mil fire-retardant polyethylene in conformance to section 56-\n7.11(a) of this Part. (iv)\n\nIntermediate completions. On completion\nof each type of asbestos abatement within these work area enclosures, a\ncomplete single clean of all surfaces in the entire area - ceiling, walls and\nfloors - shall be performed by HEPA vacuuming and wet wiping. No final\nclearance air samples shall be required for each individual type of material\nabatement, until the last type of ACM, PACM or asbestos material is abated. Each intermediate completion shall include a visual inspection for completeness\nby the supervisor. Results of the visual inspection and time of intermediate\ncompletion shall be documented by the supervisor in the daily project\nlog. (v) Final required cleaning. A\ncomplete single clean of all surfaces in the entire area -- ceiling, walls and\nfloors, followed by a visual inspection as described in Subpart 56-9 of this\n\nPart shall be performed by HEPA vacuuming and wet wiping, after all abatement\nis complete. (vi)\n\nFinal clearance\nair samples. After the final cleaning and visual inspection requirements are\ncompleted and the final settling/drying period is observed, prior to\ndismantling the regulated abatement work area, Phase IIC final clearance air\nsamples shall be collected and satisfactory clearance air results obtained as\nper section\n56-9.2\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-8.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
