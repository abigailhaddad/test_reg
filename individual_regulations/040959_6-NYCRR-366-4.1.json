The\ndepartment will determine if the draft LSWMP contains all the required elements\nidentified in this Part for purposes of commencing review and will provide\nwritten notification to the planning unit of its completeness determination\nwithin 30 calendar days of receipt of the draft LSWMP. If written notification\nis not provided within 30 calendar days of receipt of the draft LSWMP, the\ndraft LSWMP will be deemed complete, by default, for the purposes of this\nsubdivision.

(2)\n\nIf the department\ndetermines that the draft LSWMP does not adequately address all the basic\nelements of a LSWMP, the draft LSWMP will be deemed incomplete and the planning\nunit will be advised in writing of the deficiencies and will be required to\nresubmit a revised draft LSWMP for review.

The department will review the complete draft LSWMP to\ndetermine whether it adequately addresses all required elements identified in\nthis Part and will provide written notification to the planning unit of its\ndetermination within 120 calendar days after the date the draft LSWMP is deemed\ncomplete. If written notification is not provided within 120 calendar days, the\ncomplete draft LSWMP will be considered approvable. (1)\n\nIf the department determines that the\ncomplete draft LSWMP adequately addresses all required elements, the written\nnotification provided by the department to the planning unit will advise that\nthe complete draft LSWMP is approvable and that a final LSWMP must be prepared\nin accordance with subdivision\n366-4.1\n(d) of this\nsection.

For the second and any\nsubsequent reviews of the revised complete draft LSWMP, the revised complete\ndraft LSWMP will be considered approvable if written notification to the\nplanning unit advising of any deficiencies is not provided from the department\nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the revised complete draft\nLSWMP. (c) If, the\napprovable LSWMP differs substantively from the first draft LSWMP, as\ndetermined by the department or planning unit, the planning unit must commence\nan additional public comment period in accordance with Subpart 366-3 of this\n\nPart. A responsiveness summary must be submitted to the department as part of a\nrevised approvable LSWMP, which will include all changes to the approvable\nLSWMP based on the additional public comments, with a letter summarizing these\nchanges. The department will provide written notification to the planning unit\nwithin 30 calendar days of receipt of the revised approvable LSWMP whether the\nrevised approvable LSWMP is accepted. If written notification to the planning\nunit is not provided within 30 calendar days, the revised approvable LSWMP will\nbe considered accepted. (d) Final\nLSWMP.
