  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-8.1 - Adoption of New York State Employees Retirement System\n\nState Regulations\n\nLocal agencies may secure retirement benefits for their\nemployees by adopting the New York State Employees Retirement System, pursuant\nto sections 55 and 56 of the State Civil Service Law. A municipality may adopt\nthe system by filing a certified copy of an appropriate resolution approved by\nthe local legislative body, with the State Comptroller. A local housing\nauthority may adopt the system by passage of an appropriate resolution, a\ncertified copy of which is filed with the Comptroller, but the acceptance of\nthe employees of the authority for membership in the system is optional with\nthe State Comptroller. Full information as to the adoption and operation of the\nsystem, payroll procedures, rates of contribution, etc., may be had by writing\nto the State Comptroller, Albany, New York. The general comments which follow\nare intended to be informative, rather than exhaustive, and are based on\ninformation supplied by the Comptroller: (a) The election to adopt the New York State\n\nEmployees Retirement System is optional with the local agency. The election, once made, is, however, irrevocable. (b) On adoption of the system, all persons\nemployed as of the date of adoption will have the opportunity to elect whether\nor not to become members of the system. After adoption, all new employees who\nare in the competitive or noncompetitive class of the classified Civil Service\nmust become members of the system as of date of appointment. For others, membership is optional. (c) Persons\nemployed as of the date of adoption of the system who elect to become members\nwithin the first year after adoption must, by law, receive credit for service\nrendered prior to the date of adoption. The credit for prior service represents\na charge to the local agency but is free to the employee. After adoption and\nmembership of any employee, the cost is shared by the local agency and the\nemployee. In order that there be no lapse in service, it is advisable for all\nemployees to pay the necessary contributions on all salary received from the\ndate of adoption until membership is consummated. If the applications for\nmembership are received one month after date of adoption, the Comptroller will\nregister the employees for membership in the system as of the date of adoption\nand the local agency will be advised as to the contributions to be taken from\nfuture salary. The prompt establishment of the employee's rate of contribution\nis recommended. (d) The over-all\nrate of contribution by the local agency is made up of the following: (1)\nA normal contribution rate to balance the\ncontribution of the employer member. (2)\nA special deficiency contribution rate to\napply to the aggregate payroll of members for a period of 30 years. (3)\n\nAn administration contribution\nrate. (e) The accrued\nliability of the local agency will not, ordinarily, be determined by the\n\nComptroller until one year after adoption. The cost of determining the accrued\nliability will be a charge to the local agency. However, subject to a\ndefinitive determination at the end of the first year after adoption, the\n\nComptroller will, if the local agency so desires, determine a tentative special\ndeficiency contribution rate before the end of the first year. There is an\nadditional charge for this service. The establishment of a tentative special\ndeficiency contribution rate is recommended as it has the advantage of\npermitting the local agency to begin accruing its liability with respect to\ncurrent payrolls immediately. The accruals can then be adjusted when the\naccrued liability of the local agency is definitively determined by the\n\nComptroller as of the end of the first year after adoption. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
