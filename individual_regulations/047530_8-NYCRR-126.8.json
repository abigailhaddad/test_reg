Tit. 8 § 126.8 - Financial Viability and Reporting\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll schools shall meet and maintain the standards of\nfinancial viability and reporting set forth in this section as a requirement\nand condition of licensure or certification. For the purposes of this section, school shall mean school as it is defined in subdivision (p) of section\n126.1\nof this Title and shall\nadditionally include Certified English as a second language schools as defined\nin subdivision (x) of section\n126.1. (a) General standards of financial viability. (1)\n\nThe commissioner shall consider a school\nto be financially viable if the commissioner determines that: (i) the school's equity, primary reserve, and\nnet income ratios yield a composite score of at least 1.5, using the\nmethodology set forth in federal regulation\n34 CFR section\n668.172. The composite score shall be\ncalculated at the highest level of ownership; and\n(ii)\nthe school is able to meet all of its\nfinancial obligations and provide the administrative resources necessary to\ncomply with all licensure or certification requirements. A school is deemed\nunable to meet its financial or administrative obligations pursuant to this\nparagraph if: (a) the school does not have\nsufficient operating cash flow and liquidity, as determined by the\ncommissioner; or\n(b) the school is\nsubject to any of the triggering events set forth in subdivision (b) of this\nsection and the commissioner determines such triggering event is likely to have\na material adverse effect on the financial condition of the school or indicates\na distressed financial condition. (2)\n\nNo school shall be considered financially\nviable pursuant to this subdivision where a school owner: (i) owes an outstanding liability to the\ndepartment for the school or any other licensed or certified school, previously\nlicensed or certified school, or unlicensed school for which the owner has or\npreviously had an ownership interest and fails to demonstrate that such\nliability is being paid in accordance with law, regulation, order, settlement, or other written agreement with the department; or\n(ii)\nowes a liability to the department for\nany violation of Article 101 of the Education Law or this Part and fails to\ndemonstrate that such liability is being paid in accordance with law, regulation, order, settlement, or other written agreement with the\ndepartment. (b) Triggering events. (1)\n\nThe commissioner may determine that a\nschool is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations upon\noccurrence of any of the following triggering events and a subsequent\ndetermination by the commissioner that such event is likely to have a material\nadverse effect on the financial condition of the school or indicate a\ndistressed financial condition: (i) the\nschool's financial statement, regardless of the school's composite score, contains any adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinions, or any disclosure in\nthe notes to the financial statement that there is substantial doubt about the\nschool's ability to continue as a going concern in accordance with United\n\nStates generally accepted accounting principles; (ii)\nfailure to timely and completely pay any\nassessments that may be due pursuant to sections\n5001\n(9), 5007\n(10)(d), and\n5007\n(10)(e)\nof the Education Law, and section\n126.10\n(j)(11)\nof\nthis Part; (iii)\nfailure to timely\nand completely submit any financial statements that may be due pursuant to\nsection\n5001\n(4)\nof the Education Law and section\n126.10\n(j)(11)\nof\nthis Part; (iv)\nfailure to timely\npay a student refund where a school is required to pay such refund pursuant to\n\nArticle 101 of the Education Law and this Part, or under any other law, regulation, or accreditation standard, or any failure to timely pay such\nrefund; (v) the school has an\nunacceptable level of annual student dropout/withdrawal rates, as determined by\nthe commissioner; (vi)\nthe school\ndemonstrates a precipitous decline in student enrollment or gross tuition\nincome, as determined by the commissioner; (vii)\nviolation of a provision or requirement\nin a security or loan agreement with a creditor; (viii)\nfailure to make a timely lease, rent\nor other debt service payment; or any notice of eviction, order to vacate, or\nany other event or action that may impact a school's ability to operate at its\nlicensed location; (ix)\nissuance of\na notice or order by a school's accrediting agency, such as an order to show\ncause or similar action, that, if not satisfied, could result in the\nwithdrawal, revocation or suspension of institutional accreditation for failing\nto meet one or more of the agency's standards; (x) if the school is publicly traded, any\nmaterial adverse action taken against the school by the United States\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to revocation of\nregistration, delisting, or sanction for untimely or incomplete filing of\nrequired reports; (xi)\nany notice, order, or action taken by the United States government or an agent or\ninstrumentality thereof that could result in the withdrawal, revocation, or\nsuspension of a school's federal Student Exchange Visitor Program\ncertification; or\n(xii)\nany\nsubstantial withdrawal of owner equity from the school by any means that\nresults in, or that the commissioner determines will likely result in, the\nschool's composite score falling below 1.0. (2)\n\nSchools must notify the department in\nwriting, within five days of the occurrence of any action or event identified\nin subparagraphs (vii) through (xii) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Upon\nreceiving such notice, the commissioner may require the school to provide\nadditional information and reports, and may require the school to notify\nstudents and provide students with information and guidance regarding the\npotential implications of the action or event on student enrollment status, continued instruction, tuition funds and refunds, as well as all transfer\noptions. (c) Alternative\nstandards of financial viability. The commissioner may permit a school that is\nnot financially viable under the general standards set forth in subdivision (a)\nof this section, to be licensed or certified or continue its licensed or\ncertified operation by meeting one of the alternate standards set forth in this\nsubdivision. (1)\n\nZone alternative. A school\nthat does not meet the general standards of financial viability solely because\nthe commissioner determines that the composite score for its most recent fiscal\nyear falls below 1.5 may nevertheless be found financially viable if: (1)\nthe commissioner approves a plan, submitted by the school, which adequately details the actions the school is\ntaking to improve its financial viability and to mitigate any risk to the\ninterruption or cessation of instruction and to student tuition funds; and\n(2)\nmaintains a composite score\nof between 1.0 and 1.4 or higher for each of its two subsequent fiscal years. (i) The commissioner shall notify any such\nschool in writing that it is eligible for the zone alternative. (ii)\n\nThe plan shall be received no later than\nsixty days from the date of the commissioner's notice to the school of its\neligibility for the zone alternative. (iii)\nA school may qualify for this\nalternative for no more than three consecutive years. (2)\n\nProbation. A school that does\nnot meet the general standards of financial viability and does not qualify for\nthe zone alternative may be placed on probation, in the discretion of the\ncommissioner, for a period of no more than one year. Such probation may include\nadditional monitoring, inspections, limitations on enrollment, teaching out\nsome or all of a school's present students, or temporary cessation of\ninstruction. (i) A school placed on probation\nshall submit reports on its financial condition as directed by the\ncommissioner. Such report shall be on a form and shall include content\nprescribed by the commissioner and shall be reviewed by the commissioner to\ndetermine the school's financial viability. The commissioner may require that\nthis report be completed by an independent auditor. (ii)\n\nDuring the probationary period, the\nschool and the department shall make efforts to resolve the problems at the\nschool, through the school's demonstration of alternative methods of financial\nviability acceptable to the commissioner. Alternative methods of demonstrating\nfinancial viability may include: (a) the\nschool securing a performance bond payable to the department, in a form and\nmanner determined by the commissioner, and in an amount appropriate to\neliminate any liability to the tuition reimbursement account should the school\ncease operation; (b) the school\nlimiting its collection of tuition funds until each student completes their\nprogram of study; (c) establishing\na trust account for the sole and exclusive benefit of students, pursuant to\nsection\n5008\nof the\n\nEducation Law; or, (d) any other\nmeans acceptable to the commissioner. (iii)\n\nBy the conclusion of the probationary\nperiod, the school must satisfactorily demonstrate to the commissioner that it\nis financially viable by meeting one or more alternative methods of\ndemonstrating financial viability set forth in this subdivision, or the general\nstandards set forth in subdivision (a) of this section. If the school cannot\ndemonstrate to the commissioner that it is financially viable by one or more\nmethods set forth in this subparagraph, and if the commissioner determines that\nthe school's financial condition continues to threaten its ability to educate\nstudents and/or jeopardize student tuition funds, the commissioner shall\nschedule a hearing pursuant to subdivisions (2) and (3) of section\n5003\nof the\n\nEducation law, to consider suspension or revocation the school's\nlicense. (3)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may require applicants for initial licensure or certification that\nare newly formed and that have not completed any fiscal years from which to\ndetermine a composite score to establish a performance bond, trust account, or\nother means acceptable to the commissioner as an alternative to the requirement\nset forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that the applicant\nmeets the standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this\nsection. (d) Administrative actions. The commissioner may deny, suspend, revoke or decline\nto renew any license or certification if the commissioner determines that a\nschool's financial condition may result in the interruption or cessation of\ninstruction or jeopardize student tuition funds pursuant to section\n5001\n(5)(c)(3)\nof the Education Law. (e) Financial Reporting. (1)\n\nApplicants for initial licensure or\ncertification shall provide the following financial reports, as applicable, to\nthe commissioner: (i) a balance sheet of the\ncorporate entity or partnership with a certification of accuracy signed by the\nindividual shareholders of the corporation or partners, and dated not more than\n30 days prior to the date of the license application; (ii)\na certificate of incorporation for a\ncorporate entity, or a partnership agreement for a partnership; (iii)\na statement indicating the location and\ntype of all bank accounts held by the corporate owners or partners in their\nofficial capacities; (iv)\naudited\nfinancial statements for the previous two fiscal years. (v) a projected operating budget, including\nall projected expenses, revenues, profits and losses, by month, for two\nconsecutive 12-month periods (the first two projected years) for initial\nlicensure; and\n(vi)\nsuch other\ninformation as the commissioner may require regarding the adequacy of the\napplicant's resources beyond all indebtedness available for educational\npurposes and to ensure the capability of the prospective school to meet its\nfinancial obligations. (2)\n\nApplicants for renewal of licensure or\ncertification shall submit audited financial statements in accordance with\nsection\n5001\n(4)(a)\nof the Education Law. The annual\nfinancial statements submitted pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision\nshall satisfy this submission requirement, provided that for schools described\nin subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the annual financial\nstatement submitted immediately prior to the due date of the renewal\napplication is an audited financial statement. (3)\n\nAll schools shall submit annual financial\nstatements in accordance with the following provisions: (i) Any school that received five hundred\nthousand dollars or more in gross tuition in a school fiscal year shall be\nrequired to submit to the commissioner an annual audited financial statement\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for that\nfiscal year. In addition, any school that has a gross tuition of less than five\nhundred thousand dollars in a school fiscal year but whose combined state and\nfederal student financial aid in such year equals one hundred thousand dollars\nor more shall also submit an annual audited financial statement to the\ncommissioner for that fiscal year. (ii)\n\nSchools whose gross tuition is less than\nfive hundred thousand dollars in a School fiscal year and which receive less\nthan one hundred thousand dollars in state and federal student financial aid in\na school fiscal year shall file with the commissioner an unaudited financial\nstatement in a format prescribed by the commissioner, provided, however, that\nany such school shall file an audited financial statement the fiscal year after\na reviewed financial statement is submitted. For such schools, audited\nfinancial statements are required every two years, at minimum, with reviewed\nfinancial statements allowed during the alternate year. Upon a determination by\nthe commissioner that a school has submitted false or inaccurate statements or\nthat a significant, unsubstantiated decline in gross tuition has occurred, the\ncommissioner may require any such school to file an audited financial statement\npursuant to this paragraph even during alternate years when reviewed statements\nwould ordinarily be allowed. (iii)\nannual financial statements shall be due no later than 120 days from the end of\nthe school's fiscal year. The commissioner may extend this deadline for up to\n60 days for good cause shown, as determined by the commissioner. (iv)\nannual financial statements shall\ninclude the following data, disaggregated by each licensed location: (a) the gross tuition income for all approved\noccupational curricula and non-occupational courses; and\n(b) an itemized account of tuition refunds\ndue and owing to past or presently enrolled students, separated out for each\nlicensed or certified location.
