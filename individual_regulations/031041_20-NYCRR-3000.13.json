  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 3000.13 - Small claims hearings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. A petitioner who wishes to have the proceedings in his or her case\nconducted in the small claims unit may so elect at the time of the filing of\nthe petition, if the amount in controversy meets the criteria contained in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. The small claims hearing will be an adversary\nproceeding conducted by an impartial presiding officer. The presiding officer\nwill know nothing of the controversy prior to the hearing and shall conduct the\nhearing (see subdivision [f] of this section) in a fair manner so as to permit\nthe parties to offer all relevant evidence to establish their positions. Where\ncertain points or issues are unclear, the presiding officer may ask questions\nof the parties or of witnesses for the purpose of clarifying the\nrecord. (b) Criteria for small\nclaims. Controversies which may be heard by the small claims unit are\nrestricted in amount to $20,000 (not including penalty and interest) for any\n12-month period in question. However, with respect to cases arising out of\nsales and compensating use taxes pursuant to articles 28 and 29 of the Tax Law, the amount in controversy may not exceed $40,000 (not including penalty and\ninterest) for each 12-month period. (c) Pleadings; applicable sections; notice. (1)\n\nThe only pleadings to be served by the\nparties are a petition by the petitioner (see section\n3000.3\nof this Part) and an answer by the office of counsel (see section\n3000.4\n[b]\nof this Part). (2)\n\nThe parties may\nfile briefs, additional documents or other material in support of their\npleadings. (3)\n\nThe provisions of\nsection\n3000.4\n(d) of this Part, regarding amended pleadings, are applicable to this section. The\nprovisions of sections\n3000.5, 3000.6\nand\n3000.9\nof this Part are not applicable to this section. (4)\n\nAfter the petition and answer have been\nserved, or the time for serving an answer has expired, the controversy shall be\nat issue and the small claims unit shall schedule the controversy for a small\nclaims hearing. The parties shall be given at least 30 days' notice of the\nfirst hearing date, and at least 10 days' notice of any adjourned or continued\nhearing date. A request by any party for a preference in scheduling will be\nhonored to the extent possible. (d) Adjournment; default. (1)\n\nAt the written request of either party, made on notice to the other party and received 15 days in advance of the\nscheduled hearing date, an adjournment may be granted where good cause is\nshown. In the event of an emergency, an adjournment may be granted on less\nnotice. Upon continued and unwarranted delay of the proceedings by either\nparty, the presiding officer shall render a default determination against the\ndilatory party. (2)\n\nIn the event a\nparty or the party's representative does not appear at a scheduled hearing and\nan adjournment has not been granted, the presiding officer shall, on his or her\nown motion or on the motion of the other party, render a default determination\nagainst the party failing to appear. (3)\n\nUpon written application to the\nsupervising administrative law judge, a default determination may be vacated\nwhere the party shows an excuse for the default and a meritorious\ncase. (e) Presiding\nofficer. The small claims hearing shall be conducted by a presiding officer\nwith the same authorization provided an administrative law judge conducting a\nhearing by section\n3000.15\n(c) of this Part. (f) Conduct of\nhearing. (1)\n\nThe small claims hearing shall\nbe conducted by a presiding officer in such a manner as to do substantial\njustice between the parties according to the rules of substantive and\nadministrative law. The hearing shall be conducted as informally as possible, consistent with orderly procedure. Any evidence which the presiding officer\nconsiders necessary or desirable for a just and equitable determination will be\nreceived, except that effect shall be given to the rules of privilege\nrecognized by law. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner, except as\notherwise provided by law. (2)\n\nThe\nprovisions contained in section\n3000.15\n(d)(1)-(6)\nof this Part, regarding conduct of a hearing, are applicable to a small claims\nhearing; however, such applicability is not intended to alter the informal\nnature of the small claims hearing. (3)\n\nThe small claims hearing will be\nstenographically reported or otherwise recorded, but a transcript thereof need\nnot be made unless the presiding officer otherwise directs. Where a transcript\nis made, it shall be available for examination at the offices of the Division\nof Tax Appeals in Albany, or may be purchased pursuant to section\n3000.19\nof this\n\nPart. (g) Transfer to\nadministrative law judge. At any time before the conclusion of a small claims\nhearing, the petitioner may, by written notice to the secretary, discontinue\nsuch small claims proceeding and request that the hearing on the petition be\ntransferred to and conducted by an administrative law judge. Such\ndiscontinuance will be without prejudice to any subsequent proceeding before an\nadministrative law judge. (h) Determination. (1)\n\nIssuance of determination. After the small claims hearing, the presiding officer shall review the evidence\nand render a determination which will contain findings of fact and conclusions\nof law. The presiding officer will render a determination within three months\nafter completion of the hearing or the submission of briefs, whichever is\nlater. The Division of Tax Appeals will serve a copy of the determination on\nthe petitioner, the petitioner's representative and the office of\ncounsel. (2)\n\nEffect of\ndetermination. The final determination of the presiding officer shall be\nconclusive upon all parties and shall not be subject to review by any other\nunit in the Division of Tax Appeals or by the tribunal. However, on the motion\nof either party, the tribunal may order a rehearing upon proof or allegation of\nmisconduct by the presiding officer. Determinations of presiding officers are\nnot considered precedent, nor are they given any force or effect in other\nproceedings in the Division of Tax Appeals. (i) Assignment of another presiding officer. Whenever a presiding officer is disqualified or it becomes impractical for him\nor her to continue the hearing, another presiding officer may be assigned to\ncontinue with the case, unless it is shown that substantial prejudice to a\nparty will result therefrom.
