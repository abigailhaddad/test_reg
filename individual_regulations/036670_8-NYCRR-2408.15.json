  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2408.15 - In-state study\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To be\nconsidered in attendance at an educational institution, a student must either\nbe matriculated at that educational institution, or must be registered at that\neducational institution under permit from another educational institution at\nwhich the student is regularly matriculated. A student who is regularly\nmatriculated at an out-of-state school and who attends an educational\ninstitution without full transfer and matriculation shall be considered as an\nout-of-state student. (b) Instruction received by a student outside New York State may be considered as\ninstruction conducted by an educational institution in this State, within the\nintent of the law, only if the student is required to pay all tuition and\ninstructional fees for such foreign or out-of-state study to the approved\neducational institution. To be approved, an off-campus study program must be an\nintegral part of the curriculum of the educational institution, and tuition\nmust be payable to and received by the educational institution in the same\nmanner as tuition charged for any other educational institution program. If the\nstudent pays tuition or educational fees to an out-of-state institution, the\nstudent shall be considered as receiving instruction provided by that\ninstitution, notwithstanding the fact that the student may be maintaining\nregistration in an educational institution, or that the educational institution\nmay also be charging the student a fee for supervisory, guidance, or\nadministrative services. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the corporation may establish\nadditional standards for the approval of foreign and out-of-state study\nprograms in order for students to qualify for awards under this Chapter. An\neducational institution must receive approval of its foreign or out-of-state\nstudy program from the corporation prior to certifying any student enrolled in\nsuch programs for an award.
