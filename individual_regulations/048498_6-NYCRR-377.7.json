  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 377.7 - Facility siting criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The board in making its determination to grant, conditionally or otherwise, or to deny a certificate shall consider the\ncriteria listed in subdivision (b) of this section. The specific criteria set\nforth in subdivision (b) of this section each relate three distinct situations\nrelative to such criteria. Situation (1) is considered to be the most favorable\nwith respect to siting requirements, situation (2) is considered less favorable\nand situation (3) is considered least favorable. (b) Criteria. (1)\n\nPopulation density in the vicinity of the\nproposed site. (i) General considerations. The\nboard shall focus its inquiry on the current population density in areas\nadjacent to the proposed site and on population projections for such areas. Population density within 0.5 mile of the proposed site boundary shall be the\nprime consideration unless specific conditions unique to a particular site\ndictate otherwise. The population density range examples included below are\nappropriate for a major high technology hazardous waste management facility\nutilizing a comprehensive arrangement of storage, treatment and disposal\ntechnologies such as recycling, incineration, detoxification and\nsolidification/land burial. This hypothetical facility would have an\napproximate annual treatment capacity of 25 million gallons or more of\nhazardous wastes and would represent a situation where potentially significant\nimpacts have been identified which may adversely affect populations immediately\nadjacent to the site boundary. On the other hand, considerably greater\npopulation density ranges would be appropriate for the most favorable, less\nfavorable and least favorable situations in the case of another hypothetical\nhazardous waste management facility which is to handle substantially smaller\nvolumes of wastes, and as a result of the nature of the facility, its operation\nwould pose a relatively small potential hazard to adjacent\npopulations. (ii)\n\nSpecific\ncriteria. (a) The residential and\nnonresidential population within 0.5 mile of the site boundary. (1)\n\nThe population density is very low\n(\ne.g., less than 150 persons per square mile). (2)\n\nThe population density is moderate\n(\ne.g., in a range of 150 - 400 persons per square\nmile). (3)\n\nThe population density\nis high (\ne.g., greater than 400 persons per square mile). (b) The projected\npopulation and the rate of growth for the area within 0.5 mile of the site\nboundary during the 20-year period following initial site operation. (1)\n\nThe population is not expected to\nincrease. (2)\n\nThe population is\nexpected to increase above current levels at a rate less than the rate\nforecasted for the county in which the site is located. (3)\n\nThe population is expected to increase\nabove current levels at a rate greater than the rate forecasted for the county\nin which the site is located. (2)\n\nPopulation adjacent to transport route. (i) General considerations. The board shall\nconsider the population within 0.5 mile of the transport route, defined as the\nroute(s) between the site entrance and the interstate/limited access highway\ninterchange(s), which is to be used by site-bound motor vehicles to deliver\nwastes to the site. The paramount concern is the extent to which an accident\noccurring in transit will result in exposure and injury to the populations\nalong the routes. The population range examples included below are appropriate\nfor the transport routes providing access to the entrance of a major high\ntechnology hazardous waste management facility utilizing a comprehensive\narrangement of storage, treatment and disposal technologies such as recycling, incineration, detoxification and solidification/land burial. The hypothetical\nfacility would have an approximate annual treatment capacity of 25 million\ngallons or more of hazardous wastes and would represent a situation where\npotentially significant impacts have been identified which may adversely affect\npopulations immediately adjacent to the site boundary and the transport routes. On the other hand, considerably greater population ranges would be appropriate\nfor the most favorable, less favorable and least favorable situations in the\ncase of another hypothetical facility which is to receive substantially smaller\nvolumes of wastes, and as a result of the nature and volume of the wastes\nprocessed by the facility, the delivery of such wastes would pose a relatively\nsmall potential hazard to populations adjacent to the transport\nroute(s). (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) The residential and nonresidential\npopulation for areas within 0.5 mile of the anticipated transport routes. (1)\n\nThe population is low\n(\ne.g., less than 500 persons). (2)\n\nThe population is moderate\n(\ne.g., in a range of 500 -1,500 persons). (3)\n\nThe population is high\n(\ne.g., greater than 1,500 persons). (b) The projected population and the rate of\ngrowth for areas within 0.5 mile of the transport routes during the 20-year\nperiod following initial site operation. (1)\n\nThe population is not expected to increase. (2)\n\nThe population is expected to increase\nabove current levels at a rate less than the rate forecasted for the county in\nwhich the site is located. (3)\n\nThe\npopulation is expected to increase above current levels at a rate greater than\nthe rate forecasted for the county in which the site is located. (3)\n\nRisk of\naccident in transportation. (i) General\nconsiderations. The board shall evaluate the risk associated with the\ntransportation of hazardous wastes to the proposed site. Accident risk is a\nfunction of the probability of an accident and the consequences of an accident, should one occur. The transport route(s) between the site entrance and the\ninterstate/limited access highway interchange(s) over which the wastes will be\ndelivered to the site shall be considered by the board. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Mode of transportation. (1)\n\nThe transportation mode(s) used are those\nwhich have a low associated accident rate. (2)\n\nThe transportation mode(s) used would\nhave a somewhat higher accident rate associated with their\nutilization. (3)\n\nThe transportation\nmode(s) used has the highest rate of accidents. (b) Length of transport route. (1)\n\nThe wastes will be transported only a\nshort distance to the site (less than 5 miles). (2)\n\nThe wastes will be transported a moderate\ndistance to the site (a range of 5-15 miles). (3)\n\nThe wastes will be transported a\nsubstantial distance to the site (greater than 15 miles). (c) Accident rate of transport route. (1)\n\nWhere motor vehicles are employed, the\ntransport route is characterized by a low accident rate. (2)\n\nWhere motor vehicles are employed, the\ntransport route has a somewhat higher accident rate. (3)\n\nWhere motor vehicles are employed, the\ntransport route has a very high accident rate. (d) Structures within 0.5 mile of the\ntransportation route. (1)\n\nThere are less than\n50 residences, and no schools or hospitals within 0.5 mile of the\ntransportation route. (2)\n\nThere are\nbetween 50 and 150 residences, and no schools or hospitals. (3)\n\nThere are more than 150 residences and\none or more schools or hospitals. (e) Transportation restrictions (traffic\nintersections, traffic/railroad intersections, tunnels, bridges, and toll\nbooths). (1)\n\nThe number of restrictions per\nmile is less than four. (2)\n\nThe\nnumber of restrictions per mile is between four and eight. (3)\n\nThe number of restrictions per mile is\ngreater than eight. (f) Nature and volume of waste being transported. (1)\n\nThe nature and volume of the waste being\ntransported to the site would pose no potential adverse environmental or health\neffects in the event of an accident. (2)\n\nThe nature and volume of the waste being\ntransported to the site would pose an insignificant potential for adverse\nenvironmental or health effects in the event of an accident. (3)\n\nThe nature and volume of the waste being\ntransported to the site would pose a significant potential for adverse\nenvironmental or health effects in the event of an accident. (4)\n\nProximity to incompatible structures. (i) General considerations. The linear distance from the site boundary to\nincompatible structures must be considered (\ne.g., residence, airport, school, hospital, church, commercial centers, nursing home). Acceptable buffer zones separating residences and certain other types of\nsensitive populated structures from the types of operations conducted at\nhazardous waste sites are needed. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Proximity to airports. (1)\n\nThere are no airport runways within two\nmiles of a site. (2)\n\nThere are\nairport runways used by turbojets and piston type aircraft located between one\nand two miles of a site. (3)\n\nThere\nare airport runways used by turbojets and piston type aircraft located between\n0.5 and 1 mile of a site. (b) Proximity to other incompatible\nstructures. (1)\n\nThere are no residences, schools, hospitals, churches, commercial centers, nursing homes or other\nsensitive populated structures within 0.5 mile of the site boundary. (2)\n\nThere is one or more residences, schools, hospitals, churches, commercial centers, nursing homes or other sensitive\npopulated structures within 0.25 mile to 0.5 mile of the site\nboundary. (3)\n\nThere is one or more\nresidences, schools, hospitals, churches, commercial centers, nursing homes or\nother sensitive populated structures within 0.25 mile of the site\nboundary. (5)\n\nUtility lines. (i) General considerations. The location of a\nproposed site shall take into account existing or proposed major utility lines. This is to insure that the generation, transportation, treatment, storage or\ndisposal of hazardous wastes at, near or about such a site will not interfere\nwith, cause damage to, or otherwise disrupt the operation of major utility\nlines. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Proximity to major utility lines. (1)\n\nThere are no such utility lines in the\nvicinity of the site. (2)\n\nThere is\nat least one such utility line in the vicinity of the site but relocation is\nnot necessary. (3)\n\nRelocation of\none or more such utility lines is necessary. (6)\n\nMunicipal effects. (i) General considerations. The site shall be\nconsidered for consistency with the intent of the municipal master land use\nplan, and with local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations which have not\nbeen adopted pursuant to a master land use plan. It is important to insure that\nthe construction and operation of the proposed facility will not adversely\nimpact on planning schemes developed by the municipalities in which they are\nlocated. Further, the short- and long-term financial effects of the addition of\nthe proposed facility to the municipality shall be considered. Both the\nincreased tax revenues and the added burden of providing services to the\nfacility are important factors. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Consistency with the intent of master\nland use plan. (1)\n\nThe siting of the proposed\nfacility is consistent with the specific intent and overall approach of the\nmaster land use plan. (2)\n\nThe\nsiting of the proposed facility is generally consistent with the specific\nintent and overall approach of the master land use plan, although some\ninconsistencies are present. (3)\n\nThe siting of the proposed facility has major inconsistencies with the specific\nintent and overall approach of the master land use plan. (b) Consistency with local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. (1)\n\nThe siting of the\nproposed facility is consistent with those local laws, ordinances, rules and\nregulations which have not been adopted pursuant to a master land use\nplan. (2)\n\nThe siting of the\nproposed facility is generally consistent with those local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations which have not been adopted pursuant to a master land use\nplan, though some inconsistencies are present. (3)\n\nThe siting of the proposed facility has\nmajor inconsistencies with those local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations\nwhich have not been adopted pursuant to a master land use plan. (c) Public expense/revenue\ntradeoffs. (1)\n\nPublic revenues associated with\nthe facility would far exceed the public expenses that are likely to be\nincurred over the short- and long-term (\ni.e., first 20 years\nof operation). (2)\n\nPublic revenues\nassociated with the facility would only marginally exceed the public expenses\nthat are likely to be incurred over the short- and long-term\n(\ni.e., first 20 years of operation). (3)\n\nPublic expenses associated with the\nproposed facility would be greater than the public revenues that are expected\nto accrue over the short-and long-term (\ni.e., first 20 years\nof operation). (7)\n\nContamination of ground and surface\nwaters. (i) General considerations. The board\nshall consider the potential for groundwater and surface water contamination as\nthe result of the construction and operation of the site. Both onsite and\noff-site effects and proposed methods to mitigate any adverse effects relating\nto the contamination of all ground and surface waters shall be\nanalyzed. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Ground and surface water aspects\n(1)\n\nThe site is optimally located. It is not\nin hydraulic contact with and no contamination problems are anticipated with\nrespect to: -floodplains\n-wetlands\n-recharge zones\n-surface waters\n-aquifers\n(2)\n\nThe site is less than optimally located\nand is in hydraulic contact with one or more of the following factors: -floodplains\n-wetlands\n-recharge zones\n-surface waters\n-aquifers\n\nHowever, it is anticipated that these locational\nlimitations can be overcome without extensive effort. (3)\n\nThe site's locational characteristics\nassociated with: -floodplains\n-wetlands\n-recharge zones\n-surface waters\n-aquifers, present severe problems with respect to water\ncontamination. Extensive efforts would be required to overcome these natural\nconditions. (b) Runoff. (1)\n\nThe natural topography associated\nwith the site is advantageous; it will inhibit surface water runoff from\nentering and leaving the active site. (2)\n\nThe natural topography associated with\nthe site may not prevent surface water runoff from entering and leaving the\nsite's active area; therefore, some site modification may be\nnecessary. (3)\n\nThe natural\ntopography associated with the site will encourage surface water runoff to\nenter and leave the active site area; extensive site modifications will be\nnecessary to overcome these natural conditions. (c) Hydrogeological characteristics. (1)\n\nNatural soil conditions at the site are\noptimal; the soil characteristics would impede any groundwater\ncontamination. (2)\n\nSubsurface\nconditions at the site do not present any major problems with respect to\ngroundwater contamination; however, site modifications may be required to\nfurther reduce the risk of groundwater contamination. (3)\n\nSubsurface conditions at the site are not\ndesirable; extensive site modifications would be required to reduce the risk of\ngroundwater contamination. (8)\n\nWater supply sources. (i) General consideration. The board shall\nconsider all aspects of the facility's impact on sources of water supply for\nhuman and animal consumption. The board shall take into account the effect that\nthe facility will have on surface water or aquifers located on and in the\nvicinity of the site which are used for domestic, agricultural or industrial\npurposes. The location of boundaries of water supply watersheds both public and\nprivate are of prime importance. The board shall consider the current use and\npotential uses for such bodies of water and the extent to which the facility\nwill create condtions inconsistent with those uses. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Relationship to water supply sources. (1)\n\nThe proposed site is located favorably. It is not in close proximity to: -public or private drinking water supplies or livestock\nwater supplies. -public or private bodies of recreational water. -agricultural, commercial or industrial water\nsupplies. Therefore, no potential problems are\nanticipated. (2)\n\nThe\nproposed site is in an acceptable location. It is located within close\nproximity to: -public or private drinking water supplies or livestock\nwater supplies. -public or private bodies of recreational water. -agricultural, commercial or industrial water\nsupplies. However, mitigative measures will be used to protect water\nsupply sources. (3)\n\nThe\nproposed site is in an unfavorable location. It is located within close\nproximity to: -public or private drinking water supplies or livestock\nwater supplies. -public or private bodies of recreational water. -agricultural, commercial or industrial water\nsupplies. Although mitigative measures are expected to be employed, they may not be sufficient to insure the protection of water supply\nsources. (9)\n\nFire and explosions. (i) General considerations. Due to the nature\nof the wastes, special consideration must be given by the board to the\npotential for fires and explosions at the site. Because of the inherent quality\nof the wastes, the chief focus shall be on proposed safety measures and\nemergency response techniques. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Minimum distances. (1)\n\nDistances from the site to residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, public highways, railroads, etc. are\nsubstantially greater than minimums established in the\n\nAmerican Table\nof Distances for Storage of Explosives, by the Institute of Makers of\n\nExplosives (\nq.v. ), 420 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017, May 1983. The above document is available for inspection and copying in Rm. 209\nof the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation offices at 625\n\nBroadway, Albany, NY 12233, or can be directly obtained from the sources listed\nfor the given reference. (2)\n\nDistances from the site to residential, commercial, and industrial buildings, public highways, railroads, etc., meet minimums established in the\nabove-mentioned table. (3)\n\nThe site\nis less than the minimum established distances mentioned above, or the\napplicant has not considered appropriate minimum distances. (b) Fire departments and emergency\nmedical services. (1)\n\nThe site is in an area\nserviced by organized, fully manned, 24-hour fire departments and emergency\nmedical teams. (2)\n\nThe site is in\nan area serviced by organized voluntary fire departments and emergency medical\nteams. (3)\n\nThe area in which the\nsite is located is not served by a fire department or emergency medical\nteam. (c) Proximity to\nfire department and firefighting water supply. A suitable water supply shall be\nas recommended by the New York State Department of State Office of Fire\n\nPrevention and Control. (1)\n\nThe site is\nrelatively close (\ne.g., within three miles) to the fire\ndepartment, or onsite firefighting capability exists to allow for a rapid\nresponse, and to a suitable water supply. (2)\n\nThe site is farther away\n(\ne.g., three to five miles) from the fire department's\nlocation and from a suitable water supply. (3)\n\nThe site is farther away\n(\ne.g., more than five miles) from the fire department's\nlocation and from a suitable water supply. (10)\n\nAir quality. (i) General considerations. Siting of a\nfacility must take into account air quality problems which may result from the\noperation of the facility or accidental fires and explosions which may occur. The board shall consider potential air quality problems which may occur as the\nresult of historical or estimated meteorological conditions and to what extent\nsuch respective problems and conditions will affect neighboring\ncommunities. (ii)\n\nSpecific\ncriteria. (a) Atmospheric stability. A site\nmust be evaluated on the basis of the frequency of occurrence of stable\natmospheric conditions which are conducive to the development of high pollution\nlevels. (1)\n\nAreas in which atmospheric\nconditions are historically \"unstable\" are most acceptable. (2)\n\nAreas in which atmospheric conditions are\nhistorically \"neutral\" or \"less stable\" are less acceptable. (3)\n\nAreas in which atmospheric conditions are\nhistorically \"stable\" are least acceptable. (b) Prevailing wind direction. The population\nexposure to air pollution in the vicinity of a site will depend upon the\nfrequency distribution of wind directions for the area. These may be determined\nfrom representative historical data for the area or estimated on the basis of\ngeneral meteorological principles. (1)\n\nAreas\nlocated downwind from populated areas are most acceptable. (2)\n\nAreas located perpendicular to populated\nareas, relative to prevailing winds, are less acceptable. (3)\n\nAreas located upwind from populated areas\nare the least acceptable. (c) Wind speed. Concentrations of air\npollutants emitted from ground level sources are inversely proportional to the\nwind speed. Hence, the frequency distribution of wind speeds in a site area\nindicates the potential for high concentrations of pollutants. (1)\n\nAreas most likely to be associated with\nhigher wind speeds are most acceptable. (2)\n\nAreas in which wind speeds are\npredominantly moderate are less acceptable. (3)\n\nAreas of low wind speed are least\nacceptable. (11)\n\nAreas of mineral exploitation. (i) General considerations. Areas of concern\nare those where mineral resources of solid or liquid form have been removed by\nvarious procedures. Such areas commonly present limitations to land disposal\nfacilities due to excavation close to or into groundwater, avenues of rapid\ntransmittal of contaminants should leakage or spillage occur through boreholes\nor improperly or uncased wells, and structural instability and possibility of\nsubsidence due to extensive subsurface removal of mineral resources. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Risk of subsidence. (1)\n\nAreas in which mineral exploitation has\nnot involved subsurface removal are most acceptable. (2)\n\nAreas in which mineral exploitation has\ninvolved some subsurface removal are less acceptable. (3)\n\nAreas in which mineral exploitation has\ninvolved substantial subsurface removal are least acceptable. (12)\n\nPreservation of endangered, threatened, and indigenous species. (i) General considerations. The board shall\nfocus on adverse impacts of the facility on endangered, threatened, and\nindigenous species or critical habitat for wildlife generally and the extent to\nwhich mitigation measures can be effectively implemented. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Developmental and operational impacts on\nendangered, threatened, and indigenous species or critical habitat. (1)\n\nSites are most acceptable where the\ndevelopment and operation of proposed facilities is not expected to jeopardize\nthe continued existence of endangered, threatened, and indigenous species by\ndestruction or adverse modification of their habitat. (2)\n\nSites are less acceptable where the\ndevelopment and operation of proposed facilities could possibly jeopardize the\ncontinued existence of endangered, threatened, and indigenous species by\ndestruction or adverse modification of their habitat, but where effective\nmitigative measures are expected to be used. (3)\n\nSites are least acceptable where the\ndevelopment and operation of proposed facilities is likely to jeopardize the\ncontinued existence of endangered, threatened, and indigenous species by\ndestruction or adverse modification of their habitat, and where mitigative\nmeasures are either ineffective or not expected to be used. (13)\n\nConservation of historic and cultural resources. (i) General considerations. The construction\nand operation of the facility may affect the preservation of historic and\ncultural resources. The extent to which these resources will be disturbed\nand/or lost and measures to mitigate adverse effects shall be considered by the\nboard. The board shall also consider the facility's impact on the public's\naccess to nearby historic and cultural resources and any negative impact on the\nvisitation to these resources. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Proximity to\nhistorical or cultural resources. (1)\n\nSites\nare most acceptable where the development and operation of proposed facilities\nis not expected to adversely affect the preservation or use of significant\nhistoric and cultural resources. (2)\n\nSites are less acceptable where the\ndevelopment and operation of proposed facilities could possibly, wholly or\npartially, adversely affect the preservation or use of significant historic and\ncultural resources, but where effective mitigative measures are expected to be\nused. (3)\n\nSites are least\nacceptable where the development and operation of proposed facilities is likely\nto adversely affect the preservation or use of significant historic and\ncultural resources, and where mitigative measures are expected to be either\nineffective or not used. (14)\n\nOpen space, recreational, and visual\nimpacts. (i) General considerations. The\nboard shall consider the extent to which the facility will diminish available\nopen space and recreational resources used by the surrounding communities and\nthe visual aesthetic impact of the facility and its proximity to areas that are\nmuch traveled by the general public. The board shall consider both actual and\nconstructive deprivation of the use of these resources. Proposed mitigation\nmeasures should be considered as well. (ii)\n\nSpecific criteria. (a) Proximity to open space and recreational\nresources. (1)\n\nSites are most acceptable where\nthe development and operation of proposed facilities are not expected to\nadversely affect the presence or use of existing or proposed open space and\nrecreation resources. (2)\n\nSites are\nless acceptable where the development and operation of proposed facilities\ncould possibly affect the presence or use of existing or proposed open space\nand recreation resources, but where effective mitigative measures are expected\nto be used. (3)\n\nSites are least\nacceptable where the development and operation of proposed facilities are\nlikely to remove or adversely affect the use of existing open space and\nrecreation resources, and where mitigative measures are expected to be\nineffective or are not expected to be used. (b) Relationship to scenic views or vistas. (1)\n\nSites are most acceptable where the\ndevelopment and operation of proposed facilities do not adversely affect the\nview of scenic points, vistas, and other elements that are visually pleasing. Overall, the quality of the visual scene is either improved or\nmaintained. (2)\n\nSites are less\nacceptable where the development and operation of proposed facilities partially\neliminate or obstruct the view of scenic points, vistas, and other elements\nthat are visually pleasing. Overall, the quality of the visual scene is\nsomewhat limited. (3)\n\nSites are\nleast acceptable where the development and operation of proposed facilities\nwholly eliminate or obstruct the view of scenic points, vistas, and other\nelements that are visually pleasing. Overall, the quality of the visual scene\nis severely diminished. (c) Degree to which proposed facilities are\nreadily noticeable to passers-by. (1)\n\nSites\nare most acceptable where proposed facilities are not readily noticeable to\npassers-by. (2)\n\nSites are less\nacceptable where proposed facilities could be readily noticeable to passers-by, but where visual barriers or cover are expected to be used. (3)\n\nSites are least acceptable where proposed\nfacilities are readily noticeable to passers-by, and where visual barriers or\ncover are not expected to be used or are not expected to be\neffective. (c) Application of the criteria. (1)\n\nThe board shall make determinations\nrelating to the specific criteria. The board shall insure that its conclusions\nare consistent with the intent as expressed in the general considerations\nassociated with each siting consideration. (2)\n\nThe tables following this section\nrepresent guidelines for evaluating the relative importance of each criterion. The board may alter the weight given to any or all of the criteria depending\nupon specific circumstances unique to the proposed site. The board shall\nreallocate weights among remaining criteria should one or more criteria not be\napplicable to a specific site, such that the sum of the average weights for the\nremainder of the criteria equals 100. The board shall determine the importance\nassigned to each criterion and signify the same in its report. (3)\n\nThe relative desirability of a proposed\nfacility shall be determined by the board by applying its conclusions to the\nsiting criteria to the tables following this section in the manner set forth in\n\nAppendix 17, infra. Based on the tables, the numerical value\nwhich the board determines represents the relative desirability of the proposed\nfacility shall determine whether the siting criteria have been satisfied. Facilities which score 200 or above do not meet the siting criteria. Facilities\nwhich score below 200 are adequately sited but may require the imposition of\nspecial conditions under the certificate. (4)\n\nNothing herein shall limit the authority\nof the board to deny an application if residential areas and contiguous\npopulations will be endangered, if construction or operation of such facility\nwould be contrary to local zoning or land use regulations in force on the date\nof the application or the board finds that the facility is not necessary or is\notherwise not in the public interest.
