Tit. 16 § 661.3 - Accounts-general\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As a general\nrule, all accounts kept by reporting companies shall conform in numbers and\ntitles to those prescribed herein. However, reporting companies may use\ndifferent numbers for internal purposes when separate accounts (or subaccounts)\nmaintained are consistent with the title and content of accounts and\nsubaccounts prescribed in this system. (1)\n\nAccounts which are clearly summaries of other accounts or subaccounts are to be\nused for reporting purposes and are not otherwise required to be\nmaintained. (2)\nA company may\nsubdivide any of the accounts prescribed. The titles of all such subaccounts\nshall refer by number or title to the controlling account. (3)\nA telephone company may only use its own\nsubaccount structure where this structure can readily be mapped to the\nsubaccount structure prescribed in this system of accounts. Any company that\nwishes to use its own subaccount structure shall file its proposed structure\nwith the director of the Office of Accounting and Finance, or his designee, no\nless than 60 days before the intended adoption of such accounting practice. Before such accounting practice may be adopted the director must be satisfied\nthat the proposed subaccount structure can be mapped to the subaccount\nstructure prescribed in this system of accounts. (4)\nA company may establish temporary or\nexperimental accounts provided that within 30 days of the opening of such\naccounts the company notifies the commission of the nature and purpose\nthereof.

(c) As of\nthe date a company becomes subject to this system of accounts, it shall prepare\nopening entries in accordance with the following provisions: (1)\n\nThe accounts prescribed herein shall be\nopened by transferring thereto the balances carried in the accounts previously\nmaintained. The company is authorized to make such subdivisions, reclassifications, or consolidations of such balances as are necessary to meet\nthe requirements of this system of accounts. (2)\n\nThe company shall prepare and keep as\nsupporting records summary statements showing: (i) the closing balances in each account\ncarried on the books prior to the adoption of this system of\naccounts; (ii)\nthe journal entries\nto effect the transfer of those balances to the accounts prescribed herein, arranging such entries so as to show for each account or subdivision thereof\nfrom what account and to what account each amount was transferred; (iii)\nthe resultant opening balance of each\naccount under this system of accounts. (3)\n\nThe first annual report filed with this\ncommission by a utility covering its operations subsequent to the adoption of\nthis system of accounts shall include copies of the statements referred to in\nsubdivision (c)(2) of this section and shall be accompanied by a statement of\nthe company's independent auditors attesting to the conformity, in all material\naspects, of the transfer of the balance sheet account balances and detail\ntelecommunications plant accounts as required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this\nsection with this system of accounts. (d) Nothing contained in this Part shall\nprohibit or excuse any company, receiver, or operating trustee of any carrier\nfrom subdividing the accounts hereby prescribed for the purpose of: (1)\ncomplying with the requirements of the\ncommission(s) having jurisdiction; or\n(2)\nsecuring the information required in the\nprescribed reports to such commission(s). (e) Where the use of subsidiary records is\nconsidered necessary in order to secure the information required in reports to\nthe commission, the company shall incorporate the following controls into their\naccounting system with respect to such subsidiary records: (1)\n\nSubsidiary records shall be reconciled to\nthe company's general ledger or books of original entry, as\nappropriate. (2)\n\nThe company shall\nadequately document the accounting procedures related to subsidiary\nrecords.
