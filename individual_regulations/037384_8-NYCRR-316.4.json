  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 316.4 - Contracting and purchasing materials, supplies, equipment, services and construction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) New York State Contract Reporter. (1)\n\nContracts up to $10,000, contracts from preferred sources, and emergency, sole\nor single source contracts require no prior publication. Post-publication is\nrequired for those contracts described in paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nContracts from\n$10,000.01 to less than $20,000 require quarterly publication of a list of\nprojected procurements by commodity and/or service, together with an\nexplanation of how to apply for placement on any bidder lists and the procedure\nfor providing advance notice by mail to those on the campus bidders\nlist. (3)\n\nContracts from $20,000 to\n$30,000 for commodities purchased under the authority of the New York State\n\nOffice of General Services require no publication. (4)\n\nContracts for all other purchases from\n$20,000 and above require publication at least 15 business days in advance of\nthe date on which a bid or proposal is due, unless a shorter period is\nspecifically authorized by law. (5)\n\nCampuses receiving an emergency, sole or single source exemption from\npublication must subsequently publish a notice of either the letting or award\nof the purchase/contract, and the reasons for such exemption, in the New York\n\nState Contract Reporter. (b) Competitive selection process. (1)\n\nUp to $50,000, a campus may purchase\ncommodities or services directly from a responsible vendor of its choice\nwithout formal competitive bidding. While no competitive bidding is required, a\ncampus should take the steps necessary to ensure that prices are\nreasonable. (2)\n\nOver $50,000 up to\n$125,000, a campus must solicit a minimum of three informal quotations or\nproposals from responsible vendors. (3)\n\nOver $125,000, a campus must solicit a\nminimum of five sealed bids or proposals. (4)\n\nThe following types of\ncontracts/purchases are exempt from the above bidding requirements: (i) purchases from existing New York State\n\nOffice of General Services centralized State contracts; (ii)\nsole source, single source or emergency\ncontracts; (iii)\ncontracts under\nwhich the university provides consideration other than money; (iv)\n\nIntercollegiate Athletics NCAA Division\n1 Program procurements up to $250,000, upon written determination that\ncompetition is not feasible due to the unique nature of the program or\ncircumstances. Such determination must be consistent with standard NCAA\nDivision 1 practices used for intercollegiate athletics programs nationally. The selection must be justified and the prices demonstrated to be reasonable\nand competitive; (v) purchases not\nexceeding $125,000 from small business and certified minority-and women-owned\nbusiness enterprises, and of a commodity or technology that is recycled or\nmanufactured, provided that the campus shall purchase from a responsible vendor\nand should take steps necessary to ensure that prices are reasonable; and\n(vi)\nthe purchase of New York\n\nState labeled wine, produced by a winery licensed in accordance with the\nrequirements of section\n76\nof the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law\nshall be exempt from competitive requirements, regardless of amount. For the\npurposes of this subparagraph, New York State labeled wine is made from grapes, at least 75 percent of the volume of which were grown in New York\n\nState. (c) Competitive bid or proposal considerations. (1)\n\nThe University only awards contracts to\nresponsible vendors. In the event a question of responsibility exists, the\nvendor is given the opportunity to submit a proposal. During the evaluation\nperiod, a review of that vendor's responsibility will be made a part of the\nfinal evaluation and award process. (2)\n\nWhere factors in addition to cost will be\nevaluated when making a contract award, offerors must be apprised of the\nrelative importance or weight of the cost criteria compared with all non-cost\ncriteria. (3)\n\nThe following\nprovisions are required to be included in State solicitations. (i) Every offer shall be firm and not\nrevocable for a period of 60 days from the bid opening, or such other period of\ntime specified in the solicitation. Subsequent to such 60-day or other\nspecified period, an offer may be withdrawn in writing. (ii)\n\nAny response to a solicitation which\nproposes or requires the use of any tropical hardwood or wood product in the\nperformance of a contract shall be deemed non-responsive. (4)\n\nEvaluation of proposals. When cost\nfactors (e.g., extended warranty coverage, maintenance, supply costs, etc.) are\nto be considered in an Invitation for Bids (IFB) in addition to the base bid\nprice, each such factor must be identified in the IFB. When evaluating bids, the cost of each such factor must be calculated and added to the base in order\nto determine the lowest price. (d) Notification. Campuses are encouraged to\nnotify all offerors as to whether they are successful or unsuccessful. Upon\nrequest, it is recommended that an unsuccessful offeror should be provided a\ndebriefing as to why it was unsuccessful. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
