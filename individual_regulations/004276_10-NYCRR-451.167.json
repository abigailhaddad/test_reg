  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 451.167 - Internal control\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The general\nmethodology by which management is carried on within an organization; also, any\nof the numerous devices for supervising and directing an operation or\noperations generally. Internal control, a management function, is a basic\nfactor operating in one form or another in the administration of every\norganization, business or otherwise. Although sometimes identified with the\nadministrative organism itself, it is often characterized as the nervous system\nthat activates overall operating policies and keeps them within practicable\nperformance ranges. The principal elements contributing to internal control are\nusually these: (1)\nrecognition that within\nevery organizational unit there are one or more functional or action components\nknown as activities, cost or responsibility centers, or management units with\nappropriate segregation of functional responsibilities; (2)\ndelegated operating authority in each\norganizational unit permitting freedom of action within defined\nlimits; (3)\nthe linking of\nexpenditures--their incurrence and disposition--with specified individual\nauthority; (4)\nend-product\nplanning: (i) by means of a budget fitted to\nthe organizational structure and to its functional components, thus maintaining\ndual forward operating disciplines; and\n(ii)\nthe adoption of standards of comparison\nand other performance measurements such as standard costs, quality controls and\ntiming goals; (5)\nan\naccounting process and system of record procedures adequate to provide\norganizational and functional administrators with reasonable accounting control\nover assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and also provide administrators\nwith prompt, complete and accurate information on operating performance, and\ncomparisons with predetermined performance standards; (6)\nperiodic reports, consonant with\naccounting and related records, by activity heads to supervisory management; reports serving as feedbacks of informative pictures of operations, and as\ndisplays of favorable and unfavorable factors that have influenced\nperformance; (7)\ninternal check, built into operating procedures, and providing maximum protection against fraud\nand error; (8)\nfrequent\nprofessional appraisals, through internal audit, of management and its policies\nand operations generally, as a protective and constructive management service, its emphasis varying with the quality of operating policies and their\nadministration. (b) The\nconstruction of the above controls in such a manner as to stimulate and take\nfull advantage of those natural attributes of individual employees, i.e., personnel of a quality commensurate with responsibilities.
