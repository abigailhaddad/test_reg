Tit. 21 § 5.16 - Security officer's and supervisory security officer's log\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe commission shall furnish a log for each pier or\nwaterfront terminal which shall remain the property of the commission and be\nkept in the custody of the security officer or supervisory security officer\nassigned to the gate who shall be responsible for its safekeeping, or in such\nother place as may be authorized by the commission. Every security officer or\nsupervisory security officer, upon entering or leaving the pier or terminal, shall enter in such log his signature, license number, time in or time out and\nsuch other information as may be required by the commission. All such logs\nshall be available for inspection by the commission at any time. In lieu of\nsuch a log, the commission may, in its discretion, authorize, at any particular\npier or waterfront terminal, the use of any mechanical or electrical instrument\nor device which provides the information required by this section and which\nshall be deemed the equivalent of a log for the purpose of this section (except\nthat its ownership shall not be in the commission unless such instrument is\noriginally furnished by the commission).
