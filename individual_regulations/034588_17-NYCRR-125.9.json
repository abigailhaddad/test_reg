  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 125.9 - Residential driveways\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A sketch of\nthe proposed driveway shall be submitted with each permit\napplication. (b) The surface and\nmaterial of residential driveways and field entrances shall be subject to the\nfollowing conditions: (1)\n\nResidential\ndriveways shall have a paved surface extending at least 10 feet back from the\nedge of the travel lane. In cases where traffic using the driveway or entrance\nis very low and lightweight, such that no damage to the State facility will\noccur, the Resident Engineer may waive the requirement that the property owner\npave the apron. (2)\n\nIf an asphalt\nconcrete or cement concrete driveway is to be constructed adjacent to the\nhighway shoulder pavement or stabilized with a bituminous material in\nsatisfactory condition, it is not necessary to remove existing shoulder\nmaterial. The edge of the shoulder shall be squared off and the driveway paved\nup to the bituminous surface. The bituminous shoulder will then constitute all\nor a portion of the required 10 foot paved surface. (3)\n\nIf an existing shoulder is disturbed or\nmodified in any way, the permittee shall replace the shoulder in kind or as\ndirected by the department. (4)\n\nIf\nan asphalt concrete or cement concrete driveway is to be constructed on a\nhighway with gravel shoulders or where the bituminous shoulder is in an\nunsatisfactory condition, the existing shoulder material shall be removed and\nthe driveway paved up to the edge of the travel lane. The driveway portion\nwithin the shoulder area shall be paved with asphalt material only. (5)\n\nThe minimal acceptable thickness of\ndriveway material within the 10 foot limit shall be either one and one-half\ninches of asphalt concrete or four and one-half inches of cement concrete both\nconstructed on a six inch gravel base. Within the shoulder area no cement\nconcrete shall be used. (6)\n\nThe\nmaterial and surface of field entrances can consist of gravel or stone and they\nmay be connected to the edge of the highway shoulder without removing any of\nthe existing shoulder material. (c) The design dimensions described and\nillustrated in sections 125.13 and\n125.20\nof this Part will provide\nsafety and ease of turning movements for average passenger cars and are\nrecommended for use by the applicant in building a residential\ndriveway. (d) The outline of the\ncorner treatment of a residential driveway (see section\n125.13, figure 1A) can be\ndetermined by simply obtaining values R, X and Y from section\n125.20\nfor given values of\ndriveway width (W) and corner angle (O). Two sets of values must be obtained\nfor driveways intersecting the highway at other than 90 degrees, since two\ndifferent corner angles are involved. A corner angle of 90 degrees, placing the\ndriveway at right angles to the highway, and a driveway width of 12 feet is\nconsidered standard and should normally be used. Other angles and widths may be\nselected for a particular location if an engineering determination indicates\nthey would be more suitable. Corner angles of less than 60 degrees and more\nthan 120 degrees shall not be permitted. The department reserves the right to\nspecify particular dimensions for any driveway to ensure maximum compatibility\nbetween operation and safety, consistent with site development. (e) Actual field layout for the driveway\ncorner treatment can be accomplished with a tape measure, by the following\nsteps (see section\n125.13, figure 1A): (1)\nlocate Point A, the intersection of the\nhighway pavement edge and the projected driveway pavement edge; (2)\nfrom Point A measure the given X and Y\ndistances to locate Points B and C; (3)\nat the given R distance from Points B and\nC, scribe two arcs to intersect at Point D; (4)\nlayout the driveway corner radius by\nscribing an arc between Points B and C from Point D, using distance\nR.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
