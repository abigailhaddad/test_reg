  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 1-1.4 - Effectively connected income\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe term \"effectively connected income\" means income, gain, or loss that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or\nbusiness within the United States as determined under IRC section 882 in the\ncase of an alien corporation that under any provision of the IRC is not treated\nas a domestic corporation as defined in IRC section 7701. It includes income, gain, or loss that is described in section 208(9)(b) and excluded from Federal\ntaxable income under any provision of Federal law, including under a United\n\nStates treaty obligation, that would be treated, in the absence of such\nexclusion, as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business\nwithin the United States. Income, gain, or loss excluded from Federal taxable\nincome under a United States treaty obligation will be deemed to be treated as\neffectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United\n\nStates unless such treaty prohibits state taxation of such income, gain, or\nloss.
