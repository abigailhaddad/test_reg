  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 126.14 - Disciplinary actions and penalties\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Disciplinary action against schools. In\ndetermining the penalty to be imposed upon a finding that disciplinary action\nagainst a school is warranted, in accordance with the provisions of Education\n\nLaw, section 5003, the commissioner shall take into account the effect of the\nconduct which formed the basis for the disciplinary proceeding upon the\nstudents attending the school, the general public and any other affected\nindividual or group. Prior to initiating action against schools during the\ninitial two-year licensing period, the commissioner shall take into\nconsideration the factors set forth in section\n5003\n(1)(d)\nof the Education Law. (b) Disciplinary actions against private\nschool agents. (1)\n\nThe commissioner, after\naffording a certified private school agent notice and an opportunity to be\nheard, may fine such agent, or suspend or revoke such agent's certificate at\nany time for failure to comply with the requirements of the Education Law or of\nthis Part or for any other good cause. (2)\n\nRevocation or suspension of a private\nschool agent's certificate. Where the commissioner seeks to revoke or suspend a\nprivate school agent's certificate, the certificate holder shall be given\nreasonable notice of the nature of the proceeding and a statement sufficiently\nparticular to give notice of the transactions and occurrences involved and the\nmaterial elements of each cause of action against the certificate holder. The\ncertificate holder shall also be given notice of an opportunity for a hearing\nin accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (i) If a hearing is requested, the\ncertificate holder shall be given reasonable notice of the time, place and\nnature of the hearing. The certificate holder may appear in person or may be\nrepresented at the hearing by an attorney, may respond and present evidence and\nargument on the issues involved, and may cross-examine witnesses. The hearing, at which a verbatim record shall be taken, shall be held before a hearing\nofficer designated by the commissioner, who shall have the powers of a\npresiding officer in accordance with section 304 of the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act. The strict rules of evidence shall not apply to such hearings, but the decision of the hearing officer shall be supported by substantial\nevidence in the record. Disposition may be made in any hearing by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order, default or other informal method. The\ndecision of the hearing officer shall be delivered or mailed forthwith to the\ncertificate holder and to his or her attorney of record. (ii)\n\nIf a hearing is not requested, the\ncommissioner shall issue a determination based upon the evidence submitted in\nsupport of the charges and any additional evidence submitted by the certificate\nholder. (3)\n\nFines. Where\nthe commissioner seeks to impose a fine on a certified private school agent for\nmisconduct not warranting a more severe disciplinary penalty, the department\nshall serve notice of the charges upon the certificate holder either by\npersonal service or certified mail. Such notice shall specify the basis for the\ncharges with sufficient particularity to apprise the certificate holder of the\nnature of the incidents or transactions leading to the charges, and shall\ncontain a statement that unless an answer to the charges is received by the\ndepartment within 20 days after personal service of the notice or within 25\ndays after service by certified mail, the charges will be deemed to be true and\na fine will be imposed. The certificate holder may answer the charges and may\nsubmit evidence in written form, including affidavits, in support of such\nanswer. If the commissioner finds that the charges of misconduct are supported\nby substantial evidence, the commissioner shall impose an appropriate fine and\nshall notify the certificate holder of such determination by mail. Failure to\npay such a fine within four months after receipt of such notice shall\nconstitute good cause for suspension or revocation of a private school agent's\ncertificate. (4)\n\nIndemnification. No employer of a private school agent other than a school may indemnify or\notherwise reimburse an agent for fines imposed on the agent pursuant to this\nsubdivision and Education Law, section 5004(7). If the agent demonstrates, to\nthe satisfaction of the commissioner, that the action for which the agent was\nfined was undertaken because of explicit instructions from the school owner, director, or other school administrator, the commissioner shall take\nappropriate disciplinary action against the school in accordance with Education\n\nLaw, section 5003, to require the school to indemnify or reimburse the agent\nthe amount of the fine and pay to the commissioner an additional fine of an\nequal amount. (c) Pursuant to section\n5001\n(9)\nof the Education Law, any annual\nassessment fees submitted by the schools to the department after the due date\nshall be subject to an interest penalty. The commissioner shall calculate the\namount of the interest penalty as follows: (1)\n\nFor each due date, payments made within\n30 days following such due date shall be subject to an interest penalty of one\npercent above the prevailing prime rate. [(3)]\n(2)\n\nInterest\npenalties not paid within 15 days of notification of the amount of the penalty\nmay be increased in accordance with the method used by the commissioner to\ncompute the interest penalty in the first instance.
