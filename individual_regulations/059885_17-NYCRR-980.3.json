(e) Public transportation service means a\npassenger transportation service which, during its hours of operations, is\navailable on an equal opportunity basis to any person, without preference for\nservice availability, eligibility or design being given to any person or\npopulation sub-group because of age, gender, race, national origin, creed or\nagency client status, and which is regularly advertised and marketed as\navailable to the general public.

Such\ncoordinated public transportation service shall offer service to the general\npublic to at least the same extent and degree, in terms of service levels, operating hours and geographic coverage, as service is offered for clients of\nhuman service agency programs, and shall seek to increase service to\ntransportation disadvantaged persons who do not receive transportation from a\nhuman or social services agency program.

A specialized transportation service shall be available on an\nequal opportunity basis to all transit disabled persons within a market segment\ndetermined solely by the amount of physical assistance needed by passengers. Transportation services ordinarily provided by a human service agency and\ndesigned for an agency's clients to access its program are not, per se, considered to be specialized transportation services.
