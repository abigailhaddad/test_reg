(b) 'Significant Permit Modifications'. (1)\n\nThe\nfollowing changes to existing facilities are considered significant\nmodifications: (i) Changes that cause the\nfacility to become subject to a new applicable requirement; (ii)\n\nChanges that result in less stringent\nmonitoring, record keeping, or reporting requirements; (iii)\n\nChanges that seek to establish or\nchange a case-by-case determination or department approved variance; (iv)\n\nChanges that seek to establish or change\na federally enforceable emissions cap or a permit term or condition that the\nfacility has accepted to avoid an applicable requirement to which the facility\nwould otherwise be subject; and\n(v) Changes that are modifications under any provision of Title I of the Act that\nresult in an emissions increase in excess of the NSR major facility thresholds\ncontained i n Subpart 231-13 of this Title. (2)\n\nApplications for significant permit\nmodifications are subject to the public noticing requirements f or new\napplications pursuant to the requirements of Part 621 of this Title. The\nmodified permit must be issued before the facility owner or operator may\ncommence construction or operation of the requested modification. (c) 'Minor Permit Modifications'. (1)\nA minor modification is any change at an\nexisting facility that meets the definition of modification at Part 200.1(aq)\nof this Title and is not a significant modification as described in Subdivision\n(b) of this Section. (2)\n\nThe\ndepartment will review and act on applications for minor permit modifications\nin accordance with the requirements for minor projects under Part 621 of this\n\nTitle. (3)\n\nThe facility owner or\noperator may proceed with the requested minor modification upon receipt o f a\nnotice of complete application from the department confirming that the\nmodification is minor. If the department fails to make a completeness\ndetermination, the application shall be deemed complete by default on the 15th\nday after receipt of the application and the facility owner or operator may\nproceed with the requested modification on the 25th day after the date that the\ndepartment received the application. After the facility owner or operator makes\nthe change and until the department takes final action, or notifies the\nfacility owner or operator that the requested modification does not meet the\nminor modification criteria, the facility owner or operator must comply with\nboth the applicable requirements governing the change and any proposed permit\nterms and conditions contained in the application. During this time period, the\nfacility owner or operator need not comply with the existing permit terms and\nconditions for which a modification is proposed. However, if the facility owner\nor operator fails to comply with the proposed permit terms and conditions\nduring this time period, the existing permit terms and conditions for which a\nmodification is proposed may be enforced against it. (d) 'Advance Notifications'. The owner or\noperator of a facility subject to the requirements of this Section may make\nchanges that meet all of the criteria in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this\nsubdivision without the prior approval of the department. The owner or operator\nof the facility must notify the department in writing at least 15 days in\nadvance of making each such change, as described in subdivision (e) of this\nsection. (1)\n\nThe change is not a significant\nmodification as described in subdivision (a) of this section; (2)\n\nThe change does not cause facility\nemissions to exceed any emission limitation or other condition in the\nfacility's permit or result in emissions of a regulated contaminant not\npreviously emitted or authorized under a permit; (3)\n\nThe change does not cause the facility to\nbecome subject to any additional applicable requirements or regulations under\nthis Title; and\n(4)\n\nThe change does\nnot seek to establish or change a federally-enforceable emission cap or limit, or the monitoring, record keeping, or reporting requirement associated with the\nemission cap or limit. (e) Advance notifications required by\nsubdivision (d) of this section shall include the following information: (1)\nidentification of the emission unit(s), process(es), emission source(s), and emission point(s) affected by the proposed\nchange; (2)\ndate on which the\nchange is to occur; (3)\ndescription\nof the proposed change; (4)\nif\nappropriate, the identification and description of emissions control technology\nand compliance terms; and\n(5)\nthe\nidentification of all contaminants emitted by the affected emission sources and\ncalculations of the emission rate potential, potential to emit, and projected\nactual annual emission rates after the proposed change. (f) The owner or operator of a facility which\nhas made a change pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section must maintain a\nrecord of the date and description of each such change at the facility, and\nshall include each change in the facility's next permit renewal or modification\napplication. These records shall be maintained at the facility until the\nchanges are incorporated into the facility's permit and must be made available\nf or review by department representatives upon request. (g) The department may require a permit\nmodification to impose applicable requirements or permit conditions if it\ndetermines that changes proposed pursuant to the advance notification\nrequirements of subdivision (d) of this section do not meet the established\ncriteria, or that the changes may have a significant air quality impact. In\nsuch cases, the department shall require that the facility owner or operator\nnot undertake the proposed changes until a permit modification is issued.
