  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 §§ 143-3.5 - Acceptance of XML documents\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\nXML document is not accepted for filing at the time it is received by the\ncentral filing office's XML system, even if said XML system then sends a signal\nto the remitter indicating that the remitter's XML transmission has been\nreceived. An XML document is accepted for filing only after the XML document is\nanalyzed by the central filing office's XML system, and the central filing\noffice determines that: (1)\nthe XML document\nis machine-readable; (2)\nall\nrequired elements of the transmission have been received in an approved format; and\n(3)\nthe XML document is not to\nbe refused under section\n143-3.6\nof this Subpart. (b) The central filing office may\nfrom time to time determine the days and times during which the central filing\noffice's XML system will receive XML transmissions, and the days and times\nduring which the central filing office's XML system will analyze XML documents\nin the manner described in subdivision (a) of this section. The days and times\nduring which the central filing office's XML system will analyze XML documents\nwill not necessarily be the same as the days and times during which the central\nfiling office's XML system will receive XML transmissions, and an XML\ntransmission will not necessarily be analyzed on the same business day that it\nis received by the central filing office's XML system. (c) Upon acceptance of an XML document for\nfiling, the central filing office shall provide electronic notice to the\nremitter to confirm such acceptance, and to confirm the date and time of\nfiling. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§§\n143-3.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
