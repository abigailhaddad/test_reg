  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 214.3 - Coal charging systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Visible\nemissions must not exceed 150 seconds from any five consecutive charges at a\nsingle battery when measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in\nsubdivisions (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section. (b) For the purpose of determining compliance\nwith subdivision (a) of this section, visible emissions are those emissions of\nany degree of opacity greater than zero discharged during the charging of coal\nto the coke oven, including emissions from the offtake piping, larry car\nhoppers, drop sleeves, jumper pipes, charging holes or any of the oven\nequipment and tools associated with this operation. (c) In conveyor-type coal charging systems, the observer will read visible emissions only from the charging holes, offtake\npiping, charging buggy, drop sleeves, the interface between the charging buggy\nand the conveyor, the conveyor system and any other equipment associated with\nthe charging operation subsequent to the coal feed to the conveyor. This\nprocedure will be followed whether the conveyor system is charging the battery\nwith wet or dry coal. (d) Compliance\nwill be determined by observing and timing with a cumulative stopwatch the\nvisible emissions from each oven charged during a series of consecutive charges\nof a single battery. The observer will be positioned on the battery top, at a\ndistance of five to ten ovens from the oven being charged. In the event that\nsuch a position results in an obstructed view, the observer must assume another\nposition to allow a clear view of the emissions. The cumulative time of visible\nemissions during the charging of each oven must be recorded. Visible emissions\ndischarged simultaneously from more than one point on the same oven will be\ntimed as a single emission. (e) Compliance with the emission limit will be determined by summing the cumulative\ntimes for any single series of five consecutive charges and comparing this\ntotal with the appropriate standard. An obscured charge or other interruptions\nto the observations being made of a series of charges will not disrupt an\notherwise consecutive series in calculating compliance with the emission limit. The longest cumulative time of any visible emission for a single charge in a\ngroup of any 20 charges at any battery will be disregarded, but will not\ndisrupt any otherwise consecutive series in calculating compliance with the\nemission limit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n214.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
