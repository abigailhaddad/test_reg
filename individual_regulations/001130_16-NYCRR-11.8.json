  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 11.8 - Service to two-family dwellings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of this section, the term two-family dwelling shall mean a\nbuilding designed and occupied pursuant to local building codes exclusively by\ntwo families living independently of each other, irrespective of whether the\nbuilding receives a residential or commercial rate under the utility's tariff. If a utility knows that any utility service is provided to both units of a\ntwo-family dwelling through a single meter, the utility shall not terminate, disconnect or suspend such service unless the utility complies with the\nrequirements of this section. A utility shall be deemed to know that a\ntwo-family building contains units that are not metered separately where it is\nnotified by the customer, occupant or other person that the building is a\ntwo-family dwelling. Each utility shall keep a record of such two-family\ndwellings where service is not metered separately. (b) The utility shall give 15 days' written\nnotice of its intention to terminate, disconnect or suspend service to a\ntwo-family dwelling that it knows contains units where service is not metered\nseparately by mailing a copy of the notice to the owner of the premises or to\nthe recipient of the last preceding service bill, mailing or otherwise\ndelivering a copy of the notice to each occupied unit, and, unless precluded by\nphysical circumstances, posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place at\nor within the dwelling. (c) The\nnotice shall provide the information required by section\n11.4\n(a)(2)(i)-\n(iv)\nof this Part, state that there are\nspecial protections for occupants of two-family dwellings where service is not\nmetered separately, that the commission staff may be contacted for information\nand advice, and that subdivision (1) of section\n235-a\nof\nthe Real Property Law authorizes occupants to set off against their rents\npayments to utilities in such circumstances. (d) Any occupant of a two-family dwelling\nthat contains units where service is not metered separately may prevent\ntermination, disconnection or suspension of service if: (1)\nan occupant eligible for service under\nsection\n11.3\nof this Part applies for and\nreceives service, thereby making himself or herself liable for future payments, provided that such person is not an agent of the recipient of the last\npreceding service bill; or\n(2)\nan\noccupant who chooses to pay current charges shall not be liable for any future\nbills rendered for utility service. In the event of such payment, the utility\nshall continue to render all bills to the customer of record with a copy to be\nsent to any occupant [continued] upon request. If billing for the service which\nis not metered separately is on a monthly basis, current charges shall be\ndefined as an amount not to exceed that due for billed service provided during\nthe two months preceding the termination, disconnection or suspension date set\nforth in the notice. If the billing for the service which is not metered\nseparately is on a bimonthly basis, then current charges shall be defined as an\namount not to exceed the most recent bill for service. (e) The commission's authorized designees\nshall be available to advise occupants of two-family dwellings of the\nprotections provided by this section. (f) Whenever a final notice of termination, disconnection or suspension of utility service has been provided under this\nsection and the past-due bills owed to a utility for service to a two-family\ndwelling in which service is provided through a single meter have been\nsatisfied, the utility shall so notify the occupants of the dwelling by mailing\nor otherwise delivering such notice to the occupants of such dwelling or\nposting such notice in a conspicuous place at or within the dwelling. (g) During the cold weather period, defined\nin section\n11.5\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Part, a utility intending to terminate, disconnect or suspend heat-related\nservice, as that term is defined in section\n11.5\n(c)(1), to a\ntwo-family dwelling shall provide the written notices required under\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section not less than 30 days before the\nintended termination, disconnection or suspension. (h) During the cold weather period defined in\nsection\n11.5\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Part, a utility intending to terminate, disconnect or suspend service to a\ntwo-family dwelling shall comply with either the requirements set forth in\nsection\n11.5\n(c) or in\nsection\n11.7\n(g) of this\n\nPart.
