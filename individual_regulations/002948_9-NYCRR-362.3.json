  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 362.3 - Applicability and rationale\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part is applicable to violations of conditional release\nsupervision. (b) The rationale for\nthis Part is as follows: (1)\n\nConditional\nrelease as an alternative to incarceration is a means of offering the offender\nthe opportunity for law-abiding adjustment in the community. It is the\nprobation department's responsibility to see that the conditions of conditional\nrelease are properly enforced and to inform the local conditional release\ncommission of any significant deviation. (2)\n\nUniform procedures controlling violation\nof conditional release matters serve to facilitate uniform decisionmaking and\nthe reduction of any possible disparity in the treatment of like\ncases. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n362.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
