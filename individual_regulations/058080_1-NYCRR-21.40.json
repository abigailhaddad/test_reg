The prices and pricing factors described in subdivisions (a), (b), (c), (e), (f) and (g) of this section shall be based on a weighted average of\nthe most recent two weekly prices announced by the National Agricultural\n\nStatistical Service (NASS) before the 24th day of the month. These prices shall\nbe announced on or before the 23rd day of the month and shall apply to milk\nreceived during the following month. The prices described in subdivisions\n(g)-(o) of this section shall be based on a weighted average for the preceding\nmonth of weekly prices announced by NASS on or before the fifth day of the\nmonth and shall apply to milk received during the preceding month. The price\ndescribed in subdivision (d) of this section shall be derived from the Class II\nskim milk price announced on or before the 23rd day of the month preceding the\nmonth to which it applies and the butterfat price announced on or before the\nfifth day of the month following the month to which it applies. (a) Class I price. The Class I price per\nhundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be.965 times the Class I skim\nmilk price plus 3.5 times the Class I butterfat price.

The Class III price per\nhundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent, shall be.965 times the Class III\nskim milk price plus 3.5 times the butterfat price. (i) Class III skim milk price.

(m) Nonfat solids price. The nonfat solids\nprice per pound, rounded to the nearest one- hundredth cent, shall be the U.S. average NASS nonfat dry milk survey price reported by the U.S. Department of\n\nAgriculture for the month less 13.7 cents, with the result divided by\n1.02. (n) Protein price. The\nprotein price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be\ncomputed as follows: (1)\ncompute a weighted\naverage of the amounts described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph: (i) the U.S. average NASS survey\nprice for 40-pound block cheddar cheese reported by the U.S. Department of\n\nAgriculture for the month; and\n(ii)\nthe U.S. average NASS survey price for 500-pound barrel cheddar cheese (39\npercent moisture) reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the month\nplus 3 cents; (2)\nsubtract 17.02 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision and multiply the result by 1.405; (3)\nadd to the amount computed pursuant to\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision an amount computed as follows: (i) subtract 17.02 cents from the price\ncomputed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision and multiply the result\nby 1.582; (ii)\nsubtract the\nbutterfat price computed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision from the\namount computed pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; and\n(iii)\nmultiply the amount computed pursuant\nto subparagraph (ii) of this subdivision by 1.28.

(p) [Reserved]\n(q) Advanced pricing factors. For the purpose\nof computing the Class I skim milk price, the Class II skim milk price, the\n\nClass II nonfat solids price, and the Class I butterfat price for the following\nmonth, the following pricing factors shall be computed using the weighted\naverage of the two most recent NASS U.S. average weekly survey prices announced\nbefore the 24th day of the month: (1)\nan\nadvanced Class III skim milk price per hundredweight, rounded to the nearest\ncent, shall be computed as follows: (i) following the procedure set forth in subdivisions (n) and (o) of this section, but using the weighted average of the two most recent NASS U.S. average weekly\nsurvey prices announced before the 24th day of the month, compute a protein\nprice and an other solids price; (ii)\nmultiply the protein price computed in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph by 3.1; (iii)\nmultiply the other solids price per\npound computed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph by 5.9; and\n(iv)\nadd the amounts computed in\nsubparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nAn advanced Class IV skim milk price per\nhundredweight, rounded to the nearest cent shall be computed as follows: (i) following the procedure set forth in\nsubdivision (m) of this section, but using the weighted average of the two most\nrecent NASS U.S. average weekly survey prices announced before the 24th day of\nthe month, compute a nonfatsolids price; and\n(ii)\nmultiply the nonfat solids price\ncomputed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph by 9. (3)\n\nAn advanced butterfat price per pound, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth cent, shall be calculated by computing a\nweighted average of the two most recent U.S. average NASS AA Butter survey\nprices announced before the 24th day of the month, subtracting 11.4 cents from\nthis average, and dividing the result by 0.82.
