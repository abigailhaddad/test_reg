  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 2-1.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, sections 208(10), 209(1))\n(a) Generally, for Federal income tax\npurposes, a taxpayer's taxable year is the same as its accounting period. In\nmost cases, the taxable year for which the franchise tax imposed by article 9-A\nis to be computed and for which a franchise tax report is to be filed shall be\nthe same as the taxpayer's taxable year for Federal income tax purposes, or\nthat portion of the Federal taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to\nthe tax imposed by article 9-A. The taxable year under article 9-A generally\nwill be the accounting period covered by the taxpayer's Federal income tax\nreturn, whether such period be a calendar year, a properly established fiscal\nyear (which includes an accounting period consisting of 52 - 53 weeks) or an\naccounting period of less than 12 months as permitted or required under the\nIRC. If a taxpayer does not have a taxable year for Federal income tax\npurposes, the tax must be computed and a report must be filed for a calendar\nyear, unless the commissioner authorizes the use of some different accounting\nperiod. (b) The tax imposed by\narticle 9-A is imposed for each fiscal or calendar year of the taxpayer, or any\npart thereof, during which the taxpayer has a corporate franchise granted by\n\nNew York State or does business, employs capital, owns or leases property in a\ncorporate or organized capacity, maintains an office, or derives receipts from\nactivity in New York State. Therefore, for purposes of article 9-A, the\ntaxpayer's first taxable year begins, in the case of a domestic corporation, on\nthe date of its incorporation or, if elected, on such other date for the\nbeginning of its corporate existence as set forth in the certificate of\nincorporation, not to exceed 90 days after the filing of such certificate, and\nends on the last day of such fiscal or calendar year, or on the last day it is\nsubject to the tax imposed by article 9-A, whichever comes first. In the case\nof a foreign corporation, the taxpayer's first taxable year begins on the date\nit begins to do business, employ capital, own or lease property, maintain an\noffice, or derive receipts from activity in New York State and ends on the last\nday of such fiscal or calendar year, or on the last day it is subject to the\ntax imposed by article 9-A, whichever comes first.
