  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 163.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purpose of this Part, the following definitions shall apply: (a) Base rate means the dollar charge for a given coverage for one car year prior to the application of rating factors. (b) Car year means insuring a motor vehicle for one year. (c) Coverage means the following motor vehicle insurance coverages: (1)\nno-fault (personal injury protection), residual bodily injury liability, property damage liability, statutory uninsured motorists, supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists, comprehensive, and collision; and\n(2)\nany other motor vehicle coverage. (d) Current average rate for a given coverage means the weighted average of an insurer's latest filed base rates modified by the applicable rating factors for each motor vehicle for the given coverage with the weights proportional to the latest available number of car years associated with each rating factor, or any materially equivalent calculation. (e) Current overall average rate means: (1)\nthe weighted average of the current average rate for: (i) all coverages listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and\n(ii)\nany other motor vehicle coverages not listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the insurer proposes a change in the rate for that coverage, with the weights proportional to the latest available number of car years for the respective coverages; or\n(2)\nany materially equivalent calculation. (f) Effective date means the date a revised set of base rates or rating factors shall apply to all existing nonbusiness automobile insurance policies as such policies are renewed. If a filing only applies to new business, then the effective date means the date that an insurer may first write new business. (g) File and use means the process by which an insurer files with the superintendent a proposed overall average rate change that is within the flex-band, and then uses the proposed overall average rate change without having to obtain the superintendent's prior approval. (h) Flexibility band or flex-band means the range of overall average rate increase or decrease (up to +-5 percent) within an insurer may change its motor vehicle insurance rates without having to obtain the superintendent's prior approval. (i) Motor vehicle has the meaning set forth in section\n5102 (f)\nof the Insurance Law. (j) Nonbusiness automobile insurance policy means a contract of insurance covering losses or liabilities arising out of the ownership, operation or use of a motor vehicle that is predominately used for nonbusiness purposes, when a natural person is the named insured. (k) Proposed average rate for a given coverage means the weighted average of an insurer's proposed base rates modified by the applicable rating factors for each motor vehicle for the given coverage with the weights proportional to the latest available number of car years associated with each rating factor, or any materially equivalent calculation. (l) Proposed overall average rate means: (1)\nthe weighted average of the proposed average rate for: (i) each coverage listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section regardless of whether the insurer is filing a change for that coverage; and\n(ii)\nany other motor vehicle coverages not listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the insurer proposes a change in the rate for that coverage, with the weights proportional to the latest available number of car years for the respective coverages; or\n(2)\nany materially equivalent calculation. (m) Proposed overall average rate change means the percentage difference between the proposed overall average rate and the current overall average rate. For example, if the proposed overall average rate is $1,200 and the current overall average rate is $1,000, then the proposed overall average rate change is 20 percent ([(1,200/1,000)-1] x 100). (n) Rating factors means the various elements that are applied or added to the base rates to obtain the actual nonbusiness automobile insurance policy premiums. These include classification factors based on the age, sex, and marital status of the insured, territorial rating factors, merit rating factors based on the driving record of the insured, increased limit factors, motor vehicle symbol and model year rating factors, and multi-tier rating factors.
