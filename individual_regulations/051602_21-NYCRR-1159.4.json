  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1159.4 - Guidelines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Procurement protocol. The primary objective of procurement is to ensure and foster\neconomy, efficiency and effectiveness in the acquisition of goods and services. To achieve these goals it is essential that all of the participants in the\nprocurement process have a clear understanding of their roles and\nresponsibilities. Set forth in this subdivision is a general outline of the\nvarious departmental functions to be fulfilled in the procurement process. The\nprocurement department maintains a comprehensive written procurement systems\nmanual based on these concepts. (1)\n\nProcurement department. (i) The procurement\ndepartment shall be responsible for conducting the following minimum\npre-procurement planning activities on at least an annual basis: (a) forecasting the price and availability of\nitems and materials for user departments; (b) developing a purchasing schedule for IFBs\nand RFPs; (c) establishing\npurchasing goals and objectives. (ii)\n\nThe functions of the procurement\ndepartment shall be to: (a) analyze the\nmarketplace to determine the status of competition, technological developments, the impact of the economy on potential vendors, labor conditions, and changes\nin pricing or delivery methods; (b) communicate and coordinate with similarly situated procurement departments to\nexplore joint purchasing arrangements and to share marketplace\ninformation; (c) analyze user\ndepartment procurement requisitions to ensure the proper authorizations are\npresent, and that the procurement is tailored to meet the authority's needs and\nis not unnecessary or duplicative. Consideration should be given to\nconsolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical\npurchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase\nalternatives and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most\neconomical approach; (d) prepare\ninvitation for bids, requests for proposals, informal solicitations, and\nnotices of procurement opportunity, as needed; (e) administer the acquisition process, including: ensuring adequate advertisement of the notice of procurement\nopportunity; surveying sources; serving as contact for potential contractors; and accepting, opening, evaluating, and tabulating bids; (f) remain current and in compliance with\napplicable Federal and State laws; (g) maintain vendors files; (h) maintain all support documentation\nincluding small purchases procurement authorization, small purchase tabulation\nand solicitation summary, single bid/proposal validation reports and single\nsource validation report. (i) develop MWBE and SDVOB participation goals, monitor MWBE and SD VOB\nparticipation, and report MWBE and SDVOB utilization to appropriate state\nagencies. (2)\n\nUser department (the department in need of and requesting the procurement of\ngoods or services). (i) It shall be the\nresponsibility of each user department to evaluate its projected procurement\nneeds on an annual basis, and to undertake and coordinate procurement planning\nactivities with the procurement department, annually. (ii)\n\nFor the procurement of any product or\nservice of $50,000, or more, the user department shall prepare a written\nrequisition and submit same to the procurement department a minimum of three\nmonths prior to the desired delivery, bid opening, performance, or proposal due\ndate. For purchases under $50,000, the requisitions shall be submitted to the\nprocurement department 10 days in advance. The requisition shall serve as the\nmechanism by which the user department communicates its specific procurement\nneed to the procurement department and it represents the beginning of the\nprocurement process. (iii)\n\nThe\nrequisition shall include the following elements: (a) properly completed form per the\nauthority's requisition procedures; and\n(b) budget; including proposed funding source\nby designation of the account funding code, estimated cost and basis for\nestimated cost; and\n(c) specifications; completed in accordance with subdivision (o) of this\nsection. (iv)\n\nThe user\ndepartment is responsible for: (a) managing\nall phases of the contract administration procedure; (b) monitoring the performance of the\ncontract to ensure compliance with its terms; and\n(c) the final contract and/or purchase order\nin accordance with authority procedure 2-01-01, as amended from time to\ntime. (3)\n\nEngineering department. (i) The engineering\ndepartment shall serve as the user department for major public work\nprojects. (ii)\n\nThe preparation and\nsubmittal of a requisition shall be required for public work projects which\nhave been developed or identified under board authorization or which have\nreceived State or Federal funding approval. (4)\n\nInternal audit. The internal audit\ndepartment shall have responsibility for evaluating the adequacy and\neffectiveness of internal controls governing the procurement process and for\nproviding cost analysis services upon the request of the procurement department\nand for conducting any necessary audits, such as those required by the Federal\n\nBuy America Act. (5)\n\nOffice of\n\nGeneral Counsel. The Office of General Counsel shall provide interpretations of\nthe procurement guidelines, advice to the user and procurement departments on\nstatutory and regulatory compliance and assist in the board agenda process for\nawards requiring board approval. All issues regarding disqualification and/or\nrelease of a low bidder must be reviewed by the Office of General Counsel prior\nto a decision being made. (6)\nEEO/diversity development will monitor DBE participation for Federal and State\nfunded projects. The EEO/diversity development department will also report DBE\nutilization to appropriate Federal agencies. (b) Evaluating responsiveness and\nresponsibility. (1)\n\nFactors which\nshould be considered by the authority in evaluating responsiveness should\ninclude the following considerations: (i) Has\nall required information been provided?\n(ii)\n\nDoes the bid contain mistakes?\n(iii)\n\nHas bidder failed to commit to a firm\nprice?\n(iv)\n\nAre there unacceptable\nqualifications or conditions tied to the bid?\n(v) Has the bid been prepared in accordance\nwith the bidding instructions?\n(vi)\n\nAre unacceptable provisions included in the bid?\n(vii)\n\nHas the bidder altered or limited any\nof the contract or solicitation provisions?\n(viii)\n\nHas the bidder offered nonconforming\nproducts or services?\n(ix)\n\nHas the\nbidder failed to acknowledge amendments to the IFB issued by the authority?\nNote that the foregoing list is not exhaustive. Minor\ndeviations which are immaterial and do not effect quantity, quality or\ndelivery, may be waived by the authority if such waiver does not prejudice or\naffect the relative standing of the bidders. (2)\n\nIn evaluating the responsibility of an\napparent low bidder or proposed subcontractor, the authority may consider, among other factors, whether the subjects' record with the authority or other\npublic owners includes or demonstrates: (i) being listed on a Federal or State debarred contractors list; (ii)\npoor prior performance on an authority\ncontract; (iii)\nlack of adequate\nexpertise; prior experience with comparable projects; or financial resources\nnecessary to perform the work outlined in the contract in timely, competent and\nacceptable manner. Evidence of such factors may include failure to submit\nsatisfactory evidence of insurance, surety bonds, or financial responsibility; or a history of terminations for cause; (iv)\nengagement in criminal conduct in\nconnection with any other government contracts or the conduct of business\nactivity that involves such crimes as extortion, racketeering, bribery, fraud, bid-rigging and embezzlement; (v) grave disregard for the safety of employees, State personnel, or members of the\npublic. Consideration will be given to whether employees who will be assigned\nto work on the project are properly trained and whether the equipment to be\nused is safe and functioning properly; (vi)\nwillful noncompliance with the State's\n\nLabor Laws regarding prevailing wage and supplement payment requirements, including consideration of any pending violations; (vii)\ndisregard for other State Labor Laws, including child labor, proper and timely wage payments and unemployment\ninsurance laws; (viii)\nviolations\nof the State Workers' Compensation Law including failure to provide proof of\nproper workers' compensation or disability coverage; (ix)\nviolations of the State's Environmental\n\nConservation Law or violations of any other Federal or State environmental\nstatutes; (x) the failure to abide\nby State and Federal statutes and regulations regarding efforts to solicit and\nutilize disadvantaged, minority and women-owned business enterprises as\npotential sub-contractors; (xi)\nthe\nsubmission of a bid which is mathematically or materially unbalanced; (xii)\nthe submission of a bid which is so\nmuch lower than the authority's confidential engineer's estimate that it\nappears unlikely that the contractor will be able to complete the project\nsatisfactorily at the price bid; (xiii)\nthe presentation of false or\nmisleading statements or any other issue that raises serious questions about\nthe responsibility of the bidder or proposed subcontractor. (c) Board\napproval. Board approval is required for each of the following: (1)\nall contracts for goods or services in\nthe actual or estimated value of $100,000 or more; and\n(2)\ncontracts where performance is to\ncontinue for a period in excess of one year. (d) Buy America. (1)\n\nFederal requirements. Procurements which\ninclude Federal funds are subject to Federal Buy America requirements. Generally, this means that steel, iron, and/or manufactured products which are\nincorporated in public works or product purchases are to have been produced in\nthe United States, unless a waiver has been granted by a Federal agency or the\nproject is subject to a general waiver (see, 49 CFR\n661.7\nappendix A) or included in the FAA\nNationwide Buy America Waivers Issued list. General waivers have been\nestablished for microcomputer equipment, including software, and purchases of $\n150,000 or less. (2)\n\nState\nrequirements. (i) Product purchase contracts\ninvolving an estimated expenditure in excess of $50,000 shall require that to\nthe extent such products are made of, fabricated from, or contain steel\ncomponents that such steel components are produced or made in whole or\nsubstantial part in the U.S., its territories or possessions, except in the\nprocurement of motor vehicles and automobile equipment assembled in Canada in\nconformity with the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965 or any amendments\nthereto. (ii)\n\nPublic work projects\nin excess of $100,000 shall require that all structural steel, reinforcing\nsteel or other major steel items to be incorporated in the project shall be\nproduced or made in whole or substantial part in the U.S., its territories or\npossessions. (iii)\n\nBy resolution of\nthe board of commissioners these State provisions may be waived if it is\ndetermined that such provisions would result in unreasonable costs or that such\nsteel products or steel components cannot be produced or made in the U.S. in\nsufficient and reasonably available quantities or of satisfactory quality or\ndesign. (e) Foreign business enterprises. In the event of the award of a contract for goods or services\nfrom a foreign business enterprise in an amount equal to or greater than one\nmillion dollars, simultaneously with notifying the successful bidder or\nproposer, the authority shall notify the NYS Commissioner of Economic\n\nDevelopment of the pending award. The pending contract for goods or services\nshall not be entered in to until at least 15 days have elapsed. However, this\nprovision does not apply to contracts for goods or services awarded on an\nemergency or exigency basis or where a waiver of this requirement has been\nobtained from the NYS Commissioner of Economic Development. The notification to\nthe NYS Commissioner of Economic Development shall include the name, address\nand telephone and facsimile number of the foreign business enterprise, a brief\ndescription of the goods or services to be obtained, the amount and term of the\nproposed contract for goods or services, and the name of the individual at the\nforeign business enterprise or acting on behalf of the same who is principally\nresponsible for the proposed contract for goods or services. Pursuant to\nsection\n2879\nof\nthe Public Authorities Law, the authority shall not enter into a contract for\ngoods or services with a foreign business enterprise which has its principal\nplace of business located in a discriminatory jurisdiction contained on the\nlist prepared by the NYS Commissioner of Economic Development pursuant to\nsubdivision 6 of section\n165\nof the\n\nState Finance Law. The provisions of this subparagraph may be waived by the\nexecutive director if the executive director determines in writing that it is\nin the best interest of the authority to do so. The executive director shall\ndeliver each such waiver to the NYS Commissioner of Economic\n\nDevelopment. (f) Performance security and bonding requirements. (1)\n\nBid security. All public work contracts\nequal to or in excess of $50,000 shall require bid security equal to 10 percent\nof the bid price. Bid security may be in the form of a bid bond, certified\ncheck or other guaranteed negotiable instrument, or letter of credit. The bid\nsecurity of the bidders submitting the three lowest bids will be retained until\nexecution of the contract or a maximum of 180 calendar days after bid opening, whichever is sooner. Bid security of the remaining bidders will be returned\nwithin 10 calendar days after the bid opening date. In the event of neglect or\nrefusal on the part of the successful bidder to execute the contract and\nfurnish evidence of insurances within 10 days after written notification of\nnotice of intent to award the contract, and furnish the performance security\nand labor and material payment bond within three days after receipt of the\nexecuted contract, the entire bid security shall be forfeited to and retained\nby the authority as liquidated damages for such neglect or refusal. Bid\nsecurity is not mandated for product contracts. (2)\n\nPerformance security. All public work\ncontracts of $10,000 or more, shall require a performance bond or certified\ncheck or other guaranteed negotiable instrument or letter of credit\nguaranteeing the contractor's faithful performance. Performance security is not\nmandated for product contracts. In instances where a performance bond is\noffered, the bond shall be in the amount of the contract and be issued by a\nduly incorporated entity authorized to guarantee the faithful performance of\ncontracts and to do business in the State of New York as a surety. (3)\n\nLetter of credit. A letter of credit used\nas bid or performance security should be an irrevocable letter of credit issued\nby a bank or financial institution of B-rating or better, as determined by\n\nMoody's and Standard & Poors, signed by an authorized representative of the\nissuing institution and naming the authority as beneficiary. The letter of\ncredit must state that an amount representing at least 10 percent of the bid\nprice is available to be drawn on unconditionally by the authority under the\nexpressed terms and conditions. These terms and conditions including the\nlocation at which the authority can draw the funds, an effective date, and\nexpiration date should be clearly stated in the letter of credit. (4)\n\nLabor and material payment bonds. All\npublic work contracts, regardless of amount, shall require labor and material\npayment bonds in an amount equal to the contract amount. (5)\n\nMaintenance bonds. All public work\ncontracts, regardless of amount, shall require as a minimum, a one-year\nmaintenance bond, which period shall commence as of the date of final\nacceptance. The maintenance bond shall be in the full contract\namount. (6)\n\nWaiver. (i) Bid and maintenance bond requirements may\nbe waived prior to bid date by the executive director or his designee for\ncause. In instances where such bonds are not required payment shall be withheld\nuntil full and complete performance has been accomplished under the terms of\nthe contract. (ii)\n\nPerformance\nsecurity and labor and material payment bonds may be waived by the executive\ndirector or his designee, prior to the bid date, in accordance with State\n\nFinance Law, section 137(1), provided that the aggregate amount of the contract\nis under $100,000 and that the authority retains 20 percent from each progress\npayment or estimate until the entire contract work has been completed and\naccepted, at which time the executive director or his designee may authorize, pending the payment of the final estimate, the release of up to 75 percent of\nthe retained percentage. (g) Prevailing wage rates. Certain public work contracts maybe subject to the payment of\nprevailing wage rates, regardless of the dollar amount of the contract. It\nshall be the responsibility of the procurement and/or the engineering\ndepartment to obtain the applicable prevailing wage rates for the particular\nprocurement and ensure that the rates are included in the bid solicitation. Generally, projects for construction, reconstruction or maintenance done on\nbehalf of a public entity involving the employment of laborers, workers or\nmechanics are public works. In instances where there is a question regarding\nwhether this condition exists, the Bureau of Public Work will make a\ndetermination based on the particular project details. Generally, agreements\nbetween a contractor and a public entity in which the principal purpose is to\nfurnish services through the use of building service employees are subject to\nprevailing wage rates. A building service employee includes, but is not limited\nto, building cleaner, janitor, gardener, groundskeeper, window cleaner, and\noccupations relating to the collection of garbage or refuse, and to the\ntransportation of office furniture and equipment and the transportation and\ndelivery of fossil fuel. The procurement and engineering departments are\nencouraged to contact the legal department for assistance in the event they are\nuncertain as to the applicability of prevailing rates to a particular\nprocurement. (h) Sealed bidding. (1)\n\nSealed\nbidding is the preferred procurement method for acquisitions of $50,000 or more\nwhere the following factors are present: (i) the contract will be based upon a complete, adequate and realistic\nspecification or purchase description and/or an itemized bid\nproposal; (ii)\ntwo or more\nresponsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the\naward; (iii)\na fair and reasonable\naward can be made principally on the basis of price; and\n(iv)\nthe procurement lends itself to a\nFFP-type contract. (2)\n\nSealed bidding is not required when: (i) the\npurchase is under $50,000 and an informal, small purchase procurement procedure\nis being followed; (ii)\nan\nemergency or exigency exists which renders delay impermissible; (iii)\na single source has been\nvalidated; (iv)\na single bid has\nbeen validated; (v) Federal or\n\nState authorization for noncompetitive negotiations has been\nobtained; (vi)\na modification or\namendment to a contract is justified; (vii)\nthe procurement lends itself to a\nCR-type contract; or\n(viii)\na\nresolution adopted by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members in\nattendance at a meeting of the board states that the board has determined that\nit is not in the best interest of the authority to advertise for\nbids. (3)\n\nMinimum\nrequirements for sealed bidding include: (i) the preparation of an independent estimate prior to bid opening; (ii)\nthe advertisement of an invitation for\nbids (IFB) or a synopsis of a procurement action; (iii)\nthe acceptance of sealed\nbids; (iv)\nthe public opening of\nsealed bids; (v) the preparation of\na written bid analysis; and\n(vi)\nthe award of a FFP type contract to the lowest priced responsive, responsible\nbidder. (4)\n\nIn the event\nof a tied-bid, the contract shall be awarded based upon the following\ndescending order of priorities: (i) small\nbusinesses which are labor surplus area firms; (ii)\nother small businesses; (iii)\nother businesses that are also labor\nsurplus area firms; (iv)\nother\nbusinesses (\ni.e., DBEs, WBEs and MBEs); and\n(v) if two or more bidders still remain\nequally eligible after application of the above order of priority, award shall\nbe made by a drawing by lot limited to those bidders. If time permits, the\nbidders involved shall be given an opportunity to attend the drawing. The\ndrawing shall be witnessed by at least three persons, and the contract file\nshall contain the names and addresses of the witnesses and the person\nsupervising the drawing. (i) Sealed bidding (two-step\nvariation). (1)\n\nThe two-step sealed\nbidding method may be appropriate in instances where the specification is\nfunctional or performance based and there may exist a variety of acceptable\ntechnical approaches. (i) Step one consists\nof the request for, submittal, evaluation, and discussion (optional) of a\ntechnical proposal. For purposes of two-step sealed bidding, this includes\nengineering approach, special manufacturing processes and special testing\ntechniques. No pricing is considered in step one. Discussions may be conducted\nfor clarification of questions relating to technical requirements. (ii)\n\nStep two consists of the submission of\nsealed price bids by those who submitted acceptable technical proposals in step\none. Each bidder's price shall be based on its own technical proposal. If an\naward is made, a FFP-type contract is awarded to the lowest priced responsive, responsible bidder. (j) Negotiation. (1)\n\nProcurement by negotiation is the\npreferred procurement method for acquisitions of $50,000 or more where one or\nmore of the following factors are present: (i) the desired goods or services cannot be\nprecisely defined, described or standardized; (ii)\nthe desired end product is conceptual in\nnature; (iii)\na CR type contract is\ncontemplated; (iv)\ndiscussions\nconcerning the technical aspects and price negotiation are intended; (v) offerors are to be given the opportunity\nto revise the price or technical aspects of their proposal; (vi)\nprice alone cannot be the determinative\nfactor in award. Quality, qualifications, performance data, or other\ncontractual factors are to be considered in selecting the most advantageous\noffering; or\n(vii)\nartistic or\naesthetic values supersede price as primary selection criteria. (2)\n\nProcurement by negotiation is\nnot required when: (i) the purchase is under\n$50,000 and an informal, small purchase procurement procedure is being\nfollowed; (ii)\nan emergency or\nexigency exists which renders delay impermissible; (iii)\na single source award or single bid\naward is validated; (iv)\n\nFederal or\n\nState authorization for noncompetitive procurement has been obtained; (v) a resolution adopted by a vote of at\nleast two-thirds of the members in attendance at a meeting of the board states\nthat the board has determined that it is impractical to advertise for\ncompetitive proposals or it is not in the best interest of the authority to do\nso; or\n(vi)\na modification or\namendment to a contract is justified. (3)\n\nMinimum requirements for negotiation\ninclude: (i) the solicitation of statements of\nqualifications (SOQ) and/or the advertisement of a request for proposals (RFP)\na minimum of 21 days shall be allowed for the preparation of proposals and the\nsetting of the proposal due date; (ii)\nin the event that an SOQ is advertised, preparation of a preselection list of the best qualified consultants, based on\nthe experience and qualification data supplied by the consultants. Generally, the preselection list may consist of between three to five consultants. If\ntechnical proposals were solicited in conjunction with the advertisement, all\nconsultants who submitted responsive proposals must be included for\nevaluation; (iii)\nthe acceptance of\nsealed proposals; (iv)\nthe\nevaluation of the proposals on the basis of published selection\ncriteria; (v) the published\nselection criteria shall be as follows: (a) professional services, 40 percent qualifications and experience, 30 percent\ntechnical criteria and 30 percent cost; (b) revenue generating and other services, 20\npercent qualifications and experience, 30 percent technical criteria and 50\npercent cost; (c) technical/operation sensitive services, 20 percent qualifications and\nexperience, 40 percent technical criteria and 40 percent cost; (d) specialty vehicles, equipment and\ntechnical products, 20 percent qualifications and experience, 50 percent\ntechnical criteria and 30 percent cost; (vi)\nthe preparation of an independent\nestimate before opening the sealed proposal; (vii)\nproposals within the competitive range\nare identified and discussions are held with each proposer; (viii)\nbest and final offers (BAFOs) may be\nrequested of all proposers determined to be within the competitive range or on\nthe short-list; and\n(ix)\nthe\nauthority evaluates BAFOs and awards either a FFP-type or a CR-type contract to\nthe proposer whose BAFO is most advantageous to the authority. (4)\n\nIf so stated in the RFP, selection may be based on the basis of the original proposals, without\ndiscussions with any offeror. However, in the event discussions are conducted\nwith any one offeror, discussions must then be conducted with all offerors in\nthe competitive range. (k) Qualifications-based\nprocurement. (1)\n\nThis method is\nrequired in procuring architectural, engineering, planning and certain related\nservices whenever State or Federal funds will or may be used. There are\ndifferences between the Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Transit\n\nAdministration as to what services are required to be procured in this manner, so reference should be made to the most current version of FAA Advisory\n\nCircular 150/5100-14 E, FTA Advisory Circular 4220.1 For New York State law for\nguidance. (2)\n\nMinimum requirements\nfor a qualifications based procurement include: (i) empaneling of the selection board, consisting of usually at least three qualified members. If the intended\nprocurement is for a GBNRTC/NITTEC study either a GBNRTC/ NITTEC study manager\nor the GBNRTC/NITTEC executive director shall be included on the selection\nboard, as is appropriate for the scope of the study. The selection board shall\nbe prepared to evaluate qualifications, proposals, potential consultants\n(\ni.e., conduct interviews and inquiries as required), and make\nrecommendations. Where a GBNRTC/NITTEC study may not be in the direct interest\nof the authority, the selection board may include representatives from outside\nagencies which have an interest in the study; (ii)\ndevelopment by the selection board, of\nthe selection criteria and the evaluation system to be used in preparing a\npreselection list of consultants, and in determining the final\nselection; (iii)\nthe solicitation\nof qualifications by either advertisement of a request for qualifications (RFQ)\nor by requiring qualifications as part of a request for proposals (RFP)\nadvertisement a minimum of 21 calendar days shall be allowed for the\npreparation of proposals and the setting of the proposal due date; (iv)\nin the event that an RFQ is advertised, preparation of a preselection list of the best qualified consultants, by the\nselection board, based on the experience and qualification data supplied by the\nconsultants. If technical proposals were solicited in conjunction with the\nadvertisement, all consultants who submitted proposals must be included for\nevaluation. Generally, the pre-selection list may consist of between three to\nfive consultants; (v) notification\nto the unsuccessful consultants who expressed an interest; (vi)\nsolicitation of sealed technical\nproposals from each of the consultants; (vii)\nthe selection board, at its option may\nconduct interviews, presentations, and/or discussions. If this option is\nelected, interviews, presentations, and/or discussions must be held with each\nconsultant who has submitted a technical proposal if the initial solicitation\nwas by way of RFQ. If not, interviews, presentations, and/or discussions must\nbe held with each consultant in the competitive range in accordance with the\nevaluation of the technical proposals; (viii)\nevaluation of technical proposals and\nexperience and qualification data based upon published selection criteria of\nwhich price shall not be a factor, rank and identify most qualified\nconsultant; (ix)\ninitiate\ndiscussions with the most qualified, acceptable proposer to develop and agree\nupon the scope of work. Thereafter, the authority prepares its engineer's\nestimate and requests the cost proposal of the most qualified, acceptable\nproposer; (x) upon completion of\nthe engineer's estimate the selection board shall open and review the cost\nproposal. Thereafter, negotiations are undertaken; (xi)\nif a fair and reasonable price cannot be\nreached with the most qualified, acceptable proposer, negotiations are\ncommenced with the next most qualified and acceptable proposer. The cost\nproposal of the next most qualified proposer may be requested only after\nnegotiations with the most qualified proposer have been formally terminated. This process shall be repeated until the successful negotiation of a fair and\nreasonable contract price for an acceptable proposal from a qualified proposer\nis reached, or until the procurement is discontinued; (xii)\nin accordance with the requirements of\n\nNew York Public Authorities Law section 2879(3)(b)(iv) the authority will not\nrefuse to negotiate with a professional firm solely because the ratio of the\nallowable indirect costs to direct labor costs of the professional firm or the\nhourly rate in any labor category of the professional firm exceeds a\nlimitation, generally set by the authority in the determination of the\nreasonableness of the estimated cost of services to be rendered by the\nprofessional firm but rather the authority should also consider the\nreasonableness of cost based on the total estimated cost of the service of the\nprofessional firm which should include, among other things, all the direct\nlabor costs of the professional firm for such services, plus all allowable\nindirect costs, other direct costs and negotiated profit of the professional\nfirm. A\nprofessional firm\nis defined for the purpose of this\nsubparagraph as any legal entity permitted by law to practice the professions\nof architecture, engineering or surveying; and\n(xiii)\nsubmittal of written and documented\nrecommendation for award by the selection board to the board of commissioners\nwhen required. In addition, the GBNRTC/NITTEC studies documentation of the\nselection board's recommendation for award will be maintained at the\nGBNRTC/NITTEC offices and will be available to interested parties. (l) Options. An option is a unilateral right in a contract by which, for a\nspecified time, the authority may acquire additional equipment, supplies, or\nservices than originally procured. An option may also extend the term of the\ncontract. An option must be evaluated as part of the original contract award. In addition, for procurements funded by the Federal Transit Administration, a\ncost and price analysis must be conducted at the time of exercise of the option\nin order to ensure that the option price is still fair and reasonable. (m) New York State Contract\n\nReporter. All procurements of goods or services having an actual or\nestimated value of $50,000 or more shall be published in the\n\nNew York\n\nState Contract Reporter (NYSCR). The notice of procurement opportunity\nshall appear in the NYSCR at least 15 business days prior to the bid or\nproposal due date. However, advance publication shall not be required under\nemergency or exigency conditions, or when an expediency action has been adopted\nby the board, or if the procurement is being solicited within 45 business days\nafter the date bids or proposals were originally due. At the time a\ndetermination of intent to award a procurement contract is made, the following\ninformation shall be submitted for publication in NYSCR: for procurement\ncontracts obtained through the sealed bidding process, the result of the bid\nopening including the names of bidding firms and the amounts bid by each; for\nprocurement contracts obtained through the negotiation and/or\nqualification-based processes, the names of firms submitting proposals and the\nproposal selected as the best value offer; and for all other procurement\ncontracts, the name of the proposed awardee. (n) Sole-source awards. (1)\nA sole source award shall not be\njustified on the basis of: (i) a lack of\nadvance planning by the initiating department; or\n(ii)\nconcerns related to the amount of funds\navailable (\ni.e., funds will expire) to the authority for the\nacquisition of supplies or services. (2)\nA sole-source award is justified under\ncircumstances limited to the following: (i) a\nvalidated \"single bid\"; (ii)\nemergency (subdivision [lx] of this section); (iii)\nexigency (subdivision [lx] of this\nsection); (iv)\nexpediency (waiver\nof competition, for cause, by a two-thirds vote of the board of commissioners)\n(subdivision [y] of this section); or\n(v) a validated \"single source\" (paragraph\n[4] of this subdivision). A cost or price analysis must be prepared for all sole source\nawards in accordance with FTA guidelines.
