  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 220-3.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose\nof this Subpart, the general definitions of Part 200 and Part 201 of this Title\napply. (b) For the purpose of this\n\nSubpart, the following definitions also apply: (1)\n'Aggregate.' Any hard, inert material\nused for mixing in graduated particles or fragments, including sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag, recycled asphalt, rock dust or powder. (2)\n'Asphalt Cement.' A material that is used\nto bind aggregate into asphalt mixture, as defined in this Subpart. Asphalt\ncements can be modified to meet different criteria, such as, but not limited\nto, hot and warm mix applications. (3)\n'Asphalt Cement Storage Tank and Heater.'\nA storage tank where asphalt cement is stored and heated before it is\ntransferred to the mixer. (4)\n'Asphalt Mixture Manufacturing Plant.' A facility comprised of one or more\n\nAsphalt Mixture Processing Units used to produce asphalt mixture, including but\nnot limited to storage silos, asphalt cement tanks, etc. (5)\n'Asphalt Mixture Processing Unit.' A\ncontinuous drum or batch mix process, including, but not limited to, a\nbaghouse, drag conveyor, aggregate dryer, storage silo and/or a hot screen pug\nmill assembly with truck load out. An Asphalt Mixture Processing Unit can be\neither stationary or portable. (6)\n'Asphalt Mixture.' The mixture of hot, dried aggregate, with or without\nrecycled asphalt paving material, and heated asphalt cement; or cold mixture\nmaterial produced using aggregates and asphalt emulsion at ambient temperatures\nthat meets the required specifications. (7)\n'Asphalt Storage Silo.' A structure that\nstores finished, heated, asphalt mixture before it is loaded into\ntrucks. (8)\n'Batch Mix Process.' An\n\nAsphalt Mixture Processing Unit that heats the aggregate, screens out the\noversized aggregate, and stores the hot aggregate prior to blending the asphalt\ncement and the aggregates in a mixer. (9)\n'Blue Smoke.' Emissions of semi-volatile\norganic hydrocarbon compounds and inorganic particulate matter, classified as\n\nPolycyclic Organic Matter (POM), that condenses at atmospheric temperatures. These compounds can diffract light and create an associated air emission with\nblueish color. (10)\n'Calculated\n\nAnnual Production Level.' A calculated value determined by taking the average\nof the three highest manufacturing calendar years of asphalt Mixture from the\nprevious five most recent calendar years at an Asphalt Mixture Processing Unit, looking back from the effective date of this Subpart, and continued on a\nrolling basis thereafter. Once an Asphalt Mixture Processing Unit exceeds a\nthreshold for requiring controls, those controls must remain in place and\ncontinue to operate regardless of future calculated production\nlevels. (11)\n'Continuous Drum Mix\n\nProcess.' An Asphalt Mixture Processing Unit that heats aggregate and mixes it\nwith asphalt cement. (12)\n'Drag\n\nSlat Conveyor.' A conveyor commonly used in a continuous mix facility to\ntransport asphalt mixture from a drum mixer to storage silos. Drag slat\nconveyors are sometimes called by other names such as slat conveyor and drag\nconveyors. (13)\n'Existing Asphalt\n\nMixture Manufacturing Plant.' An asphalt Mixture manufacturing plant that has\nhad process operations in any calendar year prior to the effective date of this\n\nSubpart. (14)\n'Low\nNO\nx\n\nBurner.' A burner designed to emit nitrogen oxides\n(NO\nx\n) at or below the limits specified in section\n220-3.5 of this Subpart. (15)\n'New\n\nAsphalt Mixture Manufacturing Plant.' An Asphalt Mixture Manufacturing Plant\nwhere a permit application for the construction of the plant was received by\nthe department after the effective date of this Subpart. Units meeting the\ndefinition of Reconstructed Asphalt Mixture Processing Units shall be\nconsidered new units. (16)\n'Operation.' Those days, weeks, or months of the calendar year where asphalt\nmixture is being produced and/or sold. (17)\n'Pug Mill.' An apparatus used for mixing\nthe ingredients of hot and warm mix asphalt mixture. Typical units contain\nshafts with mixing paddles that rotate. Hot, dry materials enter from above and\na spray bar injects asphalt cement into the mill. These components are mixed\nprior to being loaded into a transport vehicle. (18)\n'Reclaimed or Recycled Asphalt Pavement\n(RAP).' Asphalt Mixture reclaimed from roads, parking lots, or other sources\nthat is then reprocessed either by itself or with virgin feed. (19)\n'Reconstructed Asphalt Mixture\n\nProcessing Unit.' The replacement of components of an existing unit to such an\nextent that the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of\nthe fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable new\nsource. (20)\n'Warm Mix Asphalt.'\nAsphalt Mixture that is produced by mixing heated aggregate with asphalt cement\nand manufactured at temperatures below those that produce blue smoke as\ndetermined by 40 CFR Part\n60, Appendix A-4, Method 9, or other means of\ntesting. The asphalt cement includes additional binding materials and\nadditives, including but not limited to wax, emulsions, surfactants and\nzeolites for easier pouring and spreading at reduced temperatures.
