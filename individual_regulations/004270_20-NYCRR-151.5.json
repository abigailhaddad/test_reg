  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 151.5 - Claims for refund or credit-New York State income tax return required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every taxpayer\nwho claims a refund or credit of New York State personal income tax withheld, or of New York State estimated income tax paid during the year, must file a New\n\nYork State income tax return to obtain any such refund or credit, even though\nsuch taxpayer would not otherwise be required to do so. A taxpayer who is not\nrequired to file a New York State personal income tax return under paragraph\n(a)(1) or (3) of section\n151.2\nof this Part, and who files a Federal income tax return only to obtain a refund\nor credit of Federal income tax overpaid, is not required to file a New York\n\nState personal income tax return unless such taxpayer claims a refund or credit\nof New York State income tax also. For example, a single individual whose\n\nFederal gross income for the taxable year 1986 is $4,000 or less ($2,500 or\nless for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971 and before January 1, 1986), from which only Federal income tax was withheld, but no New York State\npersonal income tax, may be required to file a Federal income tax return to\nobtain a refund of the Federal income tax withheld. However, if such individual\nwas a resident of New York State for the entire taxable year, such individual\nwould not be required to file a New York State personal income tax return if\nsuch individual meets all of the following conditions for the taxable year: (1)\nsuch individual's New York adjusted gross\nincome for the taxable year is $4,000 or less; (2)\nsuch individual did not have any New York\nitems of tax preference in excess of the specific deduction; (3)\nsuch individual was not subject to the\nseparate tax upon the termination of a qualified higher education fund; and\n(4)\nsuch individual was not\nsubject to the separate tax on the ordinary income portion of a lump sum\ndistribution. See section\n151.2\n(a)(1)\nof this Part with respect to the conditions referred to in this section. (b) Where a taxpayer is\nnot required to file a New York State personal income tax return for the\ntaxable year and such taxpayer qualifies for a refundable credit under section\n606 (e)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsection\n106.5\nof this Title) or section 606-A of the Tax Law (for year in effect), in order\nto obtain the refund of such credit, such individual must file the New York\n\nState Claim for Real Property Tax Credit (form IT-214) or the New York State\n\nClaim for Energy Assistance Credit (form IT-216). Such form will be considered\nas a claim for refund. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n151.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
