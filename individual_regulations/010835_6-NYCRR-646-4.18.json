  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-4.18 - Stormwater management plan requirements for developed areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, section 43-0112(2) the commission shall prepare\na study of the feasibility of reducing the impacts of stormwater runoff in\nareas where development has already occurred. The recommendations of such study\nshall be incorporated into stormwater management plans and stormwater\nregulatory programs. Municipalities nevertheless should identify, early in the\nplanning process, geographic areas and land-based activities requiring\nattention to alleviate adverse stormwater related impacts upon water quality\nand erosion. Municipalities are also encouraged to begin to consider policies\nand methods to address such impacts prior to completion of the study. (b) The plan may include in relation to such\ngeographic areas and land-based activities: (1)\na description and location of major\nstormwater outfall points; (2)\nan\nanalysis of existing data on flows and pollutants discharged from major\nstormwater outfalls and an evaluation of the need to gather additional data in\norder to: (i) establish baseline levels of\nelements and compounds being discharged at major stormwater out falls; and\n(ii)\nrank major stormwater\noutfalls in order of the amount, levels and volume of stormwater and pollutant\nloads being discharged; (3)\nspecific objectives which can reasonably\nbe expected to be undertaken by State and local government to reduce or prevent\nany increase in stormwater runoff and stormwater pollution from new development\nor redevelopment. In setting specific objectives, the plan shall evaluate the\nfollowing: (i) construction of new stormwater\nmanagement facilities such as siltation traps, catch basins, and/or retention\nponds, independently, or as part of any public road project or other\ndevelopment; (ii)\nimproved\nmaintenance of existing stormwater management facilities; (iii)\ntargets for reduction in volume of road\ndeicing sand and salts; (iv)\nimprovements in runoff controls at road sand and salt storage areas; (v) reduction in the volume of fertilizers\nand pesticides applied to public and private lands; (vi)\naction to improve spring cleanup of road\nsand and salt including identification of suitable disposal sites; (vii)\nalteration of existing stormwater\nfacilities to reduce the volume of stormwater mixed with surface water flows\nfrom the undeveloped upland thereby reducing the volume of polluted water to be\ncontrolled; (viii)\naction to\nstabilize eroding areas such as road banks, stream crossing sites, sand and\ngravel mines; and\n(ix)\naction to\nimprove street sweeping, litter and lawn clipping and other housekeeping\nmeasures; and\n(4)\nan\nidentification of ponds and wetlands and areas of watercourses now receiving\nstormwater and an evaluation of their potential to absorb additional stormwater\nflows and pollutants without undue adverse impacts to the wetland or\nwatercourse.
