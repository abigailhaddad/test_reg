  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 79.3 - Tax due on inventory based on increased cigarette tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 471 and 475\n(a) Effective June 3, 2008, amendments made\nby part RR-1 of chapter 57 of the Laws of 2008 to section 471 of article 20 of\nthe Tax Law increased the tax on cigarettes possessed in New York State by any\nperson for sale from $1.50 to $2.75 for each 20 cigarettes or fraction thereof. Provided, however, if a package of cigarettes contains more than 20 cigarettes, the rate of tax on those cigarettes in excess of 20 increased from 371/2 cents\nto 683/4 cents for each five cigarettes or fraction thereof. (b) Every dealer of cigarettes, including\nagents licensed to purchase and affix stamps, shall take a physical inventory\nof all cigarettes possessed in this State as of the close of business on June\n2, 2008. In addition, every dealer who is a licensed agent shall take a\nphysical inventory of all unaffixed cigarette tax stamps possessed as of the\nclose of business on such date. Because it may be impossible to take a physical\ninventory of cigarettes in all vending machines that are on location throughout\nthe State, a dealer may take as many physical inventories of the contents of\nsuch machines as is possible with available personnel. For those machines that\ncannot be physically inventoried as of the close of business on June 2, 2008, cigarettes may be accounted for at one-half of the normal fill capacities of\nsuch machines, as reflected in the individual inventory records maintained for\nsuch machines. (c) Returns\nand payments. (1)\n(i) On or before August 20, 2008, every such\ndealer shall file a return with the Department of Taxation and Finance, on a\nform prescribed by the department for such purpose, showing the quantity of all\ncigarettes and unaffixed stamps possessed as of the June 2, 2008, close of\nbusiness inventory. Such return must reflect the entire wholesale and/or retail\ninventories of the dealer within the State, as required by the department, regardless of the number of business locations of the dealer. Except as\nprovided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, every dealer shall pay, with\nthe filing of such return, an additional amount of tax for all cigarettes in\nsuch inventory which are contained in packages bearing stamps evidencing tax\npayment at the rates in effect prior to June 3, 2008, and for all unaffixed\ncigarette tax stamps in such inventory evidencing tax payment at such rates. The additional amount of tax shall be paid at the rate of $1.25 for each 20\ncigarettes or fraction thereof unless cigarettes are contained in packages of\nmore than 20, in which case the additional amount of tax for those cigarettes\nin excess of 20 shall be at the rate of 311/4cents for each five cigarettes or\nfraction thereof ($1.5625 per package of 25 cigarettes). Such tax shall be paid\nregardless of whether the affixed or unaffixed stamps show payment of the New\n\nYork State tax or both the New York State and City of New York taxes. (ii)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Title to the contrary, a dealer who has additional amount of tax due on\ninventory based on the increased cigarette tax may elect to pay such tax in two\ninstallments. The first installment is due with the filing of the return on or\nbefore August 20, 2008, and shall not be less than 25 percent of the entire\nadditional amount of tax due. Provided, however, in no event shall such\ninstallment be less than $500 or the entire additional amount of cigarette tax\ndue, if less than $500. Thus a dealer having an additional amount of tax due on\ninventory based on the increased cigarette tax of $400 would be liable for the\nfull payment on August 20, 2008; a dealer having such a liability of $1,000\nwould be liable for a first installment of at least $500; and a dealer having\nsuch a liability of $10,000 would be liable for a first installment of at least\n$2,500 ($10,000 x 25 percent). The second and final installment must be paid to\nthe department on or before December 22, 2008, and must be accompanied by a\nfinal payment document prescribed by the department for this purpose. Where the\ndepartment has cause to believe that the final installment of the additional\namount of tax due on inventory may be jeopardized by delay, the department may\nrequire such payment at any time prior to December 22, 2008. (See subdivision\n[d] of this section for sanctions concerning untimely installments.)\n(2)\n\nThe additional amount of tax\ndue on inventory based on the increased cigarette tax and any applicable\ninstallment should be paid by check or money order, payable to NYS Cigarette\n\nTax. (d) (1)\n\nFailure to file a return on cigarette and\ncigarette tax stamp inventory or to pay the additional amount of tax due\nthereon, or failure to comply with any provision of this section may result in\ncivil or criminal sanctions, or both. (2)\n\nIn the case of any dealer who elects to\npay the additional amount of tax due in installments, as described in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, if the required first installment is not\nproperly paid on or before August 20, 2008, the entire additional amount of tax\nshall be due and owing, and any civil penalty and interest imposed pursuant to\nsection\n481\nof the Tax Law and Part 78 of this Title\nwill accrue from such date on the entire tax liability that remains unpaid. Where the required first installment is timely paid but any portion of the\nsecond and final installment is paid after December 22, 2008, any civil penalty\nand interest so imposed will accrue from such date on the unpaid\nbalance.
