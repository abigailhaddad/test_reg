  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 431.9 - Termination of parental rights by local social services agency\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as\nrequired in subdivision (e) of this section, each social services official\nmust, at six months from removal and every six months thereafter, evaluate the\nstatus of the relationship, of each child in direct or purchased foster care\nwith his/her natural family in order to determine whether the interests of the\nchild will be served through termination of the parent's legal rights to\nguardianship and custody of the child. If it is determined that termination of\nthe rights of the parent(s) would be in the child's best interests, or if, following a Family Court permanency hearing held under article 10-A of the\n\nFamily Court Act, there is a court order directing that a proceeding to\nterminate parental rights be instituted, the social services official must take\nappropriate steps to promptly initiate essential procedures to terminate\nparental rights. (b) In making a\ndetermination to terminate parental rights in accordance with subdivision (a)\nof this section, the social services official must consider: (1)\nwhether there are indications of parental\nrejection of the child, which may include the failure of the parent(s) since\nthe child was removed or the most recent permanency hearing to: (i) request visits with the child; (ii)\ncooperate with the agency in planning\nand arranging visits with the child, although physically and financially\nable; (iii)\ncommunicate with the\nchild regularly by phone or letter if there is physical or financial inability\nto visit; (iv)\nkeep appointments to\nvisit child as arranged; (v) keep\nthe agency informed as to his or her whereabouts; (vi)\nkeep appointments with agency staff\nwhich may have been arranged to assist the parent with those problems which\naffect the parent's ability to care for the child; (vii)\nuse community resources as arranged or\nsuggested by the agency, or ordered by the court, or other involved agencies to\nresolve or correct the problems which impair parental ability to care for the\nchild; (viii)\ndemonstrate a\nwillingness and capacity to plan for the child's discharge, including taking\nwhat steps are necessary to provide an adequate, safe and stable home and\nparental care for the child within a reasonable period of time; (2)\nwhether there are indications\nthat efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship would not be\nin the child's best interests as evidenced by: (i) addiction to alcohol or drugs to such a\ndegree that the parent's ability to function in a mature and reasonable manner\nis impaired, or anti-social behavior to a degree that the parent is frequently\nincarcerated; (ii)\nconsistent\nexpressed hostility towards the child or evidence of neglect and/or abuse\nduring periods when the child has visited the parent; (iii)\nconsistent expressed resistance on the\npart of a child, judged to be of sufficient maturity and intelligence to make\nsuch judgment, to accept visits from the parent, or resistance on the part of a\nsmall child without sufficient maturity or judgment who exhibits resistance or\ndefensive behavior; e.g., continual crying when parents visit, bedwetting, compulsive scratching, nervous habits, only evident when child is with parents\nbut not evident in everyday behavior in the foster home; (iv)\nthe parent's mental illness, manifested\nby a disorder or disturbance in behavior, feeling, thinking or judgment to such\nan extent that if the child were returned to the custody of the parent, the\nchild would be in danger of becoming a neglected child as defined in the Family\n\nCourt Act; (v) the parent's mental\nretardation, manifested by impairment in adaptive behavior to such an extent\nthat if such child were returned to the custody of the parent the child would\nbe in danger of becoming a neglected child as defined in the Family Court\n\nAct. (c) If\nthe social services official determines that the interests of the child would\nbe best served by terminating parental rights and petitioning for the\nguardianship and custody of the child, he or she must: (1)\nrequire that a caseworker on his or her\nstaff, or on the staff of the agency having direct care of the child, interview\nthe parents, parent, or legal guardian in order to discuss the future needs of\nthe child for care, parental affection, safety and security, and determine\nwhether the parent, parents or guardian will voluntarily surrender the\nguardianship and custody of the child, and accept such surrender as agreed. If\nsuch agreement cannot be reached with the parent, parents or guardian, clearly\nindicate to such parent, parents or guardian the steps which the agency may\ntake or have been ordered to take in order to obtain a court commitment of\nguardianship and custody; (2)\nrequire that there be documentation in the child's case record of all evidence\nwhich indicates the need to ask the court to grant the agency guardianship and\ncustody of the child; and\n(3)\nobtain whatever legal counsel is necessary in order to prepare a petition, which must be presented to the proper court as soon as possible but in no case\nmore than 30 days following a determination that it is in the best interests of\nthe child to terminate parental rights, unless there are serious extenuating\ncircumstances which in the opinion of the local commissioner justify a special\nextension. (d) Denying\nor limiting parental visitation. Prior to or concurrent with the initiation of\na proceeding to terminate parental rights, if it is deemed to be in the child's\nbest interests to deny or limit the right of the parent or parents to visit, and if such parent or parents will not voluntarily agree to such a limitation\nor discontinuance of visiting, a social services official must seek court\napproval of such decision to limit or deny to the parents the right to visit, provided legal grounds for such action exists under article 10 or 10-A of the\n\nFamily Court Act. (e) (1)\nA social services district must file a\npetition to terminate parental rights or if such a petition has been filed by\nanother party, seek to be joined as a party to such petition if one of the\nfollowing events occurs: (i) the child has\nbeen in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months; (ii)\na court of competent jurisdiction has\ndetermined the child to be an abandoned child; or\n(iii)\na court of competent jurisdiction has\nmade a determination that the parent has been convicted of: the murder or\nvoluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent; the attempt, facilitation, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit such a murder or\nmanslaughter; or a felony assault that resulted in serious bodily injury to the\nchild or to another child of the parent. (2)\nA social services district is not\nrequired to file a petition to terminate parental rights as set forth in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision if based on a case-by-case determination: (i) the child is being cared for by a\nrelative, provided, however, nothing in this section precludes a social\nservices district from filing a petition to terminate parental rights when such\npetition is in the best interests of the child; (ii)\nthe social services district has\ndocumented in the case plan available for court review a compelling reason for\ndetermining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of\nthe child and, for the purposes of this section, a compelling reason would\ninclude, but not be limited to: (a) the child\nwas placed into foster care pursuant to article 3 or 7 of the Family Court Act\nand a review of the specific facts and circumstances of the child's placement\ndemonstrate that the appropriate permanency goal for the child is either: (1)\nreturn to his or her parent or guardian; or\n(2)\ndischarge to another planned\nliving arrangement with a permanency resource; (b) where adoption is not the appropriate\npermanency goal for the child; (c) the child is 14 years of age or older and will not consent to his or her\nadoption; (d) the child is the\nsubject of a pending disposition under article 10 of the Family Court Act, except where such child is already in the custody of the Commissioner of Social\n\nServices as a result of a proceeding other than the pending article 10\nproceeding and a review of the specific facts and circumstances of the child's\nplacement demonstrate that the appropriate permanency goal for the child is\ndischarge to his or her parent or guardian; (e) there are insufficient grounds for filing\na petition to terminate parental rights; or\n(iii)\nthe social services district has not\nprovided the family of the child, consistent with the time period in the\nservice plan of the child, such services as the social services district deems\nnecessary for the safe return of the child to the child's family, consistent\nwith the provisions of section\n430.12\nof this Title unless such\nservices are not legally required. (3)\n\nWhenever a social services district\ndetermines that a petition to terminate parental rights must be filed in\naccordance with the provisions of this subdivision, the social services\ndistrict must also make reasonable efforts to identify, recruit, process and\napprove a qualified family for the adoption of the child, if such steps have\nnot already taken place. (4)\n\nWhen a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction has made a determination that a child is\nabandoned in accordance with subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision or where\na court of competent jurisdiction has made a determination that a parent has\nbeen convicted of the criminal offenses set forth in subparagraph (1)(iii) of\nthis subdivision, the social services district must file a petition to\nterminate parental rights or seek to be joined in a pending proceeding within\n60 days of such court determination, unless one of the exceptions set forth in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision apply.
