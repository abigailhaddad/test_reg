(7)\nA business plan containing such\ninformation as shall permit the superintendent to make a finding that the\ngranting of the license will promote the convenience and advantage of the area\nin which the business is to be conducted including a determination that there\nis a community need for a new licensee in the proposed area to be served.

(8)\n\nIn the case of an application for a new\nlicense, a copy of the deed to the property on which the check cashing business\nwill be conducted or a copy of the contract to purchase such property or, if\nthe proposed licensed location is leased or to be leased, a copy of the lease\nor proposed lease or letter from the owner or its agent that the applicant has\nobtained or will obtain possession of the proposed licensed location.

For a change of control\napplication wherein succession to the licensee's business premises does not\noccur by operation of law, the applicant shall provide evidence to the\nsatisfaction of the superintendent that the lease(s) for the licensed locations\nwill be assigned or sublet to the applicant or that a new lease(s) will be\ngiven the applicant if the applicant is not purchasing the property. All\nlicensed locations except for limited stations and mobile units must include\nthe dimensions of the location and a diagram of the proposed layout with the\napplication.

Comments or\nobjections regarding the application should be submitted in writing to the\nsuperintendent within 10 business days of the date of publication. (e) Determination. The superintendent shall\nmake a determination on the granting of a license within 90 days after the\nreceipt of all information and documents required by this Part. (f) If an application for change of control\nis approved by the superintendent, a new license is granted to the applicant in\ncases in which the name of the licensee is changed. However, although section\n369\n(1)\nof the Banking Law indicates that no\nlicense shall be granted in such cases, where the licensee is located within\nthree-tenths of a mile of another licensee, the legislative intent, as\nexpressed in chapter 546 of the Laws of 1994 and set forth in section\n400.15\nof this Part, is consistent\nwith the granting of licenses in all cases in which there is a change of\ncontrol of an existing licensee. Consequently, an applicant may acquire control\nof a licensee and change the name of the licensee even if the licensee being\nacquired is located within three-tenths of a mile of another\nlicensee. (g) The license of a\nrestricted location authorized pursuant to subdivision 1 of section\n369\nof the Banking\n\nLaw shall not be affected by a change of control, pursuant to section\n370-a\nof the\n\nBanking Law, pertaining solely to such restricted location of such licensee, provided that the licensee continues thereafter to engage at that location in\nthe cashing of checks, drafts or money orders only for payees that are other\nthan natural persons and provided further that such license shall bear a legend\nstating that such location is restricted to the cashing of checks, drafts or\nmoney orders only for payees that are other than natural persons.
