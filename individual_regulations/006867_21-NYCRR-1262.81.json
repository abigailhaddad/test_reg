(1)\n\nEvery omnibus shall\nbe equipped with brakes adequate to control the movement of and to stop and to\nhold such omnibus. Two separate means of brake application shall be provided, one of which shall be an emergency brake applied manually or by spring action. These two separate means of applying the brakes, shall be so constructed that\nfailure of any one part of the operating mechanism shall not leave the omnibus\nwithout operative brakes. (2)\n\nEvery\nomnibus shall have separate mechanical emergency brakes, manually operated, capable of stopping the vehicle at a rate of deceleration equivalent to a stop\nwithin 75 feet from a speed of 20 miles per hour. (3)\n\nOmnibus service brakes shall be power\ntype brakes, shall operate on all four wheels and shall be capable of producing\na smooth stop at a rate of deceleration equivalent to a stop within 22.2 feet\nfrom a speed of 20 miles per hour. (4)\n\nEvery omnibus equipped with airbrakes, hydraulic power brake system with accumulator, vacuum power brakes or vacuum\noperated doors shall have a reservoir of sufficient capacity to furnish power\nfor at least two operations of the brakes and two operations of the doors or\nother power operated devices after the engine has stopped. (5)\n\nEvery omnibus equipped with airbrakes or\nhydraulic power systems with accumulator shall have a non-glare illuminated\ngauge, clearly visible to the driver, to indicate the pressure in the\nreservoir. Also, there shall be a device which will give a distinctive audible\nor visible warning signal when the pressure in the reservoir accumulator is\ninsufficient to activate any power operated device on the omnibus. (6)\n\nPower brakes shall not be equipped with\nany device which, upon application, reduces the braking effort in such a manner\nas to prevent compliance with the specifications of this subdivision. (b) Lights. (1)\n\nInterior lighting in all omnibuses shall\nbe designed and shielded so as to minimize reflection and glare on the\nwindshield. (2)\n\nAll omnibuses shall\nbe equipped with one of the following stalled warning signal systems: (i) Three red emergency electric lanterns\nor\n(ii)\n\nCircuitry that permits\nfront and rear identification lights to blink or\n(iii)\n\nCircuitry that permits turn-signal\nlights on both sides, front and rear, to blink, simultaneously.

(f) Dimensions. An omnibus may not exceed the following over-all\ndimensions: (1)\n\nLength-40 feet, 0\ninches\n(2)\n\nWidth-8 feet, 6\ninches\n(3)\n\nHeight-11 feet, 0\ninches\n(g) Chassis. (1)\n\nOn all omnibuses the\nrear overhang shall not exceed 7/24ths of the over-all length of omnibus\nmeasured from the center line of rear axle. (2)\n\nOmnibus (except sedan type chassis frame\nextensions) are prohibited and the body will not extend more than 15 inches\nbeyond the rear of the main frame supporting the body. (3)\n\nOmnibuses carrying more than 21 adult\npassengers shall be provided with an aisle that shall extend from the rear edge\nof the front entrance door to and not terminate forward of the back of the\nsecond seat from the rear, and shall be: (i) 75 inches from floor to ceiling. (ii)\n14 inches minimum clear width. (4)\n\nAll omnibuses shall have\nadequate metal guards installed at the forward end of each section of the\ndriveshaft and also at the rear end of each section where necessary, to prevent\nthe shaft from dropping to the ground or whipping through the floor or causing\ndamage to the brakes, fuel and exhaust systems in case it breaks or becomes\ndisconnected. (5)\n\nAll omnibuses, except sedan type, shall mount heavy duty towing hooks suitably attached to the\nframe of the vehicle both front and rear. (h) Entrance and exits. (1)\n\nIn all omnibuses all doors shall be\ndesigned and constructed as to prevent accidental opening. Except in sedan type\nomnibuses all such vehicles having an additional entrance-exit door rearward of\nthe front door shall be equipped with an audible or visible signal indicating\ndoor is not completely closed. Door controls shall be readily accessible to the\ndriver. (2)\n\nAll omnibuses, except\nsedan type, shall be provided with an emergency door which must be located on\nthe left side to the rear of the center of the passenger section, or at the\nrear center, with an aligned passageway from the main aisle to the door except\nthat approved type \"push-out\" windows may be substituted in lieu thereof with\nthe following minimum required: (i) 10-19\npassengers-1 on each side\n(ii)\n20-29 passengers-2 on each side\n(iii)\n30-39 passengers-3 on each\nside\n(iv)\nover 39 passengers-4 on\neach side\n(3)\n\nThese\nminimum requirements are reduced by one push-out window on the right side in\nall omnibuses having a separate exit door operable by a passenger from the\ninside in an emergency. Such an exit service door may be substituted for an\nemergency exit door in all omnibuses having a seating capacity of less than 30\nadult passengers. (4)\n\nThe following\nminimum allowable dimensions shall apply to entrance-exits: Height\n\nWidth\n\nEmergency exit door....... 48\"\n18\"\nEmergency passageways....... 48\"\n12\"\nEmergency exit push-out window....... 17\"\n24\"\nRegular entrance-exit doors (where adult\npassenger seating capacity exceeds 21)....... 72'\n24\"\n(5)\n\nIn all omnibuses emergency doors shall be\nmaintained in proper operating condition and both door and passageway thereto\nshall be unobstructed. (6)\n\nEmergency doors in all omnibuses shall have an adequate three point locking\ndevice equipped with an operating handle designed and constructed to release\neasily, but not accidentally, to open the door from the inside.

(3)\n\nAn omnibus equipped with a heater\ndesigned to draw air from the outside shall have intakes for free air located\nforward of the rear axle, except in an omnibus having the engine located at the\nrear end, such air intakes shall be located forward of the center of the\npassenger section. Heaters and hot water lines installed within the passenger\nsection shall be shielded, where necessary, to prevent injury to the driver and\npassengers in case any part thereof breaks, leaks or becomes\ndisconnected. (4)\n\nEvery omnibus\nshall be equipped with a system of ventilation capable of distributing an\nadequate supply of free air throughout the passenger section. (5)\n\nOn all omnibuses air intakes and exhaust\nvents for the ventilation system, other than air conditioning system or a power\nexhaust vent which operated constantly when the engine is running, shall be\nlocated forward of the center of the passenger section and not below the floor\nline. If equipped with a power ventilation system it shall be controlled power\ntype system. (j) Mirrors. All omnibuses, sedan type excepted, shall be equipped\nwith at least two mirrors, one on each side of the\nbody. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
