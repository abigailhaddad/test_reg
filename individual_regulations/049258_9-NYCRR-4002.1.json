When so\ninstructed by the commission, the applicant shall file with the application\nfingerprints and photographs in requisite number. The fingerprints so obtained\nshall be transmitted by the commission to the New York State Identification and\n\nIntelligence System, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Identification\n\nDivision, and any other government agency of any state or country selected by\nthe commission, for the purpose of establishing identity and previous criminal\nrecord, if any, of the applicant.
