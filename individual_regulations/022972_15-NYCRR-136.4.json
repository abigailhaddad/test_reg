(b) (1)\n\nAn application for a driver's license may\nbe denied if a review of the entire driving history provides evidence that the\napplicant constitutes a problem driver, as defined in section\n136.1\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Part. If an application is denied pursuant to this paragraph, no\napplication shall be considered for a minimum of one year from the date of\ndenial. In lieu of such denial, the applicant may be issued a license or permit\nwith a problem driver restriction, as set forth in section\n3.2\n(c)(4)\nof this\n\nTitle and paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nUpon the approval of an application for\nrelicensing of a person who is deemed a problem driver under this subdivision, the commissioner may impose a problem driver restriction on such person's\nlicense or permit, as set forth in section\n3.2\n(c)(4)\nof this\n\nTitle. As a component of this restriction, the commissioner may require such\nperson to install an ignition interlock device in any motor vehicle owned or\noperated by such person. The ignition interlock requirement will be noted on\nthe attachment to the driver license or permit held by such person. Such\nattachment must be carried at all times with the driver license or\npermit. (3)\n(i) Revocation of license or permit with\nproblem driver restriction. A license or permit that contains a problem driver\nrestriction shall be revoked: (a) upon the\nholder's conviction of a traffic violation or combination of violations, committed while such restriction is in effect, which the Commissioner deems\nserious in nature; or\n(b) for the\nholder's failure to install and maintain an ignition interlock device in motor\nvehicles owned or operated by the holder, when required to do so under such\nrestriction. The attachment, provided for in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, shall set forth the violation or violations that will result in\nsuch a revocation. A revocation for any of the above reasons shall be issued\nwithout a hearing based upon receipt of a certificate or certificates of\nconviction. The Commissioner may also revoke a license or permit with a problem\ndriver restriction, without a hearing, upon receipt of a certificate of\nconviction that indicates that the applicant has driven in violation of the\nconditions of such restriction. (ii)\n\nApplication for relicensure after\nrevocation of license or permit with problem driver restriction. (a) Except as provided in section\n136.5\n(b)(3)(i), if the applicant held a license or permit with a problem driver restriction and\nsuch restriction was for a period of five years, and such person's license or\npermit is revoked pursuant to this paragraph, the Commissioner shall deny the\napplication for at least five years, in addition to any revocation period\nimposed pursuant to the Vehicle and Traffic Law. After such waiting period, the\n\nCommissioner may approve the application, provided that upon such approval the\n\nCommissioner shall impose the problem driver restriction on such person's\nlicense for a period of five years and may require the installation of an\nignition interlock device in any motor vehicle owned or operated by such person\nfor a period of no less than two but no more than five years. Such period shall\nbe based, in part, on the period of time the applicant had installed an\nignition interlock device pursuant to section\n136.5\n(b)(3)(i). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, if such applicant's\nlicense or permit with a problem driver restriction was previously revoked\npursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, no new license or permit shall be\nissued, except that the Commissioner shall not be foreclosed from consideration\nof unusual, extenuating and compelling circumstances that may be presented for\nreview and which may form a valid basis to deviate from the general policy, as\nset forth above, in the exercise of discretionary authority granted under\nsection\n510\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law. If an application is approved based upon the\nexercise of such discretionary authority, the reasons for approval shall be set\nforth in writing and recorded. (b) Except as provided in section\n136.5\n(b)(4)(i), if the applicant held a license or permit with a problem driver restriction and\nsuch restriction was for a period of two years, and such person's license or\npermit is revoked pursuant to this paragraph, the Commissioner shall deny the\napplication for at least two years, in addition to any minimum revocation\nperiod imposed pursuant to the Vehicle and Traffic Law. After such waiting\nperiod, the Commissioner may approve the application, provided that upon such\napproval the Commissioner shall impose the problem driver restriction on such\nperson's license for a period of two years. Notwithstanding any other provision\nof this subdivision, if such applicant's license or permit with a problem\ndriver restriction was previously revoked pursuant to the provisions of this\nparagraph, no new license or permit shall be issued, except that the\n\nCommissioner shall not be foreclosed from consideration of unusual, extenuating\nand compelling circumstances that may be presented for review and which may\nform a valid basis to deviate from the general policy, as set forth above, in\nthe exercise of discretionary authority granted under section\n510\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law.

A person required to\noperate a motor vehicle owned by such person's employer in the course and scope\nof his or her employment may operate that vehicle without installation of an\nignition interlock device only in the course and scope of such employment and\nonly if such person carries in the motor vehicle written documentation\nindicating the employer has knowledge of the restriction imposed and has\ngranted permission for the person to operate the employer's vehicle without the\ndevice only for business purposes. Such documentation shall display the\nemployer's letterhead and have an authorized signature of the employer. A motor\nvehicle owned by a business entity that is wholly or partly owned or controlled\nby a person subject to the problem driver restriction is not a motor vehicle\nowned by the employer for purposes of the exemption provided in this paragraph\nand shall be deemed to be owned by the person subject to the problem driver\nrestriction.

(e) Repealed and reserved\n(f) While it is the Commissioner's general\npolicy to deny an application based on those elements cited in subdivisions\n(a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the commissioner shall not be foreclosed\nfrom consideration of unusual, extenuating or compelling circumstances which\nmay be presented for review, which form a valid basis to deviate from the\ngeneral policy, as set forth above, in the exercise of the discretionary\nauthority granted under section\n510\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law. If an application is approved based upon the\nexercise of such discretionary authority, the reasons for approval shall be\nstated in writing and recorded.
