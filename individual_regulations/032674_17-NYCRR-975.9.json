  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.9 - Contract service requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nPrior to making service payments to a transportation\nauthority, county, or city for services provided under contract with a\ncorporation, firm or individual to provide mass transportation services, pursuant to section\n18-b\nof the\n\nTransportation Law and section\n119-r\nof the General Municipal Law, a copy of such contract must be provided to the\n\nDepartment. If the contract involves intercity bus services, services that\nextend outside of New York State, services that extend outside of the\nboundaries of the contracting city, county or transportation authority, then\nthe following procedures and provision also apply: (a) Intercity bus services. Prior to entering\ninto, extending or continuing such a contract for intercity bus services with\nany intercity bus company such transportation authority, county, or city shall\nsubmit the proposed service contract and supporting records describing the\nservices and its finances to the Department for review and approval. The\n\nDepartment review will determine if the service is already under contract, duplicates other subsidized services, is provided in an effective manner and\nmeets other program requirements. (b) Services that operate outside N.Y. State. Any new, amended or renewed contract between a transportation authority, county, or city and a corporation, firm or individual, to provide mass\ntransportation services, pursuant to section\n18-b\nof the\n\nTransportation Law, shall reflect the following general policy of the\n\nDepartment of Transportation where such service, or a portion of such service, is to be interstate commerce. In order for a public transportation system that\nprovides mass transportation services outside of New York State to be eligible\nfor a State service payment, such system must demonstrate to the Commissioner\nthat such assistance will be used exclusively for the benefit of New York State\nriders. (1)\n\nTo the degree practicable, the\nbenefits of the receipts of State moneys pursuant to such contract for mass\ntransportation services by such corporation, firm or individual shall be\napplied either: (i) to discount, or otherwise\nreduce, or minimize the fares charged for interstate service with origin and\ndestination points within the State of New York; or\n(ii)\nto provide additional service or routes\nwithin New York State pursuant to such contract. (2)\n\nSuch general policy may be carried out in\neither of the following manners as prescribed by the Commissioner: (i) a plan therefor submitted through the\ntransportation authority, county, or city by the corporation, firm or\nindividual, to the Commissioner of Transportation for approval, and such plan\nbeing subsequently approved; or\n(ii)\nthe contract containing a clause that\nthe benefits from the operating assistance shall be reflected in the fares for\ninterstate trips having an origin and destination within the State of New York\nby discount or credit that is equal to the percentage relationship between the\ntotal subsidy payment and the full farebox revenues generated by such\ninterstate trips. (3)\n\nSuch corporation, firm or individual, when required by such contract to provide\nadditional service or routes, may deduct any deficits generated by such\noperations from the total subsidy payment in determining the required fare\ndiscount, other reduction, or minimization of fares. Should such corporation, firm or individual be receiving payment of moneys pursuant to a valid existing\ncontract with a transportation authority, city or county which does not contain\nplan submission or discount or credit provisions as outlined herein, such\ncontract shall be amended so as to incorporate such a provision as soon as is\nlegally possible. (c) Services that extend outside the boundary of the contracting Municipal\n\nCorporation. In order for counties or cities contracting for mass\ntransportation services under the provisions of section\n119-r\nof the General Municipal Law to be eligible for a State service payment for\nservice that extends beyond its boundaries then the following will apply: (1)\n\nVehicle miles both inside and outside the\n\nMunicipal Corporation can be submitted as eligible for calculating service\npayments if the service is local bus service or commuter bus service that\nextends to a destination in a nearby county if such service is of primary\nbenefit to the residents of the contracting county or city. Counties or cities\nintending to contract for commuter bus services under this provision must\nobtain Department approval to do so by no later than the seventeenth day of the\nfirst month of a quarter for which the service is to be provided. Requests for\napproval shall describe the commuter services to be contracted for outside of\nthe jurisdictional boundaries and the benefits that their residents receive\nfrom such services. In approving such services, the Department shall consider\nthe type and need for subsidy to maintain adequate service, reasonable return\non equity, operating cost guidelines, and impact on other operators. (2)\n\nCounties and cities may sponsor intercity\nbus services that serve more than one county, and that meet the requirements of\nsection\n975.9\n(a) but only\nfor the services that are within their municipality; i.e., they may only submit\nthe revenue vehicle miles and revenue passengers within the jurisdictional\nboundaries of the sponsoring county or city.
