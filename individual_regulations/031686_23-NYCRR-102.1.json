  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23 § 102.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn 2015, the Department of Financial Services (\"Department\")\nadopted 23 NYCRR Part\n200, which required persons engaged in virtual currency\nbusiness activity, as defined in 23 NYCRR\n200.2\n(q), to obtain a license, subject to certain exemptions, before engaging in such activity in New York. This licensing regime was created under the authority granted to the Department\nby the Financial Services Law (\"FSL\"). Generally, the Department's costs and expenses are charged to\nand paid by persons regulated by the Department. At the time that Part 200 was\nadopted, FSL section 206 provided that the costs and expenses of the Department\nwould be respectively charged to and paid by the persons regulated by the\n\nDepartment pursuant to the Banking Law or the Insurance Law, with no provision\nmade for the assessment of costs for persons regulated pursuant to the FSL. In\n2022, the Laws of New York, Chapter 58, Part III, amended FSL Section 206 (a), as of June 30, 2022, to require the Department to assess the costs and expenses\nof regulating persons licensed pursuant to 23 NYCRR Part\n200\n(\"Licensees\"). FSL\nsection 206 (a) now states: \"ersons regulated under that engage in 'virtual\ncurrency business activity,' as that term is defined by the department, shall\nbe assessed by the superintendent for the operating expenses of the department\nthat are solely attributable to regulating such persons....\"\nTo effectuate the authority granted by the recent amendment\nof the FSL, this regulation sets forth the basis for allocating the\n\nDepartment's costs and expenses among Licensees, and the process for making\nsuch assessments. This regulation only applies to Licensees, and the assessment\nonly covers the costs and expenses associated with the Department's oversight\nof each person's virtual currency business activities. Accordingly, to the\nextent that a person is licensed to engage in virtual currency business\nactivities under the FSL, and concurrently as a money transmitter pursuant to\n\nArticle XIII-B of the Banking Law, such person will be billed separately for\neach license. To the extent that a person holds multiple licenses to engage in\nvirtual currency business activities pursuant to 23 NYCRR Part\n200, such person\nwill be billed separately for each license. Persons who engage in virtual\ncurrency business activities as a limited purpose trust company or a banking\norganization will continue to be assessed under 23 NYCRR Part\n101. To such an\nextent that a person holds both a limited purpose trust charter under the\n\nBanking Law and a license pursuant to 23 NYCRR Part\n200, such person will be\nbilled separately for each charter and license. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23\n§\n102.1\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 19, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 16, eff. 4/19/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
