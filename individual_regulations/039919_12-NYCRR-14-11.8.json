  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-11.8 - Water gage, water level\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach miniature boiler for operation with a definite\nwater level shall be equipped with a glass water gage for determining the water\nlevel. The lowest permissible water level shall be at a point one-third of the\nheight of the shell, except where the boiler is equipped with internal furnace, when it shall be not less than one-third of the length of the tubes above the\ntop of the furnace. In the case of small steam generating units operated on the\nclosed system where there is insufficient space for the usual glass water gage, water level indicators of the glass bulls-eye type may be\nused. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-11.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
