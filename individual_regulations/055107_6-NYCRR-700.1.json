Model parameters should represent biological\nphenomena rather than arbitrary statistically-derived values such as polynomial\nregression coefficients. Such models, if they accurately describe the\nrelationship between dose and response within the range of experimental\nobservation, may provide biological justification for predicted responses at\ndoses below the range of observation.
