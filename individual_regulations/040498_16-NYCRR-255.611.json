  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.611 - Change in class location: confirmation or revision of maximum allowable operating pressure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Within 60\ndays after the required study is completed, the operator shall submit a program\nfor redesigning and/or testing the respective pipeline segments, or appropriate\nreduction of the maximum certified operating pressures thereof, to conform to\nthe respective then current class locations, in accordance with this Part, or\ndeclare that the design, testing, and operation of the respective pipeline\nsegments conform to the respective then current class locations. (b) Where the hoop stress corresponding to\nthe established maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline\nis not commensurate with the present class location, and the segment is in\nsatisfactory physical condition, the maximum allowable operating pressure of\nthat segment of pipeline must be confirmed or revised. (1)\n\nIf the segment involved has been\npreviously tested in place to at least 90 percent of its SMYS for a period of\nnot less than eight hours, the maximum allowable operating pressure must be\nconfirmed or reduced so that the corresponding hoop stress will not exceed 72\npercent of SMYS in Class 2 locations, 60 percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 locations. (2)\n\nIf the segment involved has not been\npreviously tested in place as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the maximum allowable operating pressure must be reduced so that the\ncorresponding hoop stress is not more than that allowed by this Part for new\nsegments of pipelines in the existing class location. (3)\n\nIf the segment of pipeline involved has\nnot been qualified for operation under paragraph (1) or (2) of this\nsubdivision, it must be tested in accordance with the applicable requirements\nof this Part, and its maximum allowable operating pressure must then be\nestablished so as to be equal to or less than each of the following: (i) The maximum allowable operating pressure\nafter the requalification test is 0.8 times the test pressure for Class 2\nlocations, 0.667 times the test pressure for Class 3 locations, and 0.555 times\nthe test pressure for Class 4 locations. (ii)\n\nThe maximum allowable operating pressure\nconfirmed or revised in accordance with the section, may not exceed the maximum\nallowable operating pressure established before the confirmation or\nrevision. (iii)\n\nThe corresponding\nhoop stress may not exceed 72 percent of SMYS in Class 2 locations, 60 percent\nof SMYS in Class 3 locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in class 4\nlocations. (c) Confirmation or revision of the maximum\nallowable operating pressure of segment of pipeline in accordance with this\nsection does not preclude the application of sections\n255.553\nand\n255.555\nof this Part. (d) Confirmation or revision of the maximum\nallowable operating pressure that is required as a result of a study under\nsection\n255.609\nof this Part must be\ncompleted within 18 months of the change in class location. (e) Pressure reduction under paragraph (b)(2)\nof this section within the 18- month period does not preclude establishing a\nmaximum allowable operating pressure under paragraph (b)(3) of this section at\na later date. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.611\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
