  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 481.1 - Method of computing tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 503\n(a) The tax is based on the mileage within\nthe State and the weight of the motor vehicle. Two alternative methods are\nprovided for computing the tax: the gross weight method and the unloaded weight\nmethod. (b) Under the gross weight\nmethod the tax is imposed on all vehicular units with a maximum gross weight in\nexcess of 18,000 pounds. Vehicular unit\nis defined in the\nstatute to include a motor vehicle or any combination of motor vehicles\noperated as a unit. Thus a truck and a tractor-trailer combination are\nvehicular units. The tax rate is based on the maximum gross weight of each such\nvehicular unit when operating with a load or any part of a load, and on the\nunloaded weight thereof when operating without any load whatsoever. (c) Under the unloaded weight method the tax\nis imposed on all trucks having an unloaded weight in excess of 8,000 pounds\nand on all tractors having an unloaded weight in excess of 4,000 pounds. No tax\nis imposed on trailers or other devices drawn by trucks or tractors, even\nthough permits are obtained therefor. The tax rate is based on the unloaded\nweight of the truck or tractor and the same rate is applicable whether the\ntruck is operating with or without a load, or whether the tractor is operating\nalone or in combination with any other motor vehicle. (d) Separate rate tables are provided for use\nunder the gross weight method (section\n481.3\nof this Part) and for use under the unloaded weight method (section\n481.10\nof this Part). Under the gross weight method, the same rate table is used, whether the motor vehicle is operating with or without a load. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n481.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
