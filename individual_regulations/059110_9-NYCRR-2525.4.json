Tit. 9 § 2525.4 - Security deposits\n\nState Regulations\n\nRegardless of any contract, agreement, lease or other\nobligation heretofore or hereafter entered into, no owner, in addition to the\nauthorized collection of rent, shall demand, receive or retain a security\ndeposit or advance payment for or in connection with the use or occupancy of a\nhousing accommodation which exceeds the rent for one month; provided, however, that where a greater security deposit was paid by the tenant in continuous\noccupancy since the date the housing accommodation became subject to the RSL, such deposit may continue in effect during the term of such lease and any\nrenewals thereof with the same tenant. Such security deposit shall be subject\nto the following conditions: (a) the\nsecurity deposit shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account in a banking\norganization in New York State; (b) the person depositing such security money shall be entitled to receive, as\nadministrative expenses, a sum equivalent to one percent per annum upon the\nsecurity money so deposited; (c) at\nthe tenant's option, the balance of the interest paid by the banking\norganization shall be applied for the rental of the housing accommodation, or\nheld in trust until repaid, or annually paid to the tenant; and\n(d) the owner otherwise complies with the\nprovisions of article 7 of the General Obligations Law.
