(d) Sources of funds to pay interest\npenalties. Funds to pay interest penalties for personal service contracts and\nnonpersonal contracts will be drawn from earnings on investments, fees, and\nmiscellaneous income. (e) Facts and\nconditions which may justify extension of prompt payment without penalty. The\nfollowing facts and conditions shall extend the payment schedule set forth in\nsubdivision (b) of this section without imposition of an interest penalty: (1)\n\nIf statutory or contractual provisions\nrequire or authorize an inspection, audit, approval or certification prior to\npayment, in order to determine the resources applied or used by a contractor or\notherwise to verify that the work, goods or services billed for were provided\nin accordance with the contract; (2)\nif the necessary State government\nappropriation required to authorize payment has yet to be enacted; (3)\nif another governmental agency must\nexamine a proper invoice prior to payment; and\n(4)\nthe provisions of subdivision (f) of this\nsection which address irregularities of contract compliance, invoice\npreparation and others. Any time taken to satisfy or rectify any of the facts or\nconditions described in subdivision (e) of this section shall extend by an\nequal period of time the date by which contract payments must be made in order\nfor UDC not to become liable for interest payments. (f) Notifications to contractors.

If UDC fails to notify a contractor of such defects, suspected improprieties or objections within 15 calendar days of receipt of\ninvoice, the number of days allowed for payment of the corrected proper invoice\nwill be reduced by the number of days between the 15th day and the day that\nnotification was transmitted to the contractor.
