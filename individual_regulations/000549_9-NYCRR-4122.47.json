  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4122.47 - Pick-six jackpot pools\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nwinning pick-six jackpot wager requires selection of the first-place finisher\nin each of six designated, consecutive contests, unless otherwise provided in\nthis section. The association or corporation must obtain written approval from\nthe commission concerning the scheduling of pick-six jackpot contests, the\ndesignation of the method used, the bet minimum, the takeout rate, the\ndefinition that will be relied upon for determining the existence of a unique\nwinning ticket, the major-minor pool split and the amount of any cap to be set\non the carryover. Any changes to the approved pick-six jackpot format require\nprior approval from the commission. (b) The pick-six jackpot wager is not a\nparlay and has no connection or relation to the other betting pools for the\nrespective races. The pick-six jackpot pool shall be held entirely separate\nfrom all other pools and is no part of a daily double, exacta, quinella, trifecta, superfecta, pick-six or other wagering pool. (c) Resale of pick-six jackpot tickets from\none individual to another is prohibited, shall be grounds for ejection, and may\nbe deemed illegal gambling. (d) Races in which pick-six jackpot pools shall be conducted shall be clearly\ndesignated in the program and racing cards issued by the association or\ncorporation. (e) The design of the\npick-six jackpot tickets shall be clearly and immediately distinguishable from\nother pari-mutuel tickets. (f) Scratched horses and nonstarters. Should a programmed starter be scratched or\ndeclared a nonstarter in any pick-six jackpot race before the start of the\nfirst pick-six jackpot race, affected bettors may select another betting\ninterest, if a wager can be canceled and a replacement wager issued before the\nstart of the first pick-six jackpot race, or may obtain a cancellation of the\nwager issued before the start of the first race of the pick-six jackpot\nsequence. If neither option is exercised, then wagers upon such scratched or\ndeclared nonstarter shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse for such\nrace. The designated horse means the betting entry or field upon which the most\nwagering money has been registered at the track in the win pool at the close of\nwin-pool betting for such race. (In the event of a money tie, the tied betting\nentry or field with the lowest program number shall be designated.) At any time\nafter wagering begins on the pick-six jackpot pool, should an entire betting\nentry or field be scratched or declared a nonstarter in any pick-six jackpot\nrace, no further tickets selecting such betting entry or field shall be issued, and wagers upon such betting entry or field, for purposes of the pick-six\njackpot pool, shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse. Wagers in the\npick-six jackpot pool upon an entry or field of horses from which a starter or\nstarters may have been scratched will, in the case of such entry or field, be\ndeemed wagers upon the horse or horses remaining in such entry or field, except\nat tracks with totalisator capability to record wagers selecting a coupled\nentry (or field) and wagers selecting any individual constituent horses therein\n(merging such wagers for odds display and payoff purposes), in which case, the\nwagers upon scratched constituent horses will be deemed wagers upon the\ndesignated horse in such race. In case no starter remains representing any\nbetting entry or field, wagers upon such entry or field shall be deemed wagers\nupon the designated horse in the race affected by the scratch. Should the\nbalance of a betting entry or field race as a non-betting starter for purposes\nof other pari-mutuel pools, as provided in section\n4122.25\nof this Article, wagers\nupon such entry or field shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse for\nsuch race. Should a programmed starter be scratched or declared a nonstarter\nprior to the start of the first leg, the betting operator shall be authorized\nto refund any tickets designating betting entries affected thereby prior to\nsuch first leg. (g) Wagering\ntickets and winners. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (h) of this\nsection: (1)\n\nThe pick-six jackpot pool shall\nbe apportioned as follows: The net pick-six jackpot pool and carryover, if any, shall be distributed to the holder of a unique winning ticket that selected the\nfirst-place finisher in each of the six designated races. (2)\n\nIf there is no unique ticket selecting\nthe first-place finisher in all six designated races, the major share of the\nnet pick-six jackpot pool shall be distributed as a single price pool to those\nwho selected the first-place finisher in the greatest number of pick-six\njackpot races, and the minor share shall be added to the carryover. (3)\n\nShould there be no wager selecting the\nwinner of at least one of the pick-six jackpot races, the day's net pool shall\nbe refunded and the previous carryover pool amount, if any, shall be carried\nover to the next scheduled corresponding pool. (4)\n\nIn obtaining authorization for operating\nthe pick-six jackpot, the association or corporation must clearly identify\nwhich of the following two definitions shall apply for determining the\nexistence of a unique winning ticket: (i) There is one and only one winning ticket that correctly selected the\nfirst-place finisher in each of the pick-six jackpot races, to be verified by\nthe unique serial number assigned by the totalisator company that issues the\nwinning ticket; or\n(ii)\n\nThe total\namount wagered on one and only one winning combination selecting the\nfirst-place finisher in each of the pick-six jackpot races, is equal to the\nminimum allowable wager. (h) Race cancellations. This subdivision\napplies except for pick-six jackpot pools in which an intermediate or final\ndistribution is to be made. The net pool shall be distributed as a single price\npool to those whose selection finished first in the greatest number of pick-six\njackpot races, if one or two pick-six jackpot races are cancelled or declared\nno race, non-betting or no contest after the first pick-six jackpot race has\nbeen made official. The pick-six jackpot pool shall be declared off and the\ngross pool refunded: (1)\nif any designated\nrace is canceled or declared no race or non-betting before the first pick-six\njackpot race is made official; or\n(2)\nif three or more pick-six jackpot races\nare cancelled or declared no race, non-betting or no contest. (i) [Reserved]\n(j) Dead heats. Each horse in a dead heat for\nwin shall be considered the winner, and no allocations among wagers shall be\nmade as a result thereof, unlike the practice in a pari-mutuel win pool. The\npayoff price per dollar shall be the same for each class of winning\nwager. (k) Carryovers. Carryovers\nfrom prior pick-six jackpot pools, advertised guaranteed amounts or advertised\nadded amounts will be distributed to winners in such day's pick-six jackpot\npools, provided that there are no cancelled or no-contest races in the pick-six\njackpot sequence and no intermediate or final distribution is to be\nmade. (l) Intermediate\ndistributions. Prior to the last two weeks of a race meeting at a track, a date\nand program approved by the commission may be announced by the track operator\nat which (provided no one thereafter has the only wager that correctly selects\nthe winners of all six designated races) accumulated carryovers will be added\nto the net pool distributable to wagers selecting the winners of the most races\nof the pick six jackpot pool conducted on such program. Distributing the\npick-six jackpot carryover requires a written request for permission submitted\nfor Commission approval. The request must contain justification for the\ndistribution, an explanation of the benefit to be derived and intended date of\nthe distribution. If all pick-six jackpot races on the program designated for\nintermediate distribution are canceled, or the pick-six jackpot pool is\nrefunded, a pick-six jackpot pool shall be conducted on the next available race\ndate with entries not yet carded. If no further programs are conducted at the\nrace meeting, a pick-six jackpot pool shall be conducted on the first program\nof the next meeting conducted at such track by such track operator to provide\nfor final distribution for such prior meeting. An intermediate distribution\nalso may be directed at any time at the commission's discretion, upon three\ndays' notice by the commission, so long as entries have not yet been\ncarded. (m) Final distribution. The\ntrack shall select, with the approval of the commission, a date and program\nduring the final week of the annual assigned racing dates of the track\noperator, when there shall be a final distribution of all accumulated\ncarryovers. The unique-wager provision of this section (set forth in paragraph\n(1) of subdivision (g) of this section) shall be suspended, and the entire pool\nshall be distributed as a single-price pool to those whose selection finished\nfirst in the greatest number of pick-six jackpot races. Thereafter, no pick-six\njackpot pools are permitted to be conducted during such week. In the event that\nall pick-six jackpot races on the program designated for final distribution are\ncancelled, or the pick-six jackpot pool is refunded, and no further programs\nare conducted at the meeting, the commission shall require that a pick-six\njackpot pool be conducted on the first program of the next race meeting\nconducted at such track by such track operator to provide for final\ndistribution for such prior meeting. The commission also may order a final\ndistribution for an earlier time in the commission's discretion. (n) The association or corporation may\nsuspend previously approved pick-six jackpot wagering with the prior approval\nof the commission. Any carryover shall be held until the suspended pick-six\njackpot wagering is reinstated. An association or corporation may request\napproval of a pick-six jackpot wager or separate wagering pool for specific\nperformances. (o) [Reserved]. (p) In the event of\noccurrences not encompassed within the explicit provisions of this section, distribution shall be formulated on the basis of established pari-mutuel\npractice and in accordance with the distribution philosophy set forth in this\nsection; provided, nevertheless, that if full distribution of the pool is made\non the basis of outstanding tickets, then the method of formulation announced\nby the track and the basis upon which payments have been made shall be deemed\nconclusively correct and not subject to review. (q) Posting of winning combinations. Every\npick-six jackpot wagering combination entitled to a payoff shall be posted\npublicly by the track operator together with the payoff price. (r) Non-transferability. Pick-six jackpot\ntickets shall be nontransferable, and violations of this subdivision may lead\nto confiscation and cancellation of such tickets in addition to other\ndisciplinary action. (s) Betting\ninformation. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission, information concerning\ncombinations wagered upon or not wagered upon in a pick-six jackpot pool shall\nnot be disclosed by the totalisator operator, or otherwise, until the final\npick-six jackpot race remains as the only race to be contested for completion\nof the pick-six jackpot wager. The operation of the totalisator equipment and\nreports generated thereby, as well as the communication of any information\nconcerning such pool, shall be subject to the strict supervision of the\ncommission. (t) No reduction in\nguaranteed distributions. Advertised added monies or minimum distributions\nshall not apply to intermediate or final distributions, unless a wager\ncorrectly selects winners of all six designated races, or five winners and no\nmore than one all-win of the pick-six pool. A guaranteed minimum distribution\nor guaranteed added money amount, once advertised, may not be reduced and shall\ncontinue to be guaranteed by the track operator for every pick-six pool for the\nbalance of the meeting. (u) Interfacing of off-track wagers. Interfacing of off-track wagers shall be\naccomplished according to procedures approved by the commission. In the event\nthere is a failure to interface all such wagers with on-track wagers in\naccordance with such procedures, the procedure for distribution of the pool and\ncomputation of payoff prices shall be approved by the commission. (v) Trust funds. Carry-over monies shall be\nheld in a separate account in trust by track operators for the benefit of\nparticipants in pick-six pools until distributed. (w) Seed money or insurance allocation. A\npercentage designated by the track operator and approved by the commission, not\nexceeding two percent of the total daily pick-six jackpot pool wagering, shall\nbe held apart by the track operator from the takeout of each pick-six jackpot\npool to reimburse such track operator for the cost of any insurance it may\nsecure to guarantee minimum distributions to winners of such pools, or to\nreimburse a track operator for funds such track operator expends for added\nmoney or guaranteed minimum distributions to winners of such pools. Any\naccumulation of such allocations not necessary to reimburse a track for\nexpenditures actually incurred for such purposes shall be added to the amounts\ndistributable in the pool designated for final distribution for the\nmeeting. (x) Copies of this section\nshall be made available free of charge by the track to the public in the public\nbetting area of the track. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
