  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.8 - Preparation for trial by summary courts-martial\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Upon receipt of the charges and\naccompanying papers referred by the convening authority, the summary\ncourts-martial (SCM) should consider, among other aspects of the case, the\nfollowing: (1)\n\nThe file received will normally\ninclude several copies of the charge sheet; written statements of witnesses or\nsummaries thereof; any documentary evidence, such as DA form 1379 as utilized\nby the Army National Guard and NGB form 633 as utilized by the Air National\n\nGuard indicating a change in personnel status for cases involving absence\nwithout leave; and copies of the record of previous convictions, if\nany. (2)\n\nThe SCM may use statements\nof witnesses contained in the file only for the purpose of preparing for trial; that is, to determine the order of witnesses and the questions the SCM will ask\nand for certain other limited purposes such as impeachment of the testimony of\na witness at trial by previously inconsistent statements. (3)\n\nThe SCM may not use a military police\nreport as a substitute for live witnesses except to the extent the accused\nconsents after being advised that he or she need not do so, and that he or she\nis entitled to have the witnesses present. (4)\n\nIn preparing for trial, the SCM may\nlocate and obtain for use at the trial any relevant documentary or real\nevidence, even if it was not contained or mentioned in the file as\nreceived. (5)\n\nThe SCM may consider\nas evidence in the case only the testimony and other evidence admissible under\nthe rules of evidence (Part 517 of this Title) which is actually received as\nevidence at the trial in the presence of the accused. (6)\nA record of previous convictions will\nrarely be admissible on the question of guilt or innocence. Therefore, you may\nconsider previous convictions only for the purposes of determining what\nsentence is appropriate in the event you have found the accused\nguilty. (7)\n\nRemember, that any\noffense to which the accused pleads not guilty, the accused must be presumed to\nbe innocent until guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is established by legal and\ncompetent evidence received at the trial in the accused's presence. (b) Examination of the charge\nsheet. (1)\n\nDetermine whether the pay of the\naccused entered on page 1 of the charge sheet is consistent with the accused's\ngrade and length of service. If the pay of the accused as reflected on the\ncharge sheet appears to be inaccurate, determine the facts and make appropriate\ncorrections on all copies of the charge sheet. The SCM should initial any\nchanges. (2)\n\nCorrect any obvious\nadministrative, clerical or typographical errors on the charge sheet and\ninitial each. Corrections of the charges and specifications which involve the\ninclusion of any person, offense, or matter not fairly included in the charges\nas referred for trial will not be made. If the charges or specifications are\nfaulty in some material respect, return the file to the convening authority, explaining the reason for returning it. (3)\n\nAscertain whether the endorsement by\nwhich the case has been referred for trial is administratively correct, including the designation of the court-martial order by which the SCM was\ndetailed. If it is determined that the referral for trial is incorrect, return\nthe file to the convening authority with an explanation. (4)\n\nAscertain whether the charges are sworn. If they are not, confer with the accuser to determine whether he desires to\nswear to the truth of the charges. An accused may not be tried on unsworn\ncharges over his objection. (c) Determining the law applicable to the\ncase. (1)\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the\nelements of the offenses charged; i.e., the specific acts or omissions and the\naccompanying mental state, if applicable, which constitutes the prescribed\nconduct. Assistance in this regard can be obtained by reading the description\nof the offense or offenses in Part 518 of this Title. Also, check to see if\neach offense charged refers to the proper section of the Military\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nBe sure that each\nspecification presented in support of each offense charged actually alleges an\noffense in that if the allegations of the specification were proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt at trial, they would satisfy the elements of that offense. If\nit is concluded that the wording of the specification departs so materially\nfrom an applicable form specification that either no offense is alleged or the\nspecification is ambiguous, return the file to the convening authority stating\nthe reasons for returning it. (3)\n\nIf the accused is charged with a failure to obey a regulation or written order\nand a copy of the directive is not included in the file, obtain copies of the\ndirective and be familiar with its provisions. (d) Preparation for initial session and\nprocurement of witnesses. (1)\n\nArrange for a\nlocation at which the initial session may be held. This location must\naccommodate the hearing of witness testimony. Set a time, date and uniform for\nthe initial session. (2)\n\nNotify the\naccused, through his commanding officer, to be at the prescribed location in\nappropriate uniform at the time set for the initial session. (3)\n\nNotify all witnesses who you intend to\ncall to be ready to appear at the place of trial upon further notification by\nyou. For planning purposes, you should notify the witnesses of a tentative time\nand date at which they may be required to appear. However, if the accused\nshould plead guilty to the charges, you may have no need to call the witnesses. Furthermore, if the accused requests additional witnesses to testify in his\nbehalf or if he is granted a continuance to obtain additional evidence, the\ndate on which the witnesses will be called to testify in his behalf or if he is\ngranted a continuance to obtain additional evidence, the date on which the\nwitnesses will be called to testify may have to be postponed. By alerting the\nwitnesses to be ready to appear, if needed, but by not requiring their\nappearance until you notify them, you permit them to continue to perform their\nregular duties without interruption and without requiring them to appear\nneedlessly. (e) Procedure for the summary court. (1)\n\nThe SCM\nshould determine the order in which the witnesses are to be called. Witnesses\nfor the State should be called first, normally in an order which will permit\nthe facts of the case to be presented, as nearly as possible, in a\nchronological manner. (2)\n\nThe SCM\nshould not take the testimony of any witness by telephone at the trial without\nthe accused's consent. However, if in preparing the case or during the trial, the SCM feels a need to make further inquiry he may communicate by telephone or\notherwise with prospective witnesses or others, except the accused, for the\npurpose of determining the extent of their knowledge concerning the case. The\nSCM must not consider such an out-of-court statement as evidence in the case\nunless it becomes the subject of a stipulation of fact or testimony to which\nthe accused specifically and knowledgeably consents. (3)\n\nDetermine the admissibility and\nauthentication of any documentary evidence. Assign exhibit numbers to all\ndocumentary evidence and any real evidence (physical objects) in the order in\nwhich the SCM intends to use them at trial. When the SCM actually receives\n(admits) an exhibit in evidence at the trial, mark it \"Received in Evidence,\"\nfollowed by your initials. (4)\n\nAgain, utilize the Guide for Summary Courts-Martial (Appendix L-2) and DA Pam\n27-7. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
