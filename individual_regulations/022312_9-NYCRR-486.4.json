  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 486.4 - Nyspin security\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nterminal must be attended or secured 24 hours of each day. (b) The terminal must be housed in a duly\nauthorized structure such as one owned, operated or leased by a Federal, State, county, city, town or other recognized governmental organization. (c) Thorough background screening of\npersonnel by the employing agency is required. National and State record checks\nthrough submission of applicant fingerprint cards must be conducted for\nterminal operators, programmers, and other persons employed or utilized to\neffectuate access to, or initiate transmission of all information on NYSPIN. This shall be completed as authorized by section 837(c) of the New York State\n\nExecutive Law, section\n50 (4)\nof the Civil Service Law, and other applicable New\n\nYork State laws. This rule does not apply to terminal operators accessing SEMO\nand NWS related information only. Good management practices dictate that record\nchecks should be completed prior to employment. Appropriate background\ninvestigations must be conducted on all NYSPIN terminal operators, including\nsubmission of a complete applicant fingerprint card to the Division of Criminal\n\nJustice Services (DCJS) and to the FBI Identification Division through DCJS. Before an operator is given access through basic certification, the following\nconditions must be met: (1)\n\nThe employing\nagency staff must check the State fugitive file and national arrest and\nfugitive files. If a record of any kind is found, access will not be granted\npending review of the arrest and fugitive records. (2)\n\nWhen identification of the applicant has\nbeen established by fingerprint comparison and he/she appears to be a fugitive\nor have an arrest history for a felony or serious misdemeanor, an agency head\nor designee will review the matter. If the applicant is found to be a fugitive\nfrom justice, or to have been convicted of a felony or serious misdemeanor and\nthe agency head still considers the candidate worthy of consideration for\nemployment, the matter will be referred, with the agency head's written\nrecommendation, to the Superintendent of State Police for a final\ndetermination. (3)\n\nIf a\ndetermination is made that NYSPIN access (other than SEMO and NWS) by the\napplicant would not be in the public interest, such access will be denied and\nthe applicant's appointing authority will be notified in writing of the access\ndenial. (4)\n\nEach criminal justice\nagency authorized to access NYSPIN must have appropriate written standards for\ndiscipline of NYSPIN policy violations. (d) The computer site and/or terminal area\nmust have adequate physical security to protect against any unauthorized\npersonnel gaining access to the computer equipment or to any of the stored\ndata. The terminal device must be out of the view of unauthorized persons when\nnot in use and visitors to computer centers and/or terminal areas must be\naccompanied by staff personnel at all times. (e) Dissemination of criminal justice\ninformation (other than CHRI) by phone to non-NYSPIN participants or\nout-of-state criminal justice agencies is authorized, but only after the\nrequesting agency's ORI is confirmed (OTST) and the identity of the caller is\nvalidated. Dissemination of CHRI to out-of-state agencies by phone is\nprohibited under the terms of the use and dissemination agreement between the\nNYSPIN participants authorized to access CHRI and DCJS pursuant to section\n837 (6)\nof the Executive\n\nLaw. (f) The New York State Vehicle\nand Traffic Law, section 504, provides that the record of conviction stub of\nthe driver's license shall not be subject to inspection by any motor vehicle\ninspection officer, peace officer, police officer or any other person. Therefore, in compliance with the intent of the law and except as described\nbelow, transmission of Vehicle and Traffic Law conviction information obtained\nvia NYSPIN by two-way radio is prohibited. Previous vehicle and traffic\nconviction data may be transmitted via two-way radio whenever the degree of\noffense for an arrest in progress is affected by a previous conviction. For\nexample, when a person is under arrest for driving while intoxicated or driving\nwhile ability is impaired by the use of drugs, to advise the officer that the\nperson under arrest may have committed a felony pursuant to the Vehicle and\n\nTraffic Law, section\n1192, subdivision 5. (g) All printed matter from the NYSPIN\nterminal that must be disposed of should be destroyed by shredding, burning\n(consistent with local ordinances), or in another manner that renders the\nmaterial unreadable. (h) Each\nNYSPIN participant must designate and file with the Division of State Police a\nNYSPIN security officer who is responsible for insuring compliance with this\n\nPart (rule) and the rules contained within the NYSPIN Operating Manual. Any\nchange of such NYSPIN security officer must be reported immediately to SP\nAlbany by terminal message. (i) Every NYSPIN participant must consent to an annual audit or special audit as\napproved by the NYSPIN Advisory Committee. (j) The Superintendent of State Police shall\nestablish administrative procedures relating to system security by conducting\naudits and security and confidentiality investigations which could result in\nsuspension or termination of NYSPIN service, if warranted.
