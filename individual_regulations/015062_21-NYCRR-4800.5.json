Tit. 21 § 4800.5 - Requests for public access to records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A written request may be required, but\noral requests may be accepted when records are readily available. (b) A response shall be given regarding any\nrequest, reasonably describing the record or records sought, within five\nbusiness days of receipt of the request. (c) A request shall reasonably describe the\nrecord or records sought. Whenever possible, a person requesting records should\nsupply information regarding dates, file designations or other information that\nmay help to describe the records sought. (d) If the records access officer does not\nprovide or deny access to the record sought within five business days of\nreceipt of a request, he or she shall furnish a written acknowledgment of\nreceipt of the request and a statement of the approximate date when the request\nwill be granted or denied. If access to records is neither granted nor denied\nwithin 10 business days after the date of acknowledgment of receipt of the\nrequest, the request may be construed as a denial of access that may be\nappealed.
