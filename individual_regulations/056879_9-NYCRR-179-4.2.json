Violations of level II and level III rules may result in\ndisciplinary action. In some instances, the same type of behavior may be\nclassified in more than one of the three rule categories, depending upon the\nspecific circumstances. (a) Level I\nrules. Level I rules define basic standards of conduct for all residents in all\nareas of program. Violation of level I rules is considered an infraction and\nshall be addressed on the resident's unit. Violation of level I rules will not\nsubject a resident to formal disciplinary action. (b) Level II rules. Level II rules are\ndefined as serious misbehavior. (c) Level III rules. Level III rules are defined as very serious\nmisbehavior. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n179-4.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
