  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1631-2.2 - Safety program\n\nState Regulations\n\nRegardless of the size of the authority or development, a safety program should be formulated, initiated and followed-up. Such a safety\nprogram should include periodic inspections, employee training programs, adequate accident reporting systems, followed-up by analysis, evaluation and\ncorrective action, and cooperation with insurance carrier. (a) Periodic inspections. (1)\n\nPeriodic inspections are extremely\neffective in revealing situations and conditions which contribute to accidents. The authority should delegate to one or more employees, the responsibility for\ninspecting a prescribed area and reporting the presence of any condition\nconsidered abnormal or having accident potential. (2)\n\nIn addition to periodic inspections, every administrative and supervisory employee shall be responsible for\nreporting any potentially dangerous situation encountered in the normal course\nof their activities. (3)\nA safety\ncheck list has been included as Exhibit A [see Appendix S-5]. This list is\noffered as a guide only and in no way is to be considered\nall-inclusive. (b) Employee training program. Training programs serve to make employees accident\nconscious. Such programs may take the form of: (1)\n\nStaff meetings. (2)\n\nOn-the-job instruction in safe work\nhabits and techniques. (3)\n\nDemonstrations to groups of employees on proper techniques and procedures. Such\ndemonstrations may include the showing of slides and motion pictures where\npossible. (4)\n\nDistribution of\nleaflets and pamphlets on safety and related subjects. Note: Slides, motion pictures and printed material may\nbe obtained on loan and without cost from insurance companies and large\nindustrial firms\n(c) Accident reporting systems\n(1)\n\nAccident reporting permits the\naccumulation of statistical data which provides comparisons, makes possible the\ndetection of trends and highlights hazardous situations. Standard accident\nforms [see Appendix S-5, Exhibit B] are to be used for reporting\naccidents\n(2)\n\nAll accidents should\nbe reported as soon as possible to the division as well as to the proper\ninsurance company. Unless otherwise prescribed by the insurance company, the\ndivision's standard accident form is to be used for this purpose\n(3)\n\nIn the event of a serious accident, the\ndivision's Bureau of Management should be immediately informed by telephone. This call should be followed-up, with as little delay as is possible, by a\nwritten report on the standard form\n(d) Cooperation with insurance carrier. Insurance carriers are also interested in preventing accidents. They will\nusually provide the following services, at little or no charge, and upon\nrequest: (1)\n\nFurnish literature, pamphlets\nand posters\n(2)\n\nAssist in the\norganization of a training program\n(3)\n\nAttend employee training sessions and\npresent demonstrations, slides and motion pictures\n(4)\n\nInspect physical plant and present\nrecommendations\n(5)\n\nWork closely\nwith policy holders to reduce premiums.
