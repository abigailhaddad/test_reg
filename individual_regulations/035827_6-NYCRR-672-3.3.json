Tit. 6 §§ 672-3.3 - Operation of reservoirs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Bog Brook, East Branch, Boyds Corner, Croton Falls, Cross River and\n\nTiticus reservoirs. (1)\n\nThe agency\nshall make such water releases from the reservoirs listed in this section as\nare necessary and sufficient to maintain the required constant minimum flows in\nthe respective rivers or streams during all times of year as indicated in Table\nA of this section except when New Croton reservoir spills, the required\nconstant minimum flow shall be no less than 5,000,000 gallons per day. Such\nconstant minimum flows shall be maintained and measured for the purposes of\ncompliance with this Part at the specified measuring locations in the release\nworks of each reservoir. (2)\n\nWhen\nthe reservoirs listed in this section are physically incapable of providing\nsufficient water to maintain such constant minimum flows, the agency shall make\nthe maximum releases which the reservoirs are physically capable of providing.

Cross River\n5 mgd (7.7 cfs)\n\nCross River\n\nFlow through gate in reservoir release\nworks. Titicus\n5 mgd (7.7 cfs)\n\nTiticus River\n\nFlow through gate in reservoir release\nworks. * Total constant minimum flow of 30 mgd released from\n\nBog Brook and East Branch reservoirs shall be released to the East Branch\n\nCroton River through Diverting reservoir. (b) Middle Branch and Muscoot\nreservoirs. The Middle Branch reservoir is immediately upstream of\nand discharges directly into the Croton Falls reservoir, and there is no river\nor stream connecting the two reservoirs. Similarly, the Muscoot reservoir is\nimmediately upstream of and discharges directly into the New Croton reservoir, and there is no river or stream connecting them. Therefore, releases from the\n\nMiddle Branch and Muscoot reservoirs are not required to fulfill the purposes\nof this Subpart. While said reservoirs are not subject to any release\nrequirements, they are subject to all other applicable provisions of this\n\nPart. (c) West Branch\nreservoir. (1)\n\nWith respect to the West\n\nBranch reservoir, the agency shall make such water releases from said reservoir\nas are necessary and sufficient to maintain the following required constant\nminimum flows in the West Branch Croton River during the conditions indicated\nin the table on the following page. Such constant minimum flows shall be\nmaintained and measured for the purposes of compliance with this Part at the\ngate in the reservoir release works.

(3)\n\nWhen the\n\nWest Branch reservoir is physically incapable of providing the required minimum\nflow of five mgd, the agency shall make the maximum releases which the\nreservoir is physically capabel of providing. (d) Amawalk reservoir. (1)\n\nWith respect to the Amawalk reservoir, the agency shall make such water releases from said reservoir as are necessary\nand sufficient to maintain the following required constant minimum flows in the\n\nMuscoot River during the conditions indicated in the table in this paragraph; except when the New Croton reservoir spills, or when the water elevation in the\n\nAmawalk reservoir is below 379.60 feet mean sea level, the required constant\nminimum releases shall be five mgd. Such constant minimum flows shall be\nmaintained and measured for the purposes of compliance with this Part at the\ngate in the reservoir release works.

(e) New\n\nCroton reservoir. With respect to the New Croton reservoir, the agency\nshall make such water releases from said reservoir as are necessary and\nsufficient to maintain the following required constant minimum flows in the\n\nCroton River during the conditions and dates indicated in the table in this\nsubdivision. Such constant minimum flows shall be maintained and measured for\nthe purposes of compliance with this Part at the New Croton gaging\nstation.

(f) Modifications\nof stream flow condition and reservoir storage condition curves. To the degree herein specified, this subdivision shall\nsupersede the provisions of section 672-1.10 of this Part. The stream flow\nconditions and reservoir storage conditions set forth in subdivisions (c)-(e)\nof this section are defined respectively in Appendix 11 and Appendix 12 of this\n\nTitle. Technical modifications of curves A and B set forth in Appendices 11 and\n12 may be necessary, based on additional studies or data. The department\nreservoir releases manager may make minor technical modifications of such\ncurves without public hearing, after consultation with the agency reservoir\nreleases manager. Provided, no such modification that alters any point on any\nsuch curves by more than 10 percent, either individually or in combination with\nother modifications under this subdivision made without public hearings, shall\nbe made except in compliance with section 672-1.10 of this Part. (g) The agency is not required to\nprovide any notice to the department prior to the commencement of any action\nthat is consistent with the provisions of subdivisions (a) (c), (d) and (e) of\nthis section. (h) The agency shall\ncomply with a request by the department pursuant to subdivision (g) of section\n672-1.3\nof this Part. Footnotes\n* Total constant minimum flow of 30 mgd released from\n\nBog Brook and East Branch reservoirs shall be released to the East Branch\n\nCroton River through Diverting reservoir. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n672-3.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
