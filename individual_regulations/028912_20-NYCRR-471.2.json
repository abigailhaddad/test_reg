  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 471.2 - Exclusions\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 501, subd. 2; § 503-a, subd. 1, 9\n(a) Article 21 of the Tax Law specifically\nexcludes certain vehicles from the definition of motor vehicle. Such a vehicle, irrespective of its unloaded or maximum gross weight, is not required to have a\npermit. The following vehicles if used exclusively for the purposes for which\nthey were designed are excluded: (1)\nA\nvehicle operating on fixed rails or tracks. (2)\nA road roller. (3)\nA tractor-crane. (4)\nA truck-crane. (5)\nA power-shovel. (6)\nA road building machine. (7)\nA snow plow. (8)\nA road sweeper. (9)\nA sand spreader. (10)\nA well driller and\n(11)\n\nAn omnibus except as provided in\nsubdivisions (c) and (d) of this section. (b) The vehicles listed above are excluded\nfrom the definition of motor vehicle only when they are used for the purposes\nfor which they were designed. When used for any other purposes they are deemed\nto be motor vehicles. Accordingly, a permit and plate must be obtained for any\nvehicle listed above if it is used at any time for any purpose other than that\nfor which it was designed irrespective of the length of time it is so used and\nif (1) its maximum gross weight is in excess of 18,000 pounds or (2) its\nunloaded weight is over 4,000 pounds (if a tractor) or over 8,000 pounds (if a\ntruck) and the carrier has elected the unloaded weight method of computing the\ntax. In such instance its mileage during the period when used for such purpose\nis subject to tax. Example 1: A snow plow, which is used for no other purpose, is not a\nmotor vehicle regardless of its maximum gross weight or unloaded weight, and is\ntherefore not required to have a permit. Example 2: A road building machine, with an unloaded weight of\n25,000 pounds, is used for road building operations and is also used in\ntransport materials to customers. It is excluded from the definition of motor\nvehicle only when used for road building operations. When it is used for any\nother purpose it is a motor vehicle. Therefore, a permit and plate should be\nobtained for such motor vehicle. The mileage of the vehicle when it is used as\na road building machine is not subject to tax but its mileage when being used\nfor any other purpose is taxable. (c) Any omnibus engaged in the interstate or\nforeign transportation of passengers and subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nInterstate Commerce Commission, or any agency successor thereto, or one or more\n\nState regulatory agencies concerned with the regulation of passenger transport\nhaving a seating capacity of more than seven persons in addition to the driver, is considered a motor vehicle for purposes of the additional tax on highway\nuse, the fuel use tax, imposed by section\n503-a\nof the Tax Law and provided for in\n\nArticle 3 of this Subchapter. (d) An omnibus, irrespective of its unloaded or maximum gross weight, is not\nrequired to have a highway use permit and plate for purposes of the truck\nmileage tax. However, an omnibus engaged in the interstate or foreign\ntransportation of passengers and subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate\n\nCommerce Commission, or any agency successor thereto, or one or more State\nregulatory agencies concerned with the regulation of passenger transport, having a seating capacity of more than seven persons in addition to the driver, is required to have a permit (form MT-976) and identification sticker (form\nMT-980) for purposes of the fuel use tax.
