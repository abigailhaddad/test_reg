  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 235-11.1 - Alternative control plan for consumer products\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe purpose of this Subpart is to provide an alternative\nmethod to comply with the Table of Standards specified in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. This alternative is provided by allowing responsible ACP parties the\noption of voluntarily entering into separate alternative control plans for\nconsumer products, as specified in Subparts 235-1 through 235-11 of this Part. Only responsible ACP parties for consumer products may enter into an ACP. When\napproved by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation, the Alternative Control Plan (ACP) will be\nsubmitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a State\n\nImplementation Plan revision for approval. (a) Any manufacturer of consumer products\nwhich have been granted an ACP agreement by the CARB under the provisions in\nsections 94540-94555 of\n\nTitle 17\nof the California Code of Regulations (see\n\nTable 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) shall be\nexempt from the Table of Standards in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart for the period of time that the CARB ACP agreement remains in effect\nprovided that all ACP products within the CARB ACP agreement are contained in\nthe Table of Standards in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. Any manufacturer claiming such an ACP agreement on this basis must submit\nto the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation a copy of the CARB ACP decision ('i.e.', the Executive Order), including all conditions established by CARB applicable to the\nexemption. (b) Manufacturers of\nconsumer products that have been granted an ACP agreement under the ACP\nprovision in sections 94540-94555 of\n\nTitle 17\nof the California Code of\n\nRegulations (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) based on\n\nCalifornia specific data, or that have not been granted an exemption by the\nCARB may seek an ACP agreement in accordance with subdivisions (c) through (m)\nof this section. (c) 'Requirements\nand process for approval of an ACP'. (1)\n\nTo be\nconsidered by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation for approval, an application for a proposed ACP\nshall be submitted in writing to the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation by the responsible ACP party and shall\ncontain all of the following: (i) an\nidentification of the contact persons, phone numbers, names and addresses of\nthe responsible ACP party which is submitting the ACP application and will be\nimplementing the ACP requirements specified in the ACP agreement; (ii)\na statement of whether the responsible\nACP party is a small business or a one-product business, as defined in section\n235-2.1\n(fg)\nand\n235-2.1\n(dx)\nof\nthis Part; (iii)\na listing of the\nexact product brand name, form, available variations (flavors, scents, colors, sizes, etc.), and applicable product category(ies) for each distinct ACP\nproduct that is proposed for inclusion in the ACP; (iv)\nfor each proposed ACP product identified\nin subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, a demonstration to the satisfaction of\nthe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation that the enforceable sales records to be used by the responsible\nACP party for tracking product sales meet the minimum criteria specified in\nclause ('e') of this subparagraph. To provide this demonstration, the\nresponsible ACP party shall do all of the following: ('a')\nprovide the contact persons, phone\nnumbers, names, street and mail addresses of all persons and businesses who\nwill provide information that will be used to determine the enforceable sales; and\n('b')\ndetermine the enforceable\nsales of each product using enforceable sales records as defined in section\n235-2.1\n(bk)\nof\nthis Part; and\n('c')\ndemonstrate, to\nthe satisfaction of the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation, the validity of the enforceable sales based on\nenforceable sales records provided by the contact persons or the responsible\nACP party; and\n('d')\ncalculate the\npercentage of the gross New York State sales, as defined in section\n235-2.1\n(ck)\nof\nthis Part which is comprised of enforceable sales; and\n('e')\ndetermine which ACP products have\nenforceable sales which are 75 percent or more of the gross New York State\nsales.

The enforceable sales records shall be provided to the director, Division\nof Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation no later than the\ncompliance period dates specified in clause ('a') of this subparagraph; and\n('c')\nfor a small business or a\none-product business which will be relying to some extent on surplus trading to\nmeet its ACP limits, a written commitment from the responsible ACP party(ies)\nthat they will transfer the surplus reductions to the small business or\none-product business upon approval of the ACP; and\n('d')\nfor each ACP product, all VOC content\nlevels which will be applicable for the ACP product during each compliance\nperiod. The plan shall also identify the specific method(s) by which the VOC\ncontent will be determined and the statistical accuracy and precision\n(repeatability and reproducibility) calculated for each specified method; and\n('e')\nthe projected enforceable\nsales for each ACP product at each different VOC content for every compliance\nperiod that the ACP will be in effect; and\n('f')\na detailed demonstration showing t he\ncombination of specific ACP reformulations or surplus trading (if applicable)\nthat is sufficient to ensure that the ACP emissions will not exceed the ACP\nlimit for each compliance period that the ACP will be in effect, the\napproximate date within each compliance period that such reformulations or\nsurplus trading are expected to occur, and the extent to which the VOC contents\nof the ACP products will be reduced ('i.e.', by ACP reformulation). This\ndemonstration shall use the equations specified in Subparts 235-2 and 235-3 of\nthis Part for projecting the ACP emissions and ACP limits during each\ncompliance period. This demonstration shall also include all VOC content levels\nand projected enforceable sales for all ACP products to be sold in the State of\n\nNew York during each compliance period; and\n('g')\na certification that all reductions in\nthe VOC content of a product will be real, actual reductions that do not result\nfrom changing product names, mischaracterizing ACP product reformulations that\nhave occurred in the past, or any other attempts to circumvent the provisions\nof this Part; and\n('h')\nwritten\nexplanations of the date-codes that will be displayed on each ACP product's\ncontainer or packaging; and\n('i')\na\nstatement of the approximate dates by which the responsible ACP party plans to\nmeet the applicable VOC content limit for each product in the ACP; and\n('j')\nan operational plan\n(reconciliation of shortfalls plan) which commits the responsible ACP party to\ncompletely reconcile any shortfalls in any and all cases, even, to the extent\npermitted by law, if the responsible ACP party files for bankruptcy protection. The plan for reconciliation of shortfalls shall contain all of the following: ('1')\na clear and convincing demonstration of\nhow shortfalls of up to five percent, 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 50\npercent, 75 percent and 100 percent of the applicable ACP limit will be\ncompletely reconciled within 90 working days from the date the shortfall is\ndetermined; and\n('2')\na listing of\nthe specific records and other information that will be necessary to verify\nthat the shortfalls were reconciled as specified in this clause; and\n('3')\na commitment to provide any record or\ninformation requested by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation to verify that the shortfalls have been completely\nreconciled; (viii)\na declaration, signed by a legal\nrepresentative for the responsible ACP party, which states that all information\nand operational plans submitted with the ACP application are true and\ncorrect. (2)\n(i) In accordance with the time periods\nspecified in subdivision (d) of this section, the director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall issue an ACP\nagreement approving an ACP which meets the requirements of this Part. The\ndirector, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation\nshall specify such terms and conditions as are necessary to ensure that the\nemissions from the ACP products do not exceed the emissions that would have\noccurred if the ACP products subject to the ACP had met the VOC content limits\nspecified in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. The ACP shall also include: ('a')\nonly\nthose ACP products for which the enforceable sales are at least 75 percent of\nthe gross New York State sales, as determined in clause (iv)('e') of this\nparagraph; ('b')\na reconciliation\nof shortfalls plan meeting the requirements of this Part; and\n('c')\noperational terms, conditions, and data\nto be reported to the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation to ensure that all requirements of this Part are\nmet; (ii)\n\nThe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall not\napprove an ACP submitted by a responsible ACP party if the director, Division\nof Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation determines, upon\nreview of the responsible ACP party's compliance history with past or current\nACPs or the requirements for consumer products in Subparts 235-1 through 235-11\nof this Part, that the responsible ACP party has a recurring pattern of\nviolations and has consistently refused to take the necessary steps to correct\nthose violations. (d) 'ACP approval time frames'. (1)\n\nThe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall take appropriate action on an\nACP within the following time periods: (i) Within 30 working days of receipt of an ACP application, the director, Division\nof Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall inform the\napplicant in writing that either: ('a')\nthe\napplication is complete and accepted for filing; or\n('b')\nthe application is deficient, and\nidentify the specific information required to make the application\ncomplete; (ii)\n\nWithin 30\nworking days of receipt of additional information provided in response to a\ndetermination that an ACP application is deficient, the director, Division of\n\nAir Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall inform the\napplicant in writing that either: ('a')\nthe\nadditional information is sufficient to make the application complete, and the\napplication is accepted for filing; or\n('b')\nthe application is deficient, and\nidentify the specific information required to make the application\ncomplete; (iii)\n\nIf the\ndirector, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation\nfinds that an application meets the requirements of subdivision (c) of this\nsection, then he or she shall issue an ACP agreement in accordance with the\nrequirements of this Part. The director, Division of Air Resources, Department\nof Environmental Conservation shall act to approve or disapprove a complete\napplication within 90 working days after the application is deemed\ncomplete.

(2)\n\nFalse reporting of\nany information contained in an ACP application, or any supporting\ndocumentation or amendments thereto, shall constitute a single, separate\nviolation of the requirements of this Part for each day that the approved ACP\nis in effect. (3)\n\nAny exceedance\nduring the applicable compliance period of the VOC content specified for an ACP\nproduct in the ACP agreement approving an ACP shall constitute a single, separate violation of the requirements of this Part for each ACP product which\nexceeds the specified VOC content that is sold, supplied, offered for sale, or\nmanufactured for use in the State of New York. (4)\n\nAny of the following actions shall each\nconstitute a single, separate violation of the requirements of this Part for\neach day after the applicable deadline until the requirement is satisfied: (i) failure to report data ('i.e.', missing\ndata) or failure to report data accurately ('i.e.', inaccurate data) in writing\nto the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation regarding the VOC content, LVP content, enforceable sales, or any\nother information required by any deadline specified in the applicable ACP\nagreement; (ii)\nfalse reporting of\nany information submitted to the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation for determining compliance with the\nACP requirements; (iii)\nfailure to\ncompletely implement the reconciliation of shortfalls plan that is set forth in\nthe ACP agreement, within 30 working days from the date of written notification\nof a shortfall by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation; and\n(iv)\nfailure to completely reconcile the\nshortfall as specified in the ACP agreement, within 90 working days from the\ndate of written notification of a shortfall by the director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation. (5)\n\nFalse reporting or failure to report any\nof the information specified in subparagraph (g)(2)(ix) of this section, or the\nsale or transfer of invalid surplus reductions, shall constitute a single, separate violation of the requirements of this Part for each day during the\ntime period for which the surplus reductions are claimed to be valid. (6)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (7) of\nthis subdivision, any exceedance of the ACP limit for any compliance period\nthat the ACP is in effect shall constitute a single, separate violation of the\nrequirements of this Part for each day of the applicable compliance period. The\ndirector, division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation\nshall determine whether an exceedance of the ACP limit has occurred as follows: (i) if the responsible ACP party has provided\nall required information for the applicable compliance period specified in the\nACP agreement approving an ACP, then the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall determine whether an exceedance\nhas occurred using the enforceable sales records and VOC content for each ACP\nproduct, as reported by the responsible ACP party for the applicable compliance\nperiod; (ii)\nif the responsible ACP\nparty has failed to provide all the required information specified in the ACP\nagreement for an applicable compliance period, the director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall determine whether an\nexceedance of the ACP limit has occurred as follows: ('a')\nfor the missing data days, the\ndirector, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation\nshall calculate the total maximum historical emissions, as specified in section\n235-2.1\n(fu)\nof\nthis Part; ('b')\nfor the remaining\nportion of the compliance period which are not missing data days, the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall\ncalculate the emissions for each ACP product using the enforceable sales\nrecords and VOC content that were reported for that portion of the applicable\ncompliance period; ('c')\nthe ACP\nemissions for the entire compliance period shall be the sum of the total\nmaximum historical emissions, determined pursuant to clause ('a') of this\nsubparagraph, and the emissions determined pursuant to clause ('b') of this\nsubparagraph; ('d')\nthe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall\ncalculate the ACP limit for the entire compliance period using the VOC content\nlimit applicable to each ACP product and the enforceable sales records\nspecified in clause ('b') of this subparagraph. The enforceable sales for each\nACP product during missing data days, as specified in clause ('a') of this\nsubparagraph, shall be zero; ('e')\nan exceedance of the ACP limit has occurred when the ACP emissions, determined\npursuant to clause ('c') of this subparagraph, exceeds the ACP limit, determined pursuant to clause ('d') of this subparagraph. (7)\n\nIf a violation specified in\nthis subdivision occurs, the responsible ACP party may, pursuant to this\nparagraph, establish the number of violations as calculated according to the\nfollowing equation: NEV = ( ACP Emissions - ACP Limit) × 1 Violation/40\n\nPounds where, NEV = number of ACP limit violations\nACP Emissions = the ACP emissions for the compliance\nperiod\nACP Limit = the ACP limit for the compliance\nperiod\n\nThe responsible ACP party may determine the number of ACP\nlimit violations pursuant to this paragraph only if it has provided all\nrequired information for the applicable compliance period, as specified in the\nACP agreement approving the ACP. By choosing this option, the responsible ACP\nparty waives any and all legal objections to the calculation of the ACP limit\nviolations pursuant to this paragraph. (8)\n\nIn assessing the amount of penalties for\nany violation occurring pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (7) of this\nsubdivision, the circumstances identified in applicable New York State health\nand safety laws and regulations shall be taken into consideration. (9)\nA cause of action against a responsible\nACP party under this Subpart shall be deemed to accrue on the date(s) when the\nrecords establishing a violation are received by the director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation. (10)\n\nThe responsible ACP party is fully\nliable for compliance with the requirements of this Part, even if the\nresponsible ACP party contracts with or otherwise relies on another person to\ncarry out some or all of the requirements of this Part. (g) 'Surplus reductions and surplus trading'. (1)\n\nThe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall issue surplus reduction\ncertificates which establish and quantify, to the nearest pound of VOC reduced, any surplus reductions achieved by a responsible ACP party operating under an\nACP. The surplus reductions can be bought from, sold to, or transferred to a\nresponsible ACP party operating under an ACP, as provided in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision. All surplus reductions shall be calculated by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation at the end\nof each compliance period within the time specified in the approved ACP. Surplus reduction certificates shall not constitute instruments, securities, or\nany other form of property. (2)\n\nThe\nissuance, use, and trading of all surplus reductions shall be subject to the\nfollowing provisions: (i) for the purposes of\nthis Part, VOC reductions from sources of VOCs other than consumer products\nsubject to the VOC content limits specified in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart may not be used to generate surplus reductions; (ii)\nsurplus reductions are valid only when\ngenerated by a responsible ACP party, and only while that responsible ACP party\nis operating under an approved ACP; (iii)\nsurplus reductions are valid only after\nthe director, division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation has issued an ACP agreement pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision; (iv)\nany surplus\nreductions issued by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation may be used by the responsible ACP party who\ngenerated the surplus until the reductions expire, are traded, or until the ACP\nis canceled pursuant to subdivision (k) of this section; (v) surplus reductions cannot be applied\nretroactively to any compliance period prior to the compliance period in which\nthe reductions were generated; (vi)\nexcept as provided in clause (vii)('b') of this paragraph, only small or\none-product businesses selling products under an approved ACP may purchase\nsurplus reductions. An increase in the size of a small business or one-product\nbusiness shall have no effect on surplus reductions purchased by that business\nprior to the date of the increase; (vii)\nwhile valid, surplus reductions can be\nused only for the following purposes: ('a')\nto adjust either the ACP emissions of either the responsible ACP party who\ngenerated the reductions or the responsible ACP party to which the reductions\nwere traded, provided the surplus reductions are not to be used by any\nresponsible ACP party to further lower its ACP emissions when its ACP emissions\nare equal to or less than the ACP limit during the applicable compliance\nperiod; or\n('b')\nto be traded for\nthe purpose of reconciling another responsible ACP party's shortfalls, provided\nsuch reconciliation is part of the reconciliation of shortfalls plan approved\nby the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation pursuant to clause (c)(1)(vii)('j') of this section; (viii)\na valid surplus reduction\ncertificate shall be in effect starting five days after the date of issuance by\nthe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation, for a continuous period equal to the number of days in the\ncompliance period during which the surplus reduction was generated. The surplus\nreduction shall then expire at the end of its effective period; (ix)\nat least five working days prior to the\neffective date of transfer of surplus reductions, both the responsible ACP\nparty which is selling surplus reductions and the responsible ACP party which\nis buying the surplus reductions shall, either together or separately, notify\nthe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation in writing of the transfer. The notification shall include all of\nthe following: ('a')\nthe date the transfer is\nto become effective; ('b')\nthe date\nthe surplus reductions being traded are due to expire; ('c')\nthe amount (in pounds of VOCs) of\nsurplus reductions that are being transferred; ('d')\nthe total purchase price paid by the\nbuyer for the surplus reductions; ('e')\nthe contact persons, names of the\ncompanies, street and mail addresses, and phone numbers of the responsible ACP\nparties involved in the trading of the surplus reductions; and\n('f')\na copy of the director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation-issued surplus reductions\ncertificate, signed by both the seller and buyer of the certificate, showing\ntransfer of all or a specified portion of the surplus reductions. The copy\nshall show the amount of any remaining non-traded surplus reductions, if\napplicable, and shall show their expiration date. The copy shall indicate that\nboth the buyer and seller of the surplus reductions fully understand the\nconditions and limitations placed upon the transfer of the surplus reductions\nand accept full responsibility for the appropriate use of such surplus\nreductions as provided in this Subpart; (x) surplus reduction certificates shall only\nbe traded between ACP product(s) for consumer products. (3)\n'Limited-use surplus reduction\ncertificates for early reformulations of ACP products'. (i) For the purposes of this paragraph, 'early reformulation' means an ACP product which is reformulated to result in a\nreduction in the product's VOC content, and which is sold, supplied, or offered\nfor sale in the State of New York for the first time during the one-year (365\nday) period immediately prior to the date on which the application for a\nproposed ACP is submitted to the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation. Early reformulation does not include\nany reformulated ACP products which are sold, supplied, or offered for sale in\nthe State of New York more than one year prior to the date on which the ACP\napplication is submitted to the director, Division of Air Resources, Department\nof Environmental Conservation. (ii)\n\nIf requested in the application for a proposed ACP, the director, Division of\n\nAir Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall, upon approval of\nthe ACP, issue surplus reduction certificates for early reformulation(s) of ACP\nproduct(s), provided that all of the following documentation has been provided\nby the responsible ACP party to the satisfaction of the director, Division of\n\nAir Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation: ('a')\naccurate documentation showing that the\nearly reformulation(s) reduced the VOC content of the ACP product(s) to a level\nwhich is below the pre-ACP VOC content of the product(s), or below the\napplicable VOC content limit(s) specified in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart, whichever is the lesser of the two; ('b')\naccurate documentation demonstrating\nthat the early reformulated ACP product(s) was sold in the State of New York\nretail outlets within the time period specified in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph; ('c')\naccurate sales\nrecords for the early reformulated ACP product(s) which meet the definition of\nenforceable sales records in section\n235-2.1\n(bl)\nof\nthis Part, and which demonstrate that the enforceable sales for the ACP\nproduct(s) are at least 75.0 percent of the gross New York State sales for the\nproduct(s), as specified in subparagraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section; ('d')\naccurate documentation for the early\nreformulated ACP product(s) which meets the requirements specified in\nsubparagraphs (c)(1)(iii) through (iv) of this section, clauses\n(c)(1)(vii)('g') through ('h') of this section, and subparagraph (c)(1)(viii)\nof this section, and which identifies the specific test methods for verifying\nthe claimed early reformulation(s) and the statistical accuracy and precision\nof the test methods as specified in clause (c)(1)(vii)('i') of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nSurplus\nreduction certificates issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be calculated\nseparately for each early reformulated ACP product by the director, Division of\n\nAir Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation according to the\nfollowing equation: Click to view\nimage\nwhere, SR = surplus reductions for the ACP product, expressed to\nthe nearest pound, Enforceable Sales = the enforceable sales for the early\nreformulated ACP product, expressed to the nearest pound of ACP product, ( VOC Content)\ninitial\n= the\npre-ACP VOC content of the ACP product, or the applicable VOC content limit\nspecified in Subpart 235-3.1 of this Part, whichever is the lesser of the two, expressed to the nearest 0.1 pounds of VOC per 100 pounds of ACP\nproduct, ( VOC Content)\nfinal\n= the VOC\ncontent of the early reformulated ACP product after the early reformulation is\nachieved, expressed to the nearest 0.1 pounds of VOC per 100 pounds of ACP\nproduct. (iv)\n\nThe use of\nsurplus reduction certificates issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be\nsubject to all of the following provisions: ('a')\nsurplus reduction certificates shall be\nused solely t o reconcile the responsible ACP party's shortfalls, if any, generated during the first compliance period occurring immediately after the\nissuance of the ACP agreement approving an ACP, and shall not be used for any\nother purpose; ('b')\nsurplus\nreduction certificates shall not be transferred to, or used by, any other\nresponsible ACP party; ('c')\nexcept\nas provided in this paragraph, surplus reduction certificates shall be subject\nto all requirements applicable to surplus reductions and surplus trading, as\nspecified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. (h) 'Reconciliation of\nshortfalls'. (1)\n\nAt the end of each\ncompliance period, the responsible ACP party shall make an initial calculation\nof any shortfalls occurring in that compliance period, as specified in the ACP\nagreement approving the ACP. Upon receipt of this information, the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall\ndetermine the amount of any shortfall that has occurred during the compliance\nperiod, and shall notify the responsible ACP party of this determination. (2)\n\nThe responsible ACP party\nshall implement the reconciliation of shortfalls plan as specified in the ACP\nagreement approving the ACP, within 30 working days from the date of written\nnotification of a shortfall by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation.
