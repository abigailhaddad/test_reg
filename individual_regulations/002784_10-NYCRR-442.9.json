  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.9 - Materiality\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1180 ]\nMateriality is an elusive concept\nwith the dividing line between material and immaterial amounts subject to\nvarious interpretations. It is clear, however, that an amount is material if\nits exclusion from the financial statements would cause misleading or incorrect\nconclusions to be drawn by users of the statements. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
