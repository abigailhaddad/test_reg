Tit. 22 § 131.3 - Application for audio-visual coverage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Coverage of judicial proceedings\nshall be permitted only upon order of the presiding trial judge approving an\noral or written application made by a representative of the news media for\npermission to conduct such coverage. (b) Upon receipt of an application, the\npresiding trial judge shall conduct such review as may be appropriate, including: (1)\nconsultation\nwith the news media applicant; (2)\nconsultation with counsel to all\nparties to the proceeding of which coverage is sought, who shall be responsible\nfor identifying any concerns or objections of the parties, prospective\nwitnesses, and victims, if any, with respect to the proposed coverage, and\nadvising the court thereof; (3)\nreview of all statements or\naffidavits presented to the presiding trial judge concerning the proposed\ncoverage. Where the proceedings of which coverage is\nsought involve a child, a victim, or a party, any of whom object to such\ncoverage, and in any other appropriate instance, the presiding trial judge may\nhold such conferences and conduct any direct inquiry as may be fitting. (c) Except as otherwise provided by law or\nsection\n131.7\nof this Part, consent of the\nparties or other participants in judicial proceedings of which coverage is\nsought is not required for approval of an application for such coverage. (d) In determining\nan application for coverage, the presiding trial judge shall consider all\nrelevant factors, including but not limited to: (1)\nthe type of case\ninvolved; (2)\nwhether the coverage would cause harm to any participant; (3)\nwhether the coverage would\ninterfere with the fair administration of justice, the advancement of a fair\ntrial, or the rights of the parties; (4)\nwhether the coverage would\ninterfere with any law enforcement activity; (5)\nwhether the proceedings would\ninvolve lewd or scandalous matters; (6)\nthe objections of any of the\nparties, victims or other participants in the proceeding of which coverage is\nsought; (7)\nthe\nphysical structure of the courtroom and the likelihood that any equipment\nrequired to conduct coverage of proceedings can be installed and operated\nwithout disturbance to those proceedings or any other proceedings in the\ncourthouse; and\n(8)\nthe extent to which the coverage would be barred by law in the judicial\nproceeding of which coverage is sought. The presiding trial judge also shall\nconsider and give great weight to the fact that any party, victim, or other\nparticipant in the proceeding is a child. (e) Following review of an\napplication for coverage of a judicial proceeding, the presiding trial judge, as soon as practicable, shall issue an order, in writing or on the record in\nopen court, approving such application, in whole or in part, or denying it. Such order shall contain any restrictions imposed by the judge on the\naudio-visual coverage and shall contain a statement advising the parties that\nany violation of the order is punishable by contempt pursuant to article 19 of\nthe Judiciary Law. Such order shall be included in the record of such\nproceedings and, unless it wholly approves the application and no party or\nvictim objected to coverage, it shall state the basis for its\ndetermination. (f) Before denying an application for coverage, the presiding trial judge shall\nconsider whether such coverage properly could be approved with the imposition\nof special limitations, including but not limited to: (1)\ndelayed broadcast of the\nproceedings subject to coverage provided, however, where delayed broadcast is\ndirected, it shall be only for the purpose of assisting the news media to\ncomply with the restrictions on coverage provided by law or by the presiding\ntrial judge; or\n(2)\nmodification or prohibition of video or audio-visual coverage of portions of\nthe proceedings.
