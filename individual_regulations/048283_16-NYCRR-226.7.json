At\neach meter location where the metered volume of gas is corrected to standard\nconditions, the correction shall be made by use of an appropriate approved type\nmeter and/or correction device. For this purpose, standard conditions shall be\n14.73 pounds per square inch absolute and 60° F. All meter installations\nmeasuring at delivery pressures in excess of 30 pounds per square inch gauge\nshall have their measurement recordings corrected for supercompressibility or\nassure the same accuracy as specified for meters with correction devices in\nsection\n226.6\n(b) (4)\nof\nthis Part.
