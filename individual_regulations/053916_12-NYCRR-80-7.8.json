Tit. 12 §§ 80-7.8 - Test procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Mount the specimen horizontally on the support frame with the sewn sides and\nend held at a one-inch thickness by the U-shaped hold-down plate, spacers and\nclamps. (b) Attach two #50 white\nmercerized cotton threads to one edge of the frame at points 11/2 inches and\n111/2 inches back from the open end, i.e., with 10 inches in between, and\nstretch across the sample, attaching small weights to the overhanging ends of\nthe threads. Timing will begin and end as the respective threads burn through\nand their weights drop. (c) With\nthe flame adjusted in accordance with subdivision (h) of section\n80-7.6\nof this Part and the frame\nwith mounted specimen in the test cabinet, position the burner so that the\ncenter of the burner tip is 3/4 inch below the center of the edge of the\nexposed end of the specimen. (d) Lower the door of the test cabinet. (e) Expose the sample to the flame for 30\nseconds to force ignition. Note: The most reproducible results are produced when the fan\nin the hood is turned off, or down if a variable speed fan is used, during the\n30 second ignition period. During this time it is desirable that the burner\nflame not flicker. Following the ignition period the fan should be turned back\nup to exhaust fumes, yet not cause a draft in the test cabinet. (f) Begin timing when the first\nweight drops and continue until the second weight drops or until the flaming\nstops. (g) Calculate the burn rate\nusing the following formula: B = 60 × D/T\nNote: B = Burn rate in inches per minute\nD = Distance the flame travels in inches, and\nT = Time in seconds for the flame to travel D\ninches.
