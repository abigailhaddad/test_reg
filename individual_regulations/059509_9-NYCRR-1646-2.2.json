  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-2.2 - Preparation of development cost budget\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe specimen form of Development Cost Budget (form\nDH-512) is shown as Exhibits 1 and 2 of Appendix S-11. Each development cost\nbudget shall be supported by a development cost budget justification which may, in the case of a preliminary budget, be submitted separately from the\napplication for financial assistance. The division will be glad to render\nassistance in the preparation of development cost budgets. The instructions in\nthis Subchapter are confined, primarily, to the relations of the budgets to the\nreports, schedules and forms described herein. The following comments are\nintended for purposes of clarification: (a) The heading of the budget should indicate\nwhether the budget is a preliminary, final, or bond sale budget. (b) Date prepared refers to the date that the\nbudget has been prepared by the local agency and is used to further identify\nthe budget. The date prepared need not necessarily be the same as the date of\nthe loan contract or of the application for financial assistance or amendments\nthereto. (c) Loan contract dated\nrefers to the date of the execution of the loan contract and not to the date of\nthe commissioner's approval thereof. The date of execution of the loan contract\nwill ordinarily be found in the very first paragraph of the contract. (d) As amended to similarly refers to the\ndate of execution of the most recent amendment, if any, to the loan\ncontract. (e) Columns (2) and (3)\nof the form are reserved for such analysis of the total estimated development\ncost as the division may require. For example, where slum clearance is\ninvolved, the division may require that the slum clearance costs be segregated\nin column (2) and other development costs in column (3). The analysis, if any, in columns (2) and (3) shall not be reflected in the books of account or in the\nrelated forms submitted to the division (see §\n1646-2.3, subd. [a], below). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-2.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
