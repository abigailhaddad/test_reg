  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2004.6 - Limitation and termination\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Scope\nand duration. A limitation may be imposed upon a finding that it is necessary\nto correct or remedy any violation found to have occurred, assure that it does\nnot recur, or to penalize the institution for having committed such violation. Termination may be imposed upon a finding that the institution has knowingly\ncommitted fraud, has acted with gross or wanton negligence in the\nadministration of the loan program, has violated a rule or regulation as a\nresult of which a substantial loss of student, lender or government funds has\noccurred, or has a history of repeated violations of the same or different\nrules and regulations causing loss of student, lender or government funds. A\nlimitation or termination may extend to all aspects of an institution's or\nlender's participation in programs under this Chapter or may be limited to\nportions thereof. The duration of a limitation may be set to extend for a\ndefinite period of time or until the president has determined that the basis\nfor the limitation has been removed and that a repetition of such violation\nappears unlikely. An institution or lender which has been limited or terminated\nmay subsequently seek reinstatement of its full eligibility to participate in\nprograms under this Chapter pursuant to section\n2004.7\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (b) Procedures. (1)\nA limitation or termination may be\ninitiated whether or not suspension proceedings have been initiated under\nsection\n2004.5\nof this Part. Limitation or\ntermination procedures shall be initiated by the president mailing to the\ninstitution or lender in question a notice, by certified mail with return\nreceipt requested: (i) informing the\ninstitution or lender of the corporation's intent to limit or terminate the\ninstitution's or lender's eligibility, the nature of any proposed limitation\nand the basis of such action; (ii)\nspecifying the proposed effective date for the limitation or termination and\nthe consequences of such action; and\n(iii)\ninforming the institution or lender of\nits rights, if exercised within a stated period of time, to submit written\nmaterial and to request a hearing before the limitation or termination takes\neffect. The notice shall also provide information pertaining to this proceeding\nas the president may determine to be appropriate. The notice shall also invite\nvoluntary efforts to correct the violation which led to the initiation of this\naction. (2)\n\nExcept as\nprovided in subdivision (c) of this section, the proposed effective date of\nlimitation or termination shall not be less than 21 days after the notice of\nintent has been sent. The period of time within which the institution or lender\nmay submit written material or request a hearing shall not be less than 15 days\nafter such notice has been sent. If a hearing requested by the institution or\nlender cannot be held prior to the proposed effective date of the limitation or\ntermination, the date shall be extended until the completion of such\nproceedings. (3)\n\nIf the institution\nor lender does not request a hearing, the president may, after considering any\nwritten material submitted on a timely basis by the institution or lender, dismiss the matter or notify the institution or lender that it has been limited\nor terminated. (4)\n\nIf the\ninstitution or lender requests a hearing within the time permitted, such\nhearing shall be conducted as promptly as possible by the presiding officer\npursuant to the provisions of Part 2005 of this Chapter. (c) Effect of prior proceedings. If any\nproceedings have been previously initiated under this Subchapter against an\ninstitution or lender at the time limitation or termination proceedings are\ninitiated, such proceedings need not duplicate the previous proceedings. Any\nmatters resolved under the previous proceedings shall be considered final and\nany hearings undertaken in the subsequent limitation or termination proceedings\nshall be limited to new evidence or new issues; provided, however, that the\npresiding officer may, in his or her discretion, agree to reconsider matters\npreviously resolved. Moreover, the time schedules set forth in paragraphs\n(b)(2), (4) and (5) of this section may be shortened to reflect the previous\nproceedings in such manner as the presiding officer may deem\nappropriate.
