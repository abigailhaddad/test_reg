  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6210.18 - Three-percent audit\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As required by NYS Election Law, section 9-211, the Board of Elections or a\nbipartisan team appointed by such board shall manually count all votes of the\nvoter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) from no less than three percent of\neach type of voting machine or system used within the county, provided, however, that there shall be a manual count of at least one of each type of\nvoting machine or system used therein for each public office and any questions\nor proposals appearing on the ballot. The conduct of such random audit shall be\nin a manner consistent with procedures prescribed by the State Board of\n\nElections. (b) The voting machines\nor systems to be audited to meet the county-wide minimum requirement set forth\nin subdivision (a) of this section shall be selected by lot through a\ntransparent, random, manual process where all selections of machines or systems\nused in the county are equally probable. The voting machines or systems to be\naudited to meet the requirements for a specific contest set forth in\nsubdivision (a) of this section shall be selected by lot through a transparent, random, manual process where all selections of machines or systems used in the\ncontest within each county are equally probable. The county boards shall adopt\none of the random, manual selection methods prescribed by the State Board of\n\nElections or such county board may submit for approval by the State Board a\nproposed alternative random, manual selection method. County board adoption of\nthe prescribed random, manual selection method shall take place not later than\n45 days after the purchase of a voting system and notice by the county board of\nthe adoption of such random, manual selection method shall be filed with the\n\nState Board. (1)\n\nAs required by NYS Election\n\nLaw, section 9-211, not less than five days prior to the time fixed for the\nrandom selection process, the Board of Elections shall send notice by first\nclass mail to each candidate, political party and independent body entitled to\nhave had watchers present at the polls in any election district in such board's\njurisdiction and to the State Board. Such notice shall state the time and place\nfixed for such random selection process. Such random selection process shall\nnot occur until after election day. Each candidate, political party or\nindependent body entitled to appoint watchers to attend at a polling place\nshall be entitled to appoint such number of watchers to observe the random\nselection process and the subsequent audit. (2)\n\nSuch notice shall also announce the date, time, and location that the audit shall commence, information on the number of\naudit teams which will conduct such audit, and such other information that the\ncounty board deems necessary. (3)\n\nThe county board shall at a single session randomly select from all machines\nand systems used within the county in the election so that no further drawings\nare required if anomalies are encountered during the manual audit. The audit\nshall commence on the same day as the random, manual selection\nprocess. (4)\n\nPrior to auditing the\naudit records, the county board shall distribute to those in attendance at the\naudit session, copies of the list showing the number of machines and systems\nneeded to meet the audit requirement and the unofficial vote results per voting\nmachine or system selected for audit. (c) For each voting machine or system subject\nto be audited, the manual audit shall consist of a manual tabulation of the\nvoter verifiable paper audit trail records and a comparison of such count, with\nrespect to all candidates and any questions or proposals appearing on the\nballot, with the electronic vote tabulation reported for such election\ndistrict. (1)\nA reconciliation report, on a\nform prescribed by the State Board of Elections, that reports and compares the\nmanual and electronic vote tabulations for each audited candidate for each\ncontest and any question or proposal from each machine or system subject to the\naudit by election district, including tallies of overvotes, undervotes, blank\nballots, spoiled ballots and rejections recorded on the VVPAT, along with any\ndiscrepancies, shall be prepared by the board of elections or a bipartisan team\nappointed by such board and signed by such members of the audit team. (2)\n\nAny discrepancies between the\ncorresponding audit results and initial electronic vote counts shall be duly\nnoted, along with a description of the actions taken by the county board of\nelections for resolution of discrepancies. The number and type of any damaged\nor missing paper records shall be duly noted. (3)\n\nIf any unresolved discrepancy is detected\nbetween the manual count described in this subdivision and the machine or\nsystem electronic count, even an unresolved discrepancy of a single vote, the\nmanual count shall be conducted a second time on such machine or system to\nconfirm the discrepancy. (d) The reconciliation report required in\nsubdivision (c) of this section shall be transmitted to the county board\ncommissioners or their designees upon completion of the initial phase of the\naudit for determination on the expansion of the audit conducted pursuant to\nsubdivisions (e) through (g) of this section. (e) The county board shall aggregate the\naudit results reported pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section that are\napplicable to any contests, questions or proposals. The aggregated results for\neach contest, question or proposal shall be used to determine whether further\nauditing is required as follows: (1)\n\nFor any\ncontest, question or proposal, an expanded audit will be required if either or\nboth of the following criteria apply to the aggregated audit results: (i) any one or more discrepancies between the\nconfirming manual counts described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and the\noriginal machine or system electronic counts, which taken together, would alter\nthe vote share of any candidate, question or proposal by 0.1 percent or more of\nthe hand counted votes for respective contests, questions or proposals in the\nentire sample; or\n(ii)\nif\ndiscrepancies of any amount are detected between the confirming manual count\ndescribed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and the original machine or\nsystem electronic count from at least 10 percent of the machines or systems\ninitially audited then the board or bipartisan team appointed by such board\nshall manually count the votes recorded on all the voter verifiable paper audit\ntrail records from no less than an additional five percent of each type of the\nsame type of voting machine or system which contains any such discrepancy or\ndiscrepancies; (iii)\nwhen\ndetermining whether discrepancies warrant expanding the audit, the\npercentage-based thresholds in this section shall be rounded down by truncating\nthe decimal portion (with a minimum of one). (f) A further expansion of the audit will be\nrequired if either or both of the following criteria apply to the audit\nresults: (1)\n\nFor each contest, question or\nproposal, the county board shall aggregate the results from the initial audit\nas required in subdivision (a) of this section and the expanded five percent\naudit. If, such aggregated results of unresolved discrepancies satisfy the\ncriteria in subparagraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, a further expansion of the\naudit will be required. (2)\n\nFor\neach contest, question or proposal, the county board shall take the results of\nthe five percent expanded audit under subdivision (e) of this section, and, if\nsuch results of unresolved discrepancies satisfy the criteria in subparagraph\n(e)(1)(ii) of this section, a further expansion of the audit will be\nrequired. (3)\n\nWhen an expanded\naudit is required for a contest pursuant to this section, each county board or\nbipartisan team appointed by such board shall manually count all voter\nverifiable paper audit trail records from no less than an additional 12 percent\nof each type of the same type of voting machine or system which contains any\nsuch discrepancy or discrepancies. (4)\n\nWhen determining whether discrepancies\nwarrant expanding the audit, all percentage-based thresholds in this section\nshall be rounded down by truncating the decimal portion (with a minimum of\none). (g) A further\nexpansion of the audit will be required if either or both of the following\ncriteria apply to the audit results: (1)\n\nFor\neach contest, question or proposal, the county board shall aggregate the\nresults from the initial audit as required in subdivision (a) of this section\nand the expanded audit as required in subdivisions (e) and (f) of this section. If, such aggregated results of unresolved discrepancies satisfy the criteria in\nsubparagraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, a further expansion of the audit will\nbe required. (2)\n\nFor each contest, question or proposal, the county board shall take the results of the 12 percent\nexpanded audit under subdivision (f) of this section, and, if such results of\nunresolved discrepancies satisfy the criteria in subparagraph (e)(1)(ii) of\nthis section, a further expansion of the audit will be required. (3)\n\nWhen an expanded audit is required for a\ncontest pursuant to this section, each county board shall manually count all\nvoter verifiable paper audit trail records from all the remaining unaudited\nmachines and systems where the contest appeared on the ballot. (4)\n\nWhen determining whether discrepancies\nwarrant expanding the audit, all percentage-based thresholds in this section\nshall be rounded down by truncating the decimal portion (with a minimum of\none). (h) The standards\nset forth in subdivisions (a)-(g) of this section are not intended to describe\nthe only circumstances for a partial or full manual count of the voter\nverifiable paper audit record, but instead are designed to set a uniform\nstatewide standard under which such hand counts must be performed. The county\nboards of elections, as well as the courts, retain the authority to order\nmanual counts of those records in whole or in part under such other and\nadditional circumstances as they deem warranted. In doing so, they should take\ninto consideration: (1)\nwhether the\ndiscrepancies were exclusively or predominantly found on one type of voting\nmachine or system; (2)\nthe size of\nthe discrepancies; (3)\nthe number\nof discrepancies; (4)\nthe\npercentage of machines or systems with discrepancies; (5)\nthe number and distribution of unusable\nvoter-verified paper audit trail records as described in subdivision (j) of\nthis section; (6)\nthe number of\ncancellations recorded on the voter-verified paper audit trail records reported\npursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and\n(7)\nwhether, when projected to a full audit, the discrepancies detected (no matter how small) might alter the outcome of the\ncontest, question or proposal result. (i) If the audit officials are unable to\nreconcile the manual count with the electronic vote tabulation on a voting\nmachine or system, then the Board of Elections shall conduct such further\ninvestigation of the discrepancies as may be necessary for the purpose of\ndetermining whether or not to certify the election results, expand the audit, or prohibit that voting machine or system's use in such jurisdiction. (j) If a complete audit is conducted, the\nresults of such audit shall be used by the canvassing board in making the\nstatement of canvass and determinations of persons elected and propositions\napproved or rejected. The results of a partial audit shall not be used in lieu\nof voting machine or system tabulations, unless a voting machine or system is\nfound to have failed to record votes in a manner indicating an operational\nfailure. When such operational failure is found, the board of county canvassers\nshall use the voter verifiable audit records to determine the votes cast on\nsuch machine or system, provided such records were not also impaired by the\noperational failure of the voting machine or system. If the voter verified\npaper audit trail records in any machine or system selected for an audit are\nfound to be unusable for an audit for any reason whatsoever, another machine or\nsystem used in the same contest shall be selected at random by the county board\nto replace the original machine or system in the audit sample. All such\nselections shall be made randomly in the presence of those observing the audit. The county board shall inquire in an effort to determine the reason the voter\nverified paper audit trail records were compromised and unusable and such\ninquiry shall begin as soon as practicable. The results of the inquiry shall be\nmade public upon completion. (k) Any anomaly in the manual audit shall be reported to and be on a form\nprescribed by the State Board and shall accompany the certified election\nresults. (l) Notwithstanding any\nother provision of this section, voting machines or systems used for early\nvoting shall be separately audited pursuant to this subdivision and the\nprovisions of this section not inconsistent with this subdivision after the\ndate of the election. For purposes of selecting the voting machine(s) or\nsystem(s) used in early voting to be audited, each separate memory storage\ndevice containing election results, exclusive of any redundant memory storage\ndevices, used during early voting from which a result tape is generated shall\nbe considered a separate voting machine or system for purpose of the audit. As\nprovided by the procedures of the state board of elections and the provisions\nof this Part consistent with this subdivision, initially three percent of such\nvoting machines or systems used for early voting shall be audited in addition\nto the initial audit of three percent of voting machines or systems used on\nelection day as provided for in subdivision (a) of this section. The audit\nexpansion steps for ballots voted early shall be the same as for other ballots, and both early voted ballots and all other ballots counted by machine shall be\nincluded in any full manual count conducted pursuant to this section. The cast\nballots corresponding to each memory storage device containing election results\nshall be kept together and not intermingled with any other voted ballots. This\nsubdivision is applicable in relation to any election at which early voting is\nheld pursuant to title VI of article 8 of the election law as enacted by\nchapter 6 of the laws of 2019.
