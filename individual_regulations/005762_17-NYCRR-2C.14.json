  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.14 - Advisory Exit and Ramp Speed Signs (W13-2 and W13-3)\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraphs 04, 07, 08, and Figure 2C-3. INSERT the following paragraphs and Figure NY2C-3: Guidance: 05A The Advisory Ramp Speed sign should be used only on a\nramp that is not an exit ramp, or on an exit ramp for a curve that is\ndownstream of the initial curve. Option: 06A Where there is a need to remind road users of the\nrecommended advisory speed, a Combination Horizontal Alignment/Advisory Speed\nsign (W1-1a or W1-2a) sign may be installed at or beyond the beginning of the\nexit curve or on the outside of the curve, provided that it is obvious that the\nsign applies only to exiting traffic. These signs may also be used at\nintermediate points along the ramp, especially if the ramp curvature changes\nand the subsequent curves on the ramp have a different advisory speed than the\ninitial exit curve. Support: 06B Figure NY2C-3 shows an example of advisory speed\nsigning for an exit ramp. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
