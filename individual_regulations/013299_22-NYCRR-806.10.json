  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 806.10 - Mental incapacity of attorney; protection of clients of disbarred and suspended attorneys\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Proceeding to determine alleged\nincapacity of attorney. Whenever, during the investigation of a complaint of\nprofessional misconduct or the prosecution of a disciplinary proceeding against\nan attorney, it shall appear that the attorney is incapacitated from continuing\nto practice law by reason of mental illness, drug addiction or alcoholism, or\nis otherwise mentally irresponsible, it shall be the duty of the chief attorney\nto petition the court to take appropriate action for determination of the\nattorney's mental condition, including examination by such qualified medical\nexperts as the court shall designate. If the court is satisfied from the\nevidence that the attorney is so incapacitated, it shall suspend him from\npractice for such mental incapacity indefinitely and until further order, and\nany pending proceedings against him shall be held in abeyance. The court may\nappoint counsel to represent the attorney, if he lacks adequate\nrepresentation. (b) Procedure when respondent claims disability during course of disciplinary\nproceeding. If during the court of a disciplinary proceeding, respondent\ncontends that he is suffering from a disability by reason of mental infirmity\nor illness, or because of addiction to drugs or intoxicants which makes it\nimpossible for him adequately to defend himself, the court thereupon shall\nenter an order suspending respondent from continuing to practice law until a\ndetermination is made of the respondent's capacity to do so. (c) Expenses of proceedings. The court may fix the compensation of any attorney or medical expert appointed\npursuant to this section and direct that payment be made as an incident of the\nexpenses of a disciplinary proceeding.
