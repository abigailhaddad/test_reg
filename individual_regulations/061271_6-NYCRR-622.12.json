  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 622.12 - Motion for order without hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\nlieu of or in addition to a notice of hearing and complaint, department staff\nmay serve a motion for order without hearing together with supporting\naffidavits reciting all the material facts and other available documentary\nevidence. Simultaneously with the service of the motion for order without\nhearing or as soon as practical thereafter, department staff must file with the\n\nChief ALJ a copy of the motion and supporting papers together with proof of\nservice on each respondent. (1)\nA motion for\norder without hearing in lieu of complaint must be served in the manner\nprescribed in paragraph 622.3(a)(3) of this Part and comply with the\nrequirements of paragraph 622.3(a)(1) of this Part. (2)\nA motion for order without hearing served\nafter jurisdiction has been obtained over respondent by service of a notice of\nhearing and complaint must be served in the manner prescribed in subdivision\n622.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (3)\nA motion for order\nwithout hearing served after service of a notice of hearing and complaint may\namend the pleadings subject to the requirements of section\n622.5\nof this Part. (b) A motion for order without\nhearing in lieu of complaint must include a statement that a response must be\nfiled with the assigned ALJ, or if no ALJ has been assigned to the proceeding, the Chief ALJ, within twenty (20) days after each respondent's receipt of the\nmotion, and that the failure to respond to the motion constitutes a\ndefault. (c) Within twenty (20)\ndays of receipt of a motion for order without hearing, each respondent must\nfile with the assigned ALJ, or if no ALJ has been assigned to the proceeding, the Chief ALJ and serve on department staff a response to the motion, which\nmust include supporting affidavits and other available documentary evidence. A\nresponse to a motion for order without hearing in lieu of complaint must\nexplicitly assert any affirmative defenses consistent with subdivision\n622.4\n(c) of this\n\nTitle. When it appears from affidavits and documentary evidence filed in\nopposition to the motion that facts essential to justify opposition may exist\nbut cannot then be stated, the assigned ALJ may deny the motion or order a\ncontinuance to permit the submission of the essential facts, and may make such\nother rulings as may be just and proper. (d) A motion for order without hearing will\nbe granted if, upon all the papers and proof filed, the cause of action or\ndefense is established sufficiently to warrant granting summary judgment under\nthe CPLR in favor of any party. Likewise, where the motion includes several\ncauses of action, the motion may be granted in part as to one or more causes of\naction or any defense thereto if it is determined the cause of action or\ndefense is established sufficiently to warrant the grant of summary judgment. Upon determining that the motion should be granted, in whole or in part, the\nALJ will prepare a report and submit it to the commissioner pursuant to section\n622.18\nof this Part. (e) A motion for order without hearing will\nbe denied with respect to particular causes of action if any party shows the\nexistence of one or more triable issues of fact requiring a hearing. If a\nmotion for order without hearing is denied, the ALJ may, if practicable, ascertain what facts are not in dispute or are established as a matter of law\nby examining the evidence filed, interrogating a party or a party's attorney or\nrepresentative, or directing a conference. The ALJ will thereupon make a ruling\ndenying the motion and specifying those facts, if any, that will be deemed\nestablished for all purposes in the hearing. Where the motion for order without\nhearing is in lieu of complaint, upon the issuance of such a ruling, the moving\nand responsive papers will be deemed the complaint and answer, respectively, and the hearing will proceed pursuant to this Part. (f) The existence of a triable issue of fact\nregarding the amount of civil penalties or remedial relief requested will not\nbar the granting of a motion for an order without hearing on liability. If the\nonly triable issues of fact arising on a motion for order without hearing\nrelate to the amount of civil penalties or remedial relief requested, the ALJ\nwill schedule the matter for a hearing to determine the amount of civil\npenalties or appropriate remedial relief to be recommended to the\ncommissioner.
