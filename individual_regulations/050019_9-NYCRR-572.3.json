A\ngeneral description of the proposed project and general information concerning\nthe project site should be provided. A sponsor may also request written\nrecommendations from agency staff. (b) (1)\n\nAny\nproject sponsor of a proposed large scale project may after preliminary\nconsultations and informal assessment with staff as provided in subdivision (a)\nof this section request preapplication conceptual review by the regulatory\nprograms committee. (2)\n\nRequests\nfor preapplication conceptual review shall be submitted in writing to the\ndeputy director- regulatory programs. The request shall include identification\nof the project site and a statement of the goal(s) of the project, and any\nreasonable alternative preliminary project designs which also achieve the\nproject goal(s). Should a project sponsor believe that no reasonable\nalternatives exist which achieve the project goal(s), the project sponsor may\ninclude a statement describing the reasons for such a conclusion. Upon receipt\nof a conceptual review request, agency staff may provide an individualized\nrequest for additional information regarding the project and any reasonable\nalternatives which would achieve the project goal(s). Agency staff shall also\npublish notice of the request for conceptual review in the Environmental Notice\n\nBulletin. (3)\n\nThe staff shall, within 45 calendar days, review the materials once all the information agreed\nto has been submitted and formulate recommendations to the regulatory programs\ncommittee. The agency may solicit public comment on the project sponsor's\nmaterials and the recommendations of staff. The staff recommendations to the\nregulatory programs committee shall include consideration of the calculation of\nthe overall intensity guidelines, the compatibility of the project with the\nland use area and community, and potential impacts of any alternatives under\nconsideration. The staff shall also recommend its preferred alternative, shall\nidentify any issues that should be addressed in the permit application as can\nbe identified in the information provided, suggest guidelines for the\ndevelopment of the final plan, and make any other recommendations relevant to\nimpacts and approvability of the project or alternatives. (4)\n\nShould staff conclude, within 45 calendar\ndays, that a project sponsor has provided insufficient information as part of a\nrequest for conceptual review specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, staff shall recommend to the regulatory programs committee that the committee\ndeny the applicant's request for conceptual review. The recommendation shall\nspecify the deficiency of the information provided regarding the project site, goal(s) of the project, and/or reasonable alternative preliminary project\ndesigns. (5)\n\nThe request for\npreapplication conceptual review and the staff recommendation shall be\npresented to the regulatory programs committee, which shall consider the matter\nat a regularly scheduled meeting at which members of the general public are\ninvited to be heard. The agency shall provide reasonable prior notice to the\npublic of such meeting and of the opportunity to be heard. After the meeting, and the expiration of an additional 30-day period for public comment, the\ncommittee shall provide its recommendations in writing. (6)\n\nThe members of the committee shall\nendeavor, through the formulation of consensus recommendations, to provide the\nproject sponsor as much guidance as possible in the design of the project to\nconform with pertinent approval criteria. (7)\n\nThe amount and value of guidance which\ncan be expected in preliminary consultations and conceptual review is dependent\non the quality of the information provided. In this respect such information\n(including when requested permission to enter upon the project site) will be\ncritical to that guidance; and, thus should be provided as soon as reasonably\npractical. (c) Plans and\ninformation provided by the project sponsor shall not be binding upon the\nproject sponsor; nor shall findings or recommendations by the agency staff for\npurposes of this section constitute authorization to commence the project and\nshall not be binding upon the agency with respect to any subsequent permit\napplication or other approval for the proposed project.
