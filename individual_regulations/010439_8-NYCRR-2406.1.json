  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2406.1 - Eligibility for further financial aid after default\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person in default on a previous loan\nmade, administered, or guaranteed by the corporation, or who has failed upon\ndemand to make a refund of an overpayment of a State award, at the sole\ndiscretion of the president, may be granted further awards, if the following\nconditions are met: (1)\nthe applicant has\ndemonstrated a present inability to pay the entire obligation in full, including by utilization of award offset procedures or otherwise; (2)\nthe applicant has entered into a\nsatisfactory repayment arrangement with the corporation and has made payments\nthereunder for a period of at least six months prior to the date the\napplication is filed. For purposes hereof, satisfactory repayment arrangements\nare those in which the applicant and the corporation have agreed to a specific\nmonthly payment amount. Payments will be deemed to have been satisfactorily\nmade for six months if each monthly payment has been voluntarily made on a\ntimely basis; and\n(3)\nin the case\nof a defaulted loan only, the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of\nthe president that, at the time of the default, he or she is eligible, but\nfailed to apply for, a deferment or forbearance. (b) In granting any application for new aid\nhereunder, or in awarding and disbursing such aid, the president may impose any\nor all of the following terms and conditions, as well as any other terms and\nconditions reasonably related to protecting the financial interest of the\ncorporation and the State of New York: (1)\nrequire payment to continue, in whole or in part, during the period the\napplicant is in school or in any grace period; (2)\nrequire a confession of\njudgment; (3)\nrequire that the\napplicant provide financial reports in such form and at such times as the\npresident shall require, and to make available his or her financial records, produce copies of tax returns, and provide an authorization in writing for the\ncorporation to obtain copies of such returns; (4)\nrequire the applicant to agree in writing\nto the terms and conditions imposed. (c) Application for such additional financial\naid hereunder shall be in writing and upon such form and in such manner as the\npresident may from time to time require. (d) The determination of the president shall\nbe deemed final agency action; however, nothing herein shall be construed as\nprohibiting a person from reapplying for relief hereunder for subsequent\nacademic periods if an application is denied. (e) In the event a recipient for further\nfinancial aid shall have filed a false application or shall breach any term or\ncondition of the award, the president may revoke the award and prohibit any\nremaining installment payments to be made thereunder, require the resumption of\npayments on the prior obligation, and take such further action as may be\npermitted under law or regulation to require the immediate payment of the new\naward effected under the provisions of this Part.
