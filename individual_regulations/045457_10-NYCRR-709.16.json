  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 709.16 - Therapeutic radiology or radiation oncology\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This methodology will be utilized to\nevaluate certificate of need applications involving the acquisition of\nmegavoltage (MEV) devices used in therapeutic radiology. It is the intent of\nthe State Hospital Review and Planning Council that this methodology, when used\nin conjunction with the planning standards and criteria set forth in section\n709.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of planning principles and decision making tools for directing the\ndistribution of MEV devices. The goals and objectives of the methodology\nexpressed herein are expected to ensure that an adequate number of therapeutic\nradiology units are available to provide access to care and avoid the\nunnecessary duplication of resources. (b) The factors for determining the public\nneed for MEV devices used in therapeutic radiology shall include, but not be\nlimited to, the following: (1)\n\nNo equipment\nother than four or more MEV or cobalt teletherapy units with a source axis\ndistance of 80 or more centimeters and rotational capabilities will be\nconsidered appropriate as the primary unit in a multi-unit radiotherapy service\nor as the sole unit in a smaller radiotherapeutic unit. (2)\n\nNinety-five percent of the total\npopulation of each health region is within a one-hour mean travel time, adjusted for weather conditions, of a facility providing therapeutic radiology\nservices. (3)\n\nThe expected volume\nof utilization sufficient to support the need for an MEV machine shall be\ncalculated as follows: (i) Each applicant and\nMEV machine shall provide a minimum of 5,000 treatments per year and have the\ncapacity to provide 6,500 treatments per year. These volumes may be adjusted\nfor the expected case-mix of a specific facility. (ii)\n\nSixty percent of the annual incidence of\ncancer cases in a service area will be candidates for radiation\ntherapy. (iii)\n\nFifty percent of\nradiation therapy patients will be treated for cure with an average course of\ntreatment of 35 treatments and 50 percent of patients will be treated for\npalliation with an average course of treatment of 15 treatments. These\nestimates may be adjusted based on the case-mix of a specific\nfacility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n709.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
