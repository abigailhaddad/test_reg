  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 125.2 - Payment of fine\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as provided in subdivisions (b) through (d) of this section, all fines\nare due and payable immediately. If the fine is not paid immediately, the\ndriver's license or operating privilege will be suspended, and the registration\nor privilege of operation may be suspended as provided by law, until full\npayment is made. (b) For good\ncause, the administrative law judge who adjudicates a summons or the senior\nadministrative law judge in charge, may grant an adjournment for payment of up\nto 30 days after entry of the determination. (c) In any case where an adjournment for\npayment has been granted pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, a senior\nadministrative law judge in charge may grant one additional adjournment for\npayment for not more than 60 days; provided, however, that where the total of\nall penalties payable by one motorist exceeds $1,000, such additional\nadjournment may be for a period of up to five months. (d) In determining whether there is good\ncause to grant an adjournment for payment, the administrative law judge or\nsenior administrative law judge shall consider the motorist's ability to pay\nthe fine immediately and whether there is a reasonable likelihood that payment\nwill be made within the extended time period. In any case in which the motorist\nis subject to penalties arising from two or more charges, the granting of an\nadjournment for payment on any particular charge may be conditioned on the\nimmediate payment of the penalty or penalties arising from one or more\ndifferent charges.
