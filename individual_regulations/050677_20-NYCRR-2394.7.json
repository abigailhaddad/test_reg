  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2394.7 - Conduct of a prompt hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The hearing shall be conducted by an impartial hearing officer who knows\nnothing of the controversy prior to the hearing, and who is authorized to: (1)\nadminister oaths and\naffirmations; (2)\nsign and issue\nsubpoenas as provided in section\n3000.6\n(c) of this Title; and\n(3)\nregulate the\ncourse of the hearings. (b) At the hearing, the parties may call and\nexamine witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross-examine opposing witnesses on any\nmatter relevant to the issues even though the matter was not covered in direct\nexamination, impeach any witness regardless of which party first called him to\ntestify, and rebut the evidence against them. A copy of a Federal determination\nrelating to the issues may be received in evidence to show such determination. Affidavits as to relevant facts may be received, for whatever value they may\nhave, in lieu of the oral testimony of the persons making such affidavits. Technical rules of evidence will be disregarded to the extent permitted by the\ndecisions of the courts of New York State, provided the evidence offered\nappears to be relevant and material to the issues. However, effect shall be\ngiven to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to evidentiary\noffers may be made and shall be noted in the record. The hearing officer may, where the record appears unclear, ask questions of the parties or of witnesses\nfor the purpose of clarifying the record to better enable the State Tax\n\nCommission to decide the issues. (c) Where books, records, papers or other\ndocuments have been received in evidence, the substitution of a copy thereof\nmay be permitted. Where original exhibits have been received in evidence, the\nparty which offered such exhibit may be permitted to withdraw it after the\ndecision of the State Tax Commission. (d) After the parties have completed the\nsubmission of the evidence, they may orally argue the applicability of the law\nto the facts. If the parties also wish to submit written legal memoranda, they\nmay do so within five business days of the close of the hearing. Each party\nshall serve a copy thereof on the other party. The legal memoranda shall be a\npart of the record of the hearing. The parties may also submit proposed\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law. (e) The record of the hearing will normally\nbe made by use of an electronic recording device. (f) In the event a party or his\nrepresentative does not appear at a scheduled hearing, without prior notice of\nhis inability to appear, the hearing officer shall recommend to the Tax\n\nCommission a default decision against that party. (g) Continued hearings shall be rescheduled\npromptly, but in all events within five business days from the last preceding\ndate on which the hearing was held. Any extension or waiver of this time\nlimitation shall only be at the request and with the consent of the applicant\nor his duly authorized representative. (h) The State Tax Commission will not require\nthe appearance of the parties or their duly authorized representatives for the\nsubmission of evidence where sufficient facts have been admitted, stipulated or\nincluded in the record in some other way, and the parties consent in writing to\nhave the controversy heard on submission without need for appearance of the\nparties at an oral hearing. The parties may submit written legal memoranda, additional documents or other material in support of their position to the Tax\n\nAppeals Bureau within five business days of the date fixed for the close of the\nsubmission of evidence by the Director of the Tax Appeals Bureau with the\nconsent of the applicant or his duly authorized representative. (i) All provisions of Parts 2390 and 3000 of\nthis Title shall apply insofar as they may be made applicable to the procedure\nprescribed by this Part; provided, however, any such provisions which would in\nany manner delay or deny to any applicant hereunder his right to a prompt\nhearing and decision on his application hereunder are inapplicable to the\nprocedures and proceedings provided for in this Part.
