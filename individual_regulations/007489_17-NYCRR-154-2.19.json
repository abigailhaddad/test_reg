(c) A leasing entity must have had its\nvehicles registered in New York prior to January 1, 1986 for F3, F4, F5 or F6\ncategory permits, or currently registered New York for F1 and F2 category\npermits in order to obtain a divisible load overweight permit for such\nvehicles. The vehicle must be registered in New York at the time of permit\napplication and for the duration of that permit.

(d) Immediate emergency leasing. An immediate\nemergency leasing occurs when leasing is required either to complete a\ndelivery(s) or to remove a vehicle from the highway for safety purposes. The\npermit will be automatically amended. (1)\n\nThe\nburden is on the owner/lessee to establish that an immediate emergency leasing\nsituation exists. (2)\n\nThe immediate\nemergency leasing will only be valid for two days. (3)\n\nPermit violations are borne by the\nlessee/owner. (4)\n\nThe lease must be\ncarried in the leased vehicle and be open to inspection upon request. (e) Short-term leasing. Short-term\nleasing covers circumstances in which the power unit, trailer, or single\nvehicle has been rendered inoperable for a short-term, requiring the owner to\nlease a replacement vehicle. A short-term leasing permit may be obtained if\nthere is no other available vehicle in the registered owner's possession. This\nleasing situation will apply only if the lessee requires short-term leasing to\nmeet contractual obligations. (1)\n\nShort-term\nleasing shall not exceed 30 days. (2)\n\nShort-term leasing of a power unit. The\nlessee must apply for an amendment to the leasing entity's permit. The leased\npower unit must have had a divisible load overweight permit in the name of the\nleasing entity. The permit amendment will identify the lessee as the operator. A copy of the lease must be submitted with the application. The lease or copy\nmust be carried in the power unit and be open to inspection upon request. (i) The fee for this amendment application is\n$100.

If the lessee has not\npreviously obtained an annual vehicle permit for the power unit which will be\noperated with the leased trailer, and/or the leased trailer weight and/or\ndimensions does not qualify for a previously obtained vehicle permit then the\nlessee must either obtain an annual vehicle permit or amend its permit, as the\ncase may be; otherwise, the lessee is limited to nonpermit legal weights under\nsection\n385\n(6)-(10)\nof the Vehicle and Traffic\n\nLaw.
