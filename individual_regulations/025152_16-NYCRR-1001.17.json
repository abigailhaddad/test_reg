  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.17 - Exhibit 17: air emissions\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf applicable, Exhibit 17 shall contain: (a) A demonstration of the facility's\ncompliance with applicable Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements\nregarding air emissions. (b) An\nassessment of existing ambient air quality levels and air quality trends for\npollutants in the region surrounding the facility, including air quality levels\nand trends taken from regional air quality summaries and air quality trend\nreports. (c) For emissions of the\nfollowing substances by combustion sources at the facility, a table indicating\nthe rate and amount of emissions with the name of the substance in the first\ncolumn, the hourly emission rate in the second column, and the annual potential\nto emit in the third column: (1)\nsulfur\ndioxide (SO\n2\n); (2)\noxides of nitrogen\n(NO\nx\n); (3)\ncarbon dioxide (CO\n2\n); (4)\ncarbon monoxide (CO); (5)\nparticulate matter\n(PM\n2.5, PM\n10, total\nPM); (6)\nvolatile organic compounds\n(VOCs); (7)\nelemental\nlead; (8)\nmercury; and\n(9)\na set of non-criteria (i.e. toxic)\npollutants to be emitted from the proposed facility as determined in\nconsultation with DOH and DEC. (d) An assessment of the potential impacts to\nambient air quality that may result from pollutant emissions from the facility, including: (1)\nan estimation of the maximum\npotential air concentrations (short-term and long-term) of appropriate\npollutants determined in consultation with DOH and DEC; (2)\na comparison of the maximum predicted air\nconcentrations to ambient air quality standards and guidelines and ambient\nbackground concentrations for non- criteria pollutants for both short-term and\nlong-term exposures for any appropriate pollutant determined in consultation\nwith DOH and DEC; (3)\nwhere\nwarranted as determined in consultation with DOH and DEC, cumulative source\nimpact analyses for any appropriate pollutant in accordance with air permitting\nrequirements and 6 NYCRR Part\n487; and\n(e) An offsite consequence analysis for any\nammonia that shall be stored onsite, including an analysis of an accidental\nrelease scenario for ammonia performed to meet the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulations implementing section 112(r) of\nthe Clean Air Act. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
