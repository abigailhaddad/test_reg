  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 269.3 - Certificate of nonresidence and apportionment of wages for services within and without the City of Yonkers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. An employer who is required to withhold City of Yonkers earnings tax\non nonresidents (see section\n269.1\nof this Part) must deduct and withhold such City of Yonkers earnings tax on\nnonresidents on all wages paid to an employee who is a nonresident of the City\nof Yonkers for all services performed in the City of Yonkers. Wages paid to a\nnonresident employee for personal services rendered entirely without the City\nof Yonkers are not subject to withholding of City of Yonkers earnings tax on\nnonresidents. (b) Certificate of\nnonresidence. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d) of this section, employees who are nonresidents of the City of Yonkers and perform any services\nwithin the City of Yonkers must file with such employee's employer a \"City of\n\nYonkers Certificate of Nonresidence,\" form IT-2104.5, and such employer must\nthen deduct and withhold City of Yonkers earnings tax on nonresidents based on\nthe information furnished in such certificate of nonresidence. (c) Content of certificate. An employee\nclaiming City of Yonkers nonresident status shall certify on a City of Yonkers\n\nCertificate of Nonresidence that such employee is not a resident of the City of\n\nYonkers, and, if an employee claiming City of Yonkers nonresident status earns\nwages for services performed partly within and partly without the City of\n\nYonkers, such employee shall indicate on such certificate of nonresidence a\nreasonable estimate of the portion of total wages to be earned during the\ntaxable year which represents compensation for services performed within the\n\nCity of Yonkers during such taxable year. The portion of wages allocated to\nservices performed within the City of Yonkers must be determined in accordance\nwith the provisions of section\n171.6\nof this Title. (d) Certificate of\nnonresidence not required. An employee (1) who is a nonresident of the City of\n\nYonkers, and (2) who performs services partly within and partly without the\n\nCity of Yonkers, other than the services described in section\n171.6\n(b)(2)(i)\nof this Title, and (3) whose total wages for the taxable year from services\nperformed within the City of Yonkers are not reasonably expected to exceed\n$3,000 (or $3,000 prorated for taxable periods of less than one year), and (4)\nwhose address, as provided by such employee on form IT-2104 (or on Federal form\nW-4 if such form IT-2104 has not been provided), indicates that such employee\nis presumably a nonresident of the City of Yonkers, shall not be required to\nfile a City of Yonkers Certificate of Nonresidence with such employee's\nemployer, and such employer need not deduct and withhold any amount of City of\n\nYonkers earnings tax on nonresidents from employee's wages. (e) The mere filing of a City of Yonkers\n\nCertificate of Nonresidence does not relieve the employer from the duty of\nwithholding the proper amount of City of Yonkers earnings tax on nonresidents\nfrom wages paid to a nonresident employee for services performed in the City of\n\nYonkers. The City of Yonkers Certificate of Nonresidence filed with an employer\nmust be retained by such employer and must be available for inspection by\nrepresentatives of the State Tax Commission.
