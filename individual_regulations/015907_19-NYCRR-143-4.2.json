  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 §§ 143-4.2 - Search requests\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The central\nfiling office will accept a UCC search request only if such request: (1)\nis in writing; (2)\nis communicated to the UCC unit of the\ncentral filing office by personal delivery, courier delivery, or postal service\ndelivery; (3)\nspecifies the name of\nthe debtor to be searched; (4)\nspecifies whether the debtor is an individual or an organization; (5)\nin the case of a search request that\nspecifies that the debtor is an individual, specifies the last name of such\nindividual (such a search request may also specify a first name or initial, a\nmiddle name or initial, and/or a suffix); (6)\nspecifies the name and address of the\nperson to whom the search report is to be sent; and\n(7)\nis accompanied by the appropriate fee, paid using a payment method authorized by section\n143-5.2\nof this Part. (b) The central filing office may\nrefuse to process a search request made on any form other than the approved\ninformation request form promulgated under section\n143-1.3\n(a)(9)\nof\nthis Part, or on a form determined by the central filing office to be\nsubstantially similar to such approved form. (c) Except as otherwise provided in section\n143-4.3\n(c)(9)\nof\nthis Subpart, a search request will be processed using the exact name of the\ndebtor as specified in the search request (as modified by the filing office by\napplication of the rules set forth in section\n143-4.3\nof this\n\nSubpart). (d) A search request may\ncontain only one name to be searched. However, a search request that is made by\nchecking the box in item 7 of the financing statement form promulgated under\nsection\n143-1.3\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part may request a search against any one or more of the debtors named in\nsuch financing statement. The filing office may refuse to process a search\nrequest that is made in such financing statement form if such financing\nstatement is not accepted for filing. (e) A search request may limit the records\nrequested by limiting them by the city (or city and state) of the debtor. The\nrequest may limit the records requested to notices of liens for taxes payable\nto the United States of America, and certificates and notices affecting such\nliens, only. A report created by the filing office in response to a request\nwith either such limitation may contain a statement substantially similar to\nthe following: \"A limited search may not reveal all filings against the debtor\nsearched and the requesting party bears the risk of relying on such a search.\"\nIf the information request form promulgated under section\n143-1.3\n(a)(9)\nof\nthis Part is used to make such a limited search request, the request to limit\nthe search and the parameters of the limitation (i.e., the city [or city and\nstate] to be searched, or an indication that the search request is for notices\nof liens for taxes payable to the United States of America, and certificates\nand notices affecting such liens, only) should be stated in item 3 of that\nform. (f) A search request may\ninclude instructions on the mode of delivery desired, if other than by ordinary\nmail. Such delivery instruction will be honored, provided that: (1)\nthe requested mode of delivery is then\nmade available by the filing office; and\n(2)\nany additional cost associated with such\ndelivery is paid for by the requestor in advance. If the information request\nform promulgated under section\n143-1.3\n(a)(9)\nof\nthis Part is used, instructions on the mode of delivery should be stated in\nitem 4 of that form. (g) A search request may request that the search results reflect: (1)\nunlapsed filings only; or\n(2)\nall filings as to which a record is still\nmaintained by the filing office under section 9-522(a) of the UCC on the\ncertification date. A search request that does not specify if it is requesting\nunlapsed filings only or all filings will be processed as a request for\nunlapsed filings only. (h) A single request form may not be used to\nrequest both a search and copies from the central filing office. If a single\nform requesting both a search and copies is submitted to the central filing\noffice, the central filing office will process the search request and will not\nprocess the copy request. To request copies from the central filing office, a\nseparate request must be submitted. A request for copies must be accompanied by\nthe appropriate fee for such copies. (i) The person requesting a search from the\ncentral filing office may request that the search results be issued under seal. If the information request form promulgated under section\n143-1.3\n(a)(9)\nof\nthis Part is used to make the search request, the request to issue the results\nunder seal should be set forth in item 3 of that form. Checking the \"certified\"\nbox in item 2a of that form will not be treated as a request that the search\nresults be issued under seal. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§§\n143-4.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
