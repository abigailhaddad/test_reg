(See section\n1516[b][1] of the Tax Law\nfor an amount deemed to be a properly estimated tax payment.) Failure to meet\nany of the requirements in this subdivision makes the application invalid and\nany return filed after the due date will be treated as a late filed\nreturn. (b) An automatic six-month\nextension of time for filing a combined return will be granted to a group of\ncorporations authorized to file a combined return provided the application for\nautomatic extension (form CT-5) is filed and a properly estimated tax is paid\non or before the due date of the return for the taxable period for which the\nextension is requested. (See section\n1516[b][1] of the Tax Law\nfor an amount deemed to be a properly estimated tax payment.) Failure to meet\nany of the requirements in this subdivision makes the application invalid and\nany return filed after the due date will be treated as a late filed return. To\nobtain an automatic extension, an application must be filed by the corporation\npaying the tax for the combined group. The applicant must submit the following\ninformation: (1)\nits complete corporate\nname; (2)\nits employer\nidentification number; (3)\nits file\nclassification number; (4)\na list\nshowing the corporate name, employer identification number, file classification\nnumber and taxable period of each of the other corporations properly included\nas part of the combined group; and\n(5)\na list showing the estimated tax for each\ntaxpayer included as part of the combined group. The corporation paying the tax\nfor the combined group must pay with the application the properly estimated\ncombined tax plus the minimum tax for each of the other taxpayers included in\nthe combined group. (c) On or before the expiration of the automatic six-month extension of time for\nfiling a return, the Tax Commission may grant additional three-month extensions\nof time for filing a return when good cause exists. No more than two additional\nthree-month extensions of time for filing a return for any taxable year may be\ngranted. An application for each additional three- month extension must be made\nin writing before the expiration of the previous extension.

(d) Any extension of time for\nfiling a return granted under this section will not extend the time for the\npayment of any tax due. (However, see section\n2392.1\nof this\n\nTitle for provisions relating to the existence of reasonable cause for purposes\nof not imposing the addition to tax for failure to pay the amount of tax shown\non a return where there are valid extensions of time to file.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
