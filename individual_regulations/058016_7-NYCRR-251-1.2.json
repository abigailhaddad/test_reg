  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 §§ 251-1.2 - Use of physical force\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The greatest caution and conservative judgment shall be applied in determining: (1)\nwhether physical force is necessary; and\n(2)\nthe degree of such force\nthat is necessary. Each employee is personally charged under law and the\npolicies of the department with responsibility for acting in good faith, with\nreasonable care and upon probable cause. (b) Where it is necessary to use physical\nforce, only such degree of force as is reasonably required shall be\nused. (c) Unless there is an\nimmediate danger to safety, security or property, an employee shall notify the\nsuperintendent of any situation where the use of physical force may be or\nbecome necessary and shall not attempt to use physical force except in\naccordance with instructions received from the person designated by the\nsuperintendent to take charge of such situation. (d) An employee shall not lay hands on or\nstrike an inmate unless the employee reasonably believes that the physical\nforce to be used is reasonably necessary: for self-defense; to prevent injury\nto person or property; to enforce compliance with a lawful direction; to quell\na disturbance; or to prevent an escape. (e) An employee may use a weapon, other than\na firearm (e.g., a baton or chemical agent) only when and to the extent that\nthe employee reasonably believes such use is necessary: for self-defense; to\nprevent a serious assault or gross destruction of property; to quell a\ndisturbance; or, to prevent an escape. Where it is necessary to use such a\nweapon, the employee should take due care to avoid, to the best of his ability\nin the circumstances, the infliction of serious physical injury. (f) (1)\n\nFirearms and deadly physical force shall not be used except as a last resort, and then only in situations where the employee reasonably believes that deadly\nphysical force is necessary: (i) to defend\nhimself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the unlawful\nuse or immediate danger of unlawful use of the kind of physical force that is\nreadily capable of causing death or other serious physical injury; (ii)\nto prevent or terminate what he\nreasonably believes to be the commission or attempted commission of arson; or\n(iii)\nto prevent the escape of\nan inmate from the correctional facility or from custody while in transit\nthereto or therefrom. (2)\n\nWhere it is necessary to use a firearm, the weapon shall, whenever possible, be used to disable rather than to kill. Before aiming a firearm at any person an employee shall, whenever possible, give due warning, orally, or by firing a shot into the air or in some other\nreadily understandable manner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§§\n251-1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
