  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4012.5 - Out-of-competition testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Out-of-competition testing authorized. The commission may at a reasonable time\non any date take blood, urine or other biologic samples (e.g., hair) from a\nhorse to enhance the ability of the commission to enforce the commission's\nequine drug and anti-doping rules (e.g., the prohibitions of section\n4043.12\nof this Article). The\ncommission shall own such samples. This rule authorizes only the collection and\ntesting of samples and does not independently make impermissible the\nadministration to or presence in any horse of any drug or other substance. A\nrace-day prohibition or restriction of a substance by a commission rule is not\napplicable to an out-of-competition test unless there is an attempt to race the\nhorse in a manner that violates such rule. (b) Horses eligible to be tested. Any horse\nthat has been engaging in activities related to competing in pari-mutuel horse\nracing in New York may be tested. This includes without limitation any horses\nthat are training outside the jurisdiction to participate in racing in New York\nand all horses that are training in New York, but excludes weanlings, yearlings\nand horses no longer engaged in horse racing (e.g., retired broodmares). (1)\nA horse is presumed eligible for\nout-of-competition testing if such horse: (i) is on the grounds at a racetrack or training center under the jurisdiction of\nthe commission; (ii)\nis under the\ncare or control of a trainer licensed by the commission; (iii)\nis owned by an owner licensed by the\ncommission; (iv)\nis entered or\nnominated to race at a premises licensed by the commission; (v) has raced within the previous 12 months\nat a premises licensed by the commission; or\n(vi)\nis nominated to a program based on\nracing in New York, including without limitation breeders' awards, the\nthoroughbred breeding and development fund and thoroughbred stakes\nraces. (2)\n\nSuch\npresumptions are conclusive in the absence of evidence that a horse is not\nengaged in activities related to competing in horse racing in New York\n\nState. (c) Selection of\nhorses to be tested. (1)\n\nHorses shall be\nselected for sampling by a commission veterinarian, executive director, director of horse racing and pari-mutuel wagering, equine medical director or\nsteward, or a designee of any of the foregoing. (2)\n\nHorses may be selected to be tested at\nrandom, for cause or as otherwise determined in the discretion of the\ncommission. (3)\n\nCollectors shall\nfor suspicionless collections of samples abide by a plan that has been approved\nby a supervisor not in the field and that identifies specific horses or\nprovides neutral and objective criteria to follow in the field to determine\nwhich horses to sample. Such a supervisor may consider input from persons in\nthe field during the operation of the plan and select additional horses to be\nsampled. (d) Cooperation\nwith the commission\n(1)\n\nLicensees of the\ncommission are required to cooperate and comply fully with the provisions of\nthis rule. (2)\n\nPersons who apply\nfor and are granted a trainer or owner license shall be deemed to have given\ntheir consent for access at such premises as their horse may be found for the\npurpose of commission representatives collecting out-of-competition samples. Licensees shall take any steps necessary to authorize access by commission\nrepresentatives at such premises. (3)\n\nNo other person shall knowingly interfere\nwith or obstruct a sampling. (e) General procedure for collecting samples. (1)\n\nSamples shall be taken under the\nsupervision and direction of a person who is employed or designated by the\ncommission. All blood samples shall be collected by a veterinarian licensed in\nthe jurisdiction where the sample is collected or by a veterinary technician\nwho is acting under appropriate supervision of the veterinarian. (2)\n\nUpon request of a representative of the\ncommission, the trainer, owner or the specified designee of the trainer or\nowner shall provide the location of their horses eligible for\nout-of-competition testing. (3)\n\nThe\ncommission need not provide advance notice before arriving at any location to\ncollect samples, whether such location is controlled by a commission licensee\nor not. (4)\n\nThe trainer, owner or\nthe specified designee of the trainer or owner shall cooperate with the person\nwho takes samples for the commission, which cooperation shall include, without\nlimitation: (i) assisting in the immediate\nlocation and identification of the horse; (ii)\nmaking the horse available as soon as\npractical upon arrival of the person who is responsible for collecting the\nsamples; (iii)\nproviding a stall or\nother safe location to collect the samples; (iv)\nassisting the person who is collecting\nsamples in properly procuring the samples; and\n(v) witnessing the taking of samples, including sealing of sample collection containers. (5)\n\nThe management and employees of a\nlicensed racetrack or training facility at which a horse may be located shall\ncooperate fully with a person who is authorized to take samples. The person who\ncollects samples for the commission may require that the collection be done at\na specified location on such premises. (6)\n\nThe commission, if requested and in its\nsole discretion, may permit the trainer, owner or the specified designee of the\ntrainer or owner to present a horse that is located in New York State, but not\nat a racetrack or training center licensed by the commission, to be sampled at\na time and location designated by the commission. (f) Procedure for collecting samples from\nhorses located outside New York State. (1)\n\nThe commission may arrange for the sampling of an out-of-state horse by the\nracing commission or other designated person in the jurisdiction where the\nhorse is located. Such racing commission or other designated person shall\nfollow the relevant provisions of this rule, including paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (e) of this section. (2)\n\nThe test results shall be made available\nfor regulatory use to each jurisdiction that has participated in the process of\ncollecting any out-of-competition sample, subject to any restrictions on public\ndisclosure of test results that apply to the commission that selected the horse\nfor sampling. (3)\n\nThe commission, if requested and in its sole discretion, may permit the trainer or owner\ninstead to transport the horse into New York State for sampling at a time and\nplace designated by the commission. (g) Additional procedures. (1)\n\nThe person who takes samples for the\ncommission shall provide identification and disclose the purpose of the\nsampling to the trainer or designated attendant of the horse. (2)\nA written protocol for the collection of\nsamples shall be made generally available. (3)\n\nAn owner or trainer does not consent to a\nsearch of the premises by making a horse that is not located at a licensed\nracetrack available for sampling. (4)\n\nIf the trainer or other custodian of a\nselected horse refuses or declines to make the horse available for sampling and\nthe managing owner has previously provided the commission with a means for the\ncommission to give immediate notification to the managing owner in such\nsituation, then the commission shall attempt to notify the managing owner and\nthe eligibility of the horse shall be preserved if the managing owner is able\nto make the horse available for immediate sampling. The commission is not\nrequired to make repeated attempts to notify the managing owner. (5)\n\nThe chain-of-custody record for the\nsample shall be maintained and made available to the trainer, owner or the\ndesignee of the trainer or owner when an adjudicatory proceeding results from\nan out-of-competition test. (h) Analysis of collected samples. (1)\n\nThe commission may have\nout-of-competition samples tested to produce information that may enhance the\nability of the commission to enforce the commission's equine drug and\nanti-doping rules. (2)\n\nThe rules\nand procedures for post-race testing shall apply to out-of-competition\ntesting. (3)\n\nThe commission may use\nany remaining sample for research and investigation. (i) Penalties for non-cooperation. (1)\n\nWillful failure to make a horse available for sampling or other willfully\ndeceptive acts or interference in the sampling process shall carry a minimum\npenalty of a one-year license suspension and be referred to the commission for\nfurther action. (2)\nA selected horse that is\nnot made available for out-of-competition sampling shall be placed on the\n\nSteward's List. The horse shall remain on the Steward's List for a minimum of\n180 days unless the owner can establish extraordinary mitigating\ncircumstances. (3)\nA selected horse\nthat is presumed eligible for out-of-competition testing shall be placed on the\n\nSteward's list and be ineligible to race in New York State for 180 days if the\nhorse is not sampled upon the trainer, owner or the designee of the trainer or\nowner asserting that the horse is not engaged in activities related to\ncompeting in horse racing in New York State. This restriction shall not apply\nif the trainer, owner or the designee of the trainer or owner instead permits\nvoluntarily an immediate collection of such samples from the horse, which shall\nnot constitute a waiver of asserting that the commission lacks jurisdiction\nover the horse.
