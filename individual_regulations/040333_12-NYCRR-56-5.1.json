  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-5.1 - Asbestos survey requirements for building/structure demolition, renovation, remodeling and repair\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Asbestos survey required. An owner or an owner's agent, except the owner of one\nand two-family dwellings who contracts for, but does not direct or control the\nwork, shall cause to be conducted, an asbestos survey completed by a licensed\nasbestos contractor using inspectors certified in compliance with section\n56-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nPart, to determine whether or not the building or structure, or portion(s)\nthereof to be demolished, renovated, remodeled, or have repair work, contains\nACM, PACM or asbestos material. This asbestos survey shall be completed and\nsubmitted as indicated in subdivision (g) of this section, prior to commencing\nwork. All such asbestos surveys shall be conducted in conformance with the\nrequirements of subdivision (e) of this section. (b) Exemptions to asbestos survey\nrequirements. The asbestos survey required by this subdivision (a) of this\nsection shall not be required for the following classes of buildings or\nstructures: (1)\nan agricultural\nbuilding; (2)\nbuildings or\nstructures for which original construction commenced on or after January 1, 1974; (3)\na structure certified in\nwriting to be structurally unsound by a licensed professional engineer, registered architect, building inspector, fire inspector or other official of\ncompetent jurisdiction. (See section\n56-11.5\nof this Part.)\n(c) Building/structure demolition. If a building/structure asbestos survey is not required or performed per\nsubdivision (b) of this section, and the building/structure is certified to be\nunsound or slated for contracted demolition, the building/structure shall be\nassumed to contain asbestos, and shall be demolished per this Part, unless the\nbuilding/structure is adequately certified to be free of asbestos containing\nmaterial. Acceptable documentation for certification shall be a previous\nthorough building/structure asbestos survey, abatement records or other\ndocumentation acceptable to the commissioner or his or her\nrepresentative. (d) Responsibility\nto comply. No exemption to the requirement to conduct an asbestos survey shall\nexempt any person, asbestos contractor, property owner or business entity from\nthe inspection or asbestos survey requirements of EPA, OSHA, and any other\napplicable section of this Part. (e) Building/structure asbestos survey\nrequirements. The asbestos survey shall include a thorough inspection for and\nidentification of all PACM, suspect miscellaneous ACM, or asbestos material\nthroughout the building/structure or portion thereof to be demolished, renovated, remodeled, or to have repair work. The required inspection shall be\nperformed by a certified asbestos inspector, and, at a minimum, shall include\nidentification of PACM, suspect miscellaneous ACM or asbestos material by all\nof the following methods: (1)\nthe review of\nbuilding/structure plans and records, if available, for references to asbestos, ACM, PACM, suspect miscellaneous ACM or asbestos material used in construction, renovation or repair; and\n(2)\na\nvisual inspection for PACM and suspect miscellaneous ACM throughout the\nbuilding/structure or portion thereof to be demolished, renovated, remodeled, or repaired. For the purpose of this Part, all PACM and suspect miscellaneous\nACM visually assessed shall be treated and handled as ACM and shall be assumed\nto be ACM, unless bulk sampling is conducted as per this section, standard EPA\nand OSHA accepted methods, including multi- layered systems sampling protocols; the subsequent analyses are performed by a laboratory that meets the\nrequirements of section\n56-4.2\nof this Part; and the\nanalyses satisfies both ELAP and Federal requirements, including multi-layered\nsample analyses, to document non-asbestos containing material. (f) Building/structure asbestos\nsurvey information. (1)\n\nThe asbestos survey\nshall, at a minimum, identify and assess with due diligence, the locations, quantities, friability and conditions of all types of installations at the\naffected portion of the building/structure relative to the ACM, suspect\nmiscellaneous ACM, PACM or asbestos material contained therein. The following\nlist is not inclusive of all types of ACMs, it only summarizes typical ACMs. The certified asbestos inspector is responsible for identification and\nassessment of all types ACM, PACM, suspect miscellaneous ACM and asbestos\nmaterial within the affected portion of the building/structure: (i) PACM\n(a) Surfacing treatments: (1)\nfireproofing; (2)\nacoustical plaster; (3)\nfinish plasters; and\n(4)\nskim coats of joint compound.

(b) Other miscellaneous materials: (1)\ndust and debris; (2)\nfloor tile; (3)\ncove base; (4)\nfloor leveler compound; (5)\nceiling tile; (6)\nvermiculite insulationl\n(7)\ngaskets, seals, sealants (including for\ncondensate control); (8)\nvibration\nisolators; (9)\nlaboratory tables\nand hoods; (10)\nchalkboards; (11)\npipe penetration\npacking or other firestopping materials; (12)\ncementitious pipe (transite); (13)\ncementitious board (transite); (14)\nelectrical wire insulation; (15)\nfire curtains; (16)\nfire blankets; (17)\nfire doors; (18)\nbrakes and clutches; (19)\nmastics, adhesives and glues; (20)\ncaulks; (21)\nsheet flooring (linoleum); (22)\nwallpaper; (23)\ndrywall; (24)\nplasterboard; (25)\nspackling/joint compound; (26)\ntextured paint; (27)\ngrout; (28)\nglazing compound; (29)\nterrazzo; and\n(30)\nboiler rope. (2)\n\nAll ACM, PACM, suspect miscellaneous ACM, or asbestos material reported under paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision shall include the location of the materials, an estimate of\nthe quantities, types, friability and condition of the identified materials to\nbe treated and handled as ACM. For the purpose of this Part, all PACM and\nsuspect miscellaneous ACM visually assessed shall be treated and handled as ACM\nand shall be assumed to be ACM, unless bulk sampling is conducted as per this\nsection, standard EPA and OSHA accepted methods, including multi-layered\nsystems sampling protocols; the subsequent analyses are performed by a\nlaboratory that meets the requirements of section\n56-4.2\nof this Part; and the\nanalyses satisfies both ELAP and Federal requirements, including multi-layered\nsample analyses, to document non-asbestos containing material. (3)\n\nThe building/structure asbestos survey\nshall also include the building/structure name, address, the building/structure\nowner's name and address, the name and address of the owner's agent, the name\nof the firm performing the asbestos survey and a copy of the firm's current\nasbestos handling license, the names of the certified inspector(s) performing\nthe survey and a copy of the current asbestos handling certificate for each\ninspector utilized, the dates of the asbestos survey, a listing of homogeneous\nareas identifying which ones are ACM, all laboratory analyses reports for bulk\nsamples collected, and copies of the appropriate certifications for the\nlaboratory used for analysis of samples taken during the asbestos\nsurvey. (g) Transmittal\nof building/structure asbestos survey information. One copy of the results of\nthe building/structure asbestos survey shall be immediately transmitted by the\nbuilding/ structure owner as follows: (1)\n\nOne\ncopy of the completed asbestos survey shall be sent by the owner or their agent\nto the local government entity charged with issuing a permit for such\ndemolition, renovation, remodeling or repair work under applicable State or\nlocal laws. (2)\n\nThe completed\nasbestos survey for controlled demolition (as per section 56- 11.5 of this\n\nPart) or pre-demolition asbestos projects shall also be submitted to the\n\nAsbestos Control Bureau district office that is closest to the building or\nstructure location. (3)\n\nThe\ncompleted asbestos survey shall be kept on the construction site with the\nasbestos notification and variance, if required, throughout the duration of the\nasbestos project and any associated demolition, renovation, remodeling or\nrepair project. (h) Removal required. If the building/structure asbestos survey finds that the\nportion of the building/structure to be demolished, renovated, remodeled, or\nhave repair work contains ACM, PACM, suspect miscellaneous ACM assumed to be\nACM, or asbestos material, which is impacted by the work, the owner or the\nowner's agent shall conduct, or cause to have conducted, asbestos removal\nperformed by a licensed asbestos abatement contractor in conformance with all\nstandards set forth in this Part. All ACM, PACM, suspect miscellaneous ACM\nassumed to be ACM, or asbestos material impacted by the demolition, renovation, remodeling or repair project shall be removed as per this Part, prior to access\nor disturbance by other uncertified trades or personnel. No demolition, renovation, remodeling or repair work shall be commenced by any owner or the\nowner's agent prior to the completion of the asbestos abatement in accordance\nwith the notification requirements of this Part. For multi-phased work, the\naccess restriction for uncertified trades or personnel applies to each\nintermediate portion of the entire project. Upon completion of the intermediate\nportion of the asbestos project, other trades or personnel may access that\nportion of the work site. For demolition projects that are exempt from asbestos\nsurvey requirements due to being structurally unsound, the demolition is\nconsidered an asbestos project and shall proceed as per section\n56-11.5\nof this Part. (1)\n\nAll building/structure owners and\nasbestos abatement contractors on a demolition, renovation, remodeling, or\nrepair project, which includes work covered by this Part, shall inform all\ntrades on the work site about PACM, ACM, asbestos material and suspect\nmiscellaneous ACM assumed to be ACM at the work site. (i) Bidding. Bids may be advertised and\ncontracts awarded for demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair work, but\nno work on the current intermediate portion of the project shall commence on\nthe demolition, renovation, remodeling or repair work by any owner or agent\nprior to completion of all necessary asbestos abatement work for the current\nintermediate portion of the entire project, in conformance with all standards\nset forth in this Part. (j) Unidentified and unassessed asbestos. When any construction activity, such as\ndemolition, remodeling, renovation or repair work, reveals PACM or suspect\nmiscellaneous ACM that has not been identified by the asbestos survey per this\n\nPart, or has not been identified by other inspections as per current OSHA or\nEPA requirements, all activities shall cease in the area where the PACM or\nsuspect miscellaneous ACM is found and the Asbestos Control Bureau shall be\nnotified by telephone by the building/structure owner or their representative, followed with a written notice in accordance with the notification requirements\nof this Part. Unassessed PACM or suspect miscellaneous ACM shall be treated and\nhandled as ACM and assumed to be ACM, unless proven otherwise by standard EPA\nand OSHA accepted methods, including multi-layered systems sampling protocols; subsequent analyses performed by a laboratory that meets the requirements of\nsection\n56-4.2\nof this Part; and the\nanalyses satisfies both NYS ELAP and Federal requirements, including\nmulti-layered sample analyses, to document non-asbestos containing\nmaterial.
