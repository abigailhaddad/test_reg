(iv)\n\nOdor. Not to exceed a threshold number\nof 250. (v) BOD. In zones 2, 3, 4\nand 5, a waste shall receive not less than zone percent reduction in addition\nto meeting allocation requirements. Footnotes\n* Persistent pesticides are defined as natural and\nsynthetic materials having a half-life of greater than 96 hours, which are used\nto control unwanted or noxious animals or plants. They include fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, fumigants and rodenticides. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
