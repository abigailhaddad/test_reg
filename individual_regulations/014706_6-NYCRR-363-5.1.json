  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-5.1 - Siting requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the requirements of section\n360.8\nof this Title, the following\nsiting requirements apply to all new landfills and expansions of existing\nlandfills regulated under this Part: (a) Bedrock and Unconsolidated Deposits\n(1)\n\nBedrock underlying the site must not be\nsubject to rapid or unpredictable groundwater flow, unless it can be\ndemonstrated to the department that a containment failure of the landfill would\nnot result in contamination entering the bedrock system. (2)\n\nUnconsolidated Deposits: A minimum of ten\nfeet of unconsolidated deposits must exist beneath the proposed landfill site\nto minimize the migration of contaminants from the facility. (i) At new landfill sites, these deposits\nmust consist of low permeability soils with silty and clayey characteristics\nand with the ability to attenuate and absorb contaminants. Large-scale, permeable deposits, which could result in migration of contaminants off-site\nprior to detection and/or remediation, must not be present. (ii)\n\nAt existing landfill sites active on or\nafter November 4, 1992 operating under and in compliance with a current permit\nor order on consent, there are no soil type restrictions provided the applicant\ndemonstrates that the expansion site will have no significant adverse impact on\ngroundwater. (b) The site must not be in proximity to any\nexisting mines, caves or other anomalous features that may alter groundwater\nflow, unless it can be demonstrated to the department that a containment\nfailure of the landfill would not result in contamination entering the\nfeatures. (c) Agricultural land. (1)\nA new landfill or a lateral expansion of\nan existing landfill may not be located on property which: (i) is taken through the exercise of eminent\ndomain; (ii)\nconsists of more than\n50 percent of agricultural soil group 1 or 2 (Land Classification System as\ncertified by the New York State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets); and\n(iii)\nis within an agricultural\ndistrict formed pursuant to the Agriculture and Markets Law, article 25-AA, sections 303 and 304. (2)\nA new landfill or a lateral expansion of\nan existing landfill within an agricultural district may not be sited within an\nagricultural district unless compliance with the requirements of article 25-AA, section\n305\nof the Agriculture and Markets Law has been demonstrated. (d) Primary water supply aquifers, principal\naquifers, and public water supplies. (1)\n\nNo\nnew landfill or lateral or vertical expansion of an existing landfill may be\nconstructed over primary water supply aquifers, principal aquifers, within a\npublic water supply stabilized cone of depression area, or within a minimum\ndistance of 500 feet to surface waters that are actively used as sources of\nmunicipal drinking water supply. In Nassau and Suffolk County, no person may\nconstruct or operate a new landfill or an expansion of an existing landfill, unless the department has made an affirmative determination that it will not\npose a threat to groundwater quality. (2)\n\nThe required horizontal separation\nbetween deposited waste and primary water supply aquifers, principal aquifers, capture zones of public water supply stabilized cone of depression areas or\nsurface waters that are actively used as sources of municipal drinking water\nsupply must be sufficient to preclude contravention of groundwater standards in\nthe aquifer and surface water standards in waters that are currently used as a\nsource of municipal drinking water supply. In Nassau or Suffolk County, no\nperson may construct or operate a new landfill or an expansion of an existing\nlandfill, unless the department has made an affirmative determination that it\nwill not pose a threat to groundwater quality. (e) Aircraft safety. (1)\nA landfill into which putrescible waste\nis to be disposed must not be sited closer than 10,000 feet from any area of an\nairport used or intended to be used for landing, taking off, or surface\nmaneuvering of turbine-powered fixed-wing aircraft or 5,000 feet from any area\nof an airport used or intended to be used for landing, taking off, or surface\nmaneuvering of piston-powered fixed-wing aircraft. (2)\nA landfill into which putrescible waste\nis to be disposed which is located within five miles of any area of an airport\nused or intended to be used for landing, taking off, or surface maneuvering of\naircraft must not, as determined by the Federal Aviation Administration, pose a\npotential bird or obstruction hazard to aircraft. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator of an existing\nlandfill that is authorized to dispose of putrescible waste and that is located\nless than 10,000 feet from any area of an airport used or intended to be used\nfor landing, taking off, or surface maneuvering of turbine-powered fixed-wing\naircraft or less than 5,000 feet from any area of an airport used or intended\nto be used for landing, taking off, or surface maneuvering of only\npiston-powered fixed-wing aircraft must provide in its permit renewal\napplication documentation that the Federal Aviation Administration has\ndetermined that the facility does not pose a bird hazard to aircraft. (4)\nA landfill containing only\nnonputrescible waste may be located less than 10,000 feet from any area of an\nairport used or intended to be used for landing, taking off, or surface\nmaneuvering of turbine-powered fixed-wing aircraft or less than 5,000 feet from\nany area of an airport used or intended to be used for landing, taking off, or\nsurface maneuvering of only piston-powered fixed-wing aircraft, if the Federal\n\nAviation Administration has determined that the landfill will not present a\nsafety hazard to air traffic. (5)\n\nThe final elevation of a new landfill or expansion of an existing landfill must\nnot extend more than 200 feet above the highest elevation of the land surface\nthat existed prior to landfill development, unless the Federal Aviation\n\nAdministration determines that the proposed fill height in excess of 200 feet\nwill not present a safety hazard to air traffic. (f) Unstable areas. New landfills or\nexpansions of existing landfills must not be located in unstable areas that are\nsusceptible to natural or human-induced events or forces capable of impairing\nthe integrity of some or all of the landfill structural components designed to\nprevent releases from the landfill. These may include: (1)\nareas having an active or substantial\nprobability of mass movement where the movement of earth material at, beneath, or adjacent to the landfill may result in downslope transport of soil or rock\nby means of gravitational influence. Areas of mass movement include, but are\nnot limited to, landslides, avalanches, debris slides or flows, soil\nfluctuations, block sliding and rockfall; and\n(2)\nareas where karst topography, with its\ncharacteristic surface and subterranean features, has developed as a result of\ndissolution of limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock. Characteristic\nphysiographic features present in karst terrain include, but are not limited\nto, sinkholes, sinking streams, caves, large springs, and blind valleys. (g) Unmonitorable or\nunremediable areas. New landfills must be located at sites that will allow\nenvironmental monitoring and site remediation to be conducted before off-site\nimpacts occur. (1)\n\nIdentification of these\nsites must be based upon the ability to: (i) sufficiently characterize groundwater and surface water flow to determine\nupgradient and downgradient directions; (ii)\ninstall environmental monitoring points\nthat will detect releases from the entire landfill; (iii)\ncharacterize and define a release from\nthe landfill; and\n(iv)\ndetermine\nwhat corrective actions may be necessary to respond to a contaminant release, and carry out those corrective actions. (2)\n\nLateral expansions of existing landfills\nthat are already contaminating groundwater may be allowed by the department if\nthe proposed area can be constructed in compliance with the regulations. This\nmay be demonstrated using remedial actions at the existing site resulting in a\ndemonstrated improvement in groundwater quality, and any additional monitoring\nrequirements needed to demonstrate the integrity of the expansion area such as\nleak detection lysimeters installed beneath the liner, statistical triggers of\ngroundwater monitoring, tracers, additional monitoring wells surrounding the\nsite, and any other monitoring methods required by the department. (h) Fault areas. New landfills and\nlateral expansions of existing landfills must not be located within 200 feet of\na fault that has had displacement in Holocene time unless the owner or operator\ndemonstrates to the department that an alternative setback distance of less\nthan 200 feet will not result in damage to the structural integrity of the\nlandfill and will be protective of public health and the environment. (i) Seismic impact zones. New landfills and\nlateral expansions of existing landfills must not be located in seismic impact\nzones, unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the department that\nlong-term containment structures, including liners, leachate collection and\nremoval system, leachate storage system, and surface water control system, are\ndesigned pursuant to the requirements of subdivision\n363-4.3\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (j) Wetlands\n\nNew landfills and lateral expansions of existing\nlandfills must not be located within the boundary of either state or\nfederally-regulated wetlands, unless the required permits are obtained from the\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or the department, and unless the owner or\noperator can demonstrate the following to the satisfaction of the\ndepartment. (1)\n\nNo practicable\nalternative to the proposed landfill is available which does not involve state\nor federally-regulated wetlands. (2)\n\nThe construction and operation of the landfill will not: (i) cause or contribute to violations of any\napplicable water quality standard; (ii)\nviolate any applicable toxic effluent\nstandard or prohibition; (iii)\njeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened\nspecies; (iv)\nresult in the\ndestruction or adverse modification of a critical habitat of any endangered or\nthreatened species; and\n(v) violate\nany requirement for the protection of a marine sanctuary under the Marine\n\nProtection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as incorporated by reference\nin section\n360.3\nof this\n\nTitle. (3)\n\nThe landfill\nwill not cause or contribute to significant degradation of federally-regulated\nwetlands. The owner or operator must demonstrate the integrity of the landfill\nand its ability to protect ecological resources by addressing the following\nfactors: (i) erosion, stability and migration\npotential of native wetland soils, muds, and deposits used to support the\nlandfill; (ii)\nerosion, stability\nand migration potential of dredged and fill materials used to support the\nlandfill; (iii)\nthe volume and\nchemical nature of the waste managed in the landfill; (iv)\npotential impacts from the release of\nthe solid waste on fish, wildlife, and other aquatic resources and their\nhabitat; (v) potential effects of a\ncatastrophic release of waste to the federally-regulated wetland and the\nresulting potential impacts on the environment; and\n(vi)\nany additional factors, as necessary, to\ndemonstrate that ecological resources in the federally-regulated wetland are\nsufficiently protected. (4)\n\nSteps have been taken to attempt to\nachieve no net loss of federally-regulated wetlands to the extent required\nunder federal or state law (as defined by acreage and function) by: (i) first avoiding impacts to\nfederally-regulated wetlands to the maximum extent practicable; then\n(ii)\nminimizing unavoidable impacts to the\nmaximum extent practicable; and then\n(iii)\nby offsetting remaining unavoidable\nwetland impacts through all appropriate and practicable compensatory mitigation\nactions (e.g., restoration of existing degraded wetlands or creation of new\nwetlands). (5)\n\nSufficient\ninformation is available to make a reasonable determination with respect to\nthese demonstrations. (k) School and residence. Excluded from the below requirements are residences and\nschools that are owned by or which have entered into legal agreement with the\nlandfill owner or operator. In terms of residences, the 1,000 feet distance in\nthe below requirements is measured from the closest location on the landfill\nproperty where waste will be placed to the residence building and managed\nlandscape. In terms of schools, the 1,000 feet distance in the below\nrequirements is measured from the closest location on the landfill property\nwhere waste will be placed to the school building and associated outdoor\nrecreation areas. (1)\nA new landfill, which submits an initial permit application after the effective date of this\nrulemaking, cannot be located within 1,000 feet of a school or residence. Schools or residences constructed after an initial Part 360 permit for a\nlandfill has been deemed complete by the department are excluded from this\nrequirement. (2)\nA lateral or\nvertical expansion of a landfill is prohibited within 1,000 feet of a school or\nresidence. Schools or residences constructed within 1,000 feet of a proposed\nexpanded footprint of a landfill after a Part 360 permit modification\napplication has been submitted are excluded from this requirement. (3)\nA Part 360 permit modification\napplication for a landfill expansion that has been deemed complete by the\ndepartment prior to the effective date of this rulemaking is not subject to\nthis requirement.
