Tit. 12 § 50.23 - Tables\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe tables hereto annexed and designated: \"Table 1-Maximum\n\nPermissible Corneal Exposure for Direct Illumination or Specular Reflection of\n\nLaser Radiation\"; \"Table 2-Maximum Permissible Skin Exposure\"; \"Table 3-Maximum\n\nPermissible Output Densities for Non-Enclosed Laser in an Uncontrolled Area\n(Limits for Low-Intensity Lasers)\"; and \"Table 4-Attenuation of Laser Safety\n\nEyewear\" are hereby made part of this Part (rule). TABLE 1\nMAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE CORNEAL EXPOSURE FOR DIRECT\nILLUMINATION OR SPECULAR REFLECTION OF LASER\nRADIATION\n*\nQ-switched 1\nnanosecond to 1 microsecond pulse [10-\n9\n-\n10-\n6\nsec.]\n(joules/cm\n2\n)\n\nNon-Q-switched 1\nmicrosecond to 0.1 of a second pulse [10-\n6\n-\n10-\n1\nsec.]\n(joules/cm\n2\n)\n\nContinuous wave or\npulse width greater than 0.1 of a second duration [Greater than\n10-\n1\nsec.]\n(watts/cm\n2\n)\n1.0 × 10\n-7 **\n1.0 × 10\n-6 **\n1.0 × 10\n-5 **\n1.0 × 10\n-3 ***\n1.0 × 10\n-2 ***\n1.0 × 10\n-2 ***\n* The values in this table assume a diffraction limited and\nzero order transverse mode beam. In the case of a higher order transverse mode\nin a gas laser where the intrinsic beam divergence exceeds one milliradian the\nvalues may be increased on the basis of experimental evidence. Because of the\nlack of data, no explicit value is listed for the maximum permissible corneal\nexposure for laser radiation in the wave length range below 400 nm. or for\nsub-nanosecond pulses; therefore the cornea shall not be directly exposed to\nthis radiation until MPCE values have been established for these\nconditions. ** For lasers operating in the wave length range 400-1400\nnm. *** For lasers operating in the wave length range above\n1400nn. TABLE 2\nMAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE SKIN\nEXPOSURE\n*\nEnergy Density Pulsed\n[Q-switched, Non-Q-switched]\nPower Density, Continuous Wave\n(joules)\n(watts)\n(cm\n2\n)\n(cm\n2\n)\n0.1\n1.0\n* For lasers operating in the visible, near-infrared and\ninfrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. No information is available\non permissible skin exposures to laser radiation in the wave length range below\n400 nm. Therefore, caution must be used to avoid such exposure until\nexperimental data is available on permissible levels. TABLE 3\nMAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE OUTPUT POWER OR ENERGY DENSITIES\nFOR A NON-ENCLOSED LASER IN AN UNCONTROLLED AREA (LIMITS FOR LOW-INTENSITY\nLASERS)\nQ-switched 1 nanosecond to 1\nmicrosecond pulse [10-\n9\n-\n10-\n6\nsec.]\n(joules/cm\n2\n)\n\nNon-Q-switched 1 microsecond to 0.1 of\na second pulse [10-\n6\n-\n10-\n1\nsec.] (joules/cm\n2\n)\n\nContinuous wave or pulse width greater\nthan 0.1 of a second duration [Greater than 10-\n1\nsec.]\n(watts/cm\n2\n)\n1.0 × 10\n-1\n1.0\n3.0\nTABLE 4\nATTENUATION OF LASER SAFETY\nEYEWEAR\n*\nSuggested Maximum Incident Density\nO.D.

A unit to express a beam intensity\nratio. The decibel is equal to 10 times the logarithm of the beam intensity\nratio expressed by the following equation: n(db) = 10\nlog\n10\n(P\n1\n)/(P\n2\n)\nwhere P\n1\nand P\n2\ndesignate the input and output power density or energy\ndensity, respectively, and \"n\" designates the number of decibels corresponding\nto their ratio. Footnotes\n* The values in this table assume a diffraction limited and\nzero order transverse mode beam. In the case of a higher order transverse mode\nin a gas laser where the intrinsic beam divergence exceeds one milliradian the\nvalues may be increased on the basis of experimental evidence.

Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n50.23\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
