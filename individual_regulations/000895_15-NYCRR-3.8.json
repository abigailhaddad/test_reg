Tit. 15 § 3.8 - Photographic driver licenses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An applicant for any class of driver's\nlicense, except a learner permit is required to submit to a photo imaging\nprocess as part of the licensing procedure. Such applicant may not wear dark\neye glasses, makeup or any apparel which when photographed would obscure the\napplicant's face or make identification difficult. In addition to the fee for a\ndriver's license, an additional fee as provided for in Vehicle and Traffic Law, section 503(2)(f) shall be charged for the issuance of any original, duplicate, renewal or amended license which contains a photo image of the\nlicensee. (b) Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of this section, an applicant for a license may apply for an\nexemption from submitting to a photo imaging as part of the licensing procedure\nif such applicant: (1)\npresents a statement\nfrom a licensed physician. Such statement shall contain the diagnosis of a\nmedical condition (physiological or psychiatric) which includes an explanation\nof why such condition makes it impossible for the applicant to visit a motor\nvehicle issuing office and the period of time such applicant is expected to be\ndisabled. Such exemption may be issued for the duration of such disability; or\n(2)\npresents evidence\nsatisfactory to the commissioner that the taking of the applicant's photograph\nwould violate the applicant's sincerely held religious belief forbidding the\nmaking of photo images.
