(c) Denial, rejection, limitation, suspension, revocation or termination of license or registration. (1)\n\nAny violation of applicable statutes or\nregulations will be a basis to deny, reject, limit, suspend, revoke or\nterminate a license or registration. (2)\n\nConsistent with article 23-A of the\n\nCorrection Law and office guidelines referenced in subdivision two of section\n425\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law, if the office is made aware of the existence of a criminal\nconviction or pending criminal charge concerning the owner of a family day care\nhome, group family day care home, school-age child care program, or child day\ncare center; or concerning any employee, caregiver or volunteer in such homes, programs, or centers; or any person age 18 or over who resides in such a home, such conviction or charge may be a basis to deny, reject, limit, suspend, revoke or terminate the license or registration. When the office is made aware\nof a conviction or charge, the office shall act in accordance with the\nprovisions of section\n413.4\nof this Part. (3)\n\nBefore a license or registration is\nrevoked or terminated, or when an application for a license or registration is\ndenied or rejected, the applicant for or holder of such license or registration\nis entitled to a hearing before the office.

(d) Suspensions or limitations of licenses or registrations.

Such a request must be in writing. (3)\n\nFailure to make such a request will be\nprima facie evidence that the finding of imminent danger is valid, and the\ntemporary suspension or limitation will continue in effect until the office has\ndetermined that the condition requiring such suspension or limitation is\ncorrected or the license or registration is permanently revoked or terminated\npursuant to subdivision (c) of this section. (4)\n\nIf the holder requests a hearing, the\ntemporary suspension or limitation will continue in effect until the office has\ndetermined that the condition requiring such suspension or limitation is\ncorrected, the license or registration is permanently revoked or terminated\npursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, or a hearing decision orders the\nlifting of the suspension or limitation. (5)\n\nThe office may require the program to\npost the notice of suspension or limitation of licensure or registration on the\npremises of the facility.

To the\nmaximum extent possible, the office will make unannounced inspections of the\nrecords and premises of any program after the office receives a complaint that, if true, would indicate such program does not comply with the regulations of\nthe office or with statutory requirements.

(h) Additional local standards, inspections and participation in\nactivities. (1)\n\nWhere an authorized\nagency, as defined in Social Services Law section 371, is subsidizing child day\ncare pursuant to New York State Social Services Law, the authorized agency may\nsubmit to the office, justification for a need to impose additional\nrequirements upon licensed or registered child care programs and a plan to\nmonitor compliance with such additional requirements. No such additional\nrequirements or monitoring may be imposed without the written approval of the\noffice. (2)\n\nAn authorized agency\nmay refuse to allow a licensed or registered child care program that is not in\ncompliance with Social Services Law, office regulations, or any approved\nadditional requirements of the authorized agency to provide child day care to\nthe child.

For this purpose, the date that the revocation or termination became finally effective shall be, as applicable: (i) the date the revocation or\ntermination became effective based on the notice of revocation or\ntermination; (ii)\nthe date the\nhearing decision was issued upholding the revocation or termination; (iii)\nthe date of issuance of a final court\norder affirming the revocation or termination or affirming a hearing decision\nthat upheld the revocation or termination; or\n(iv)\nanother date mutually agreed upon by the\noffice and the licensee or registrant.

(3)\n\nThe office shall deny a new application\nfor licensure or registration made by an individual or entity who is assessed a\nsecond civil penalty by such office for having operated a day care center, group family day care home, family day care home or school-age child care\nprogram without a license or registration for a period of two years from the\ndate of the second fine. For this purpose, the date of the second fine shall be\neither the date upon which the individual or entity signs a stipulation\nagreement to pay the second fine or the date upon which a hearing decision is\nissued affirming the determination of such office to impose the second fine, as\napplicable.
