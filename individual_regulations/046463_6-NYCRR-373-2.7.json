  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.7 - Closure and post-closure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. Except as section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise: (1)\nsubdivision (b) through paragraph (f)(1) of this section (which concern\nclosure) apply to the owners and operators of all hazardous waste management\nfacilities; and\n(2)\nparagraph\n(f)(2) through subdivision (j) of this section (which concerns post-closure\ncare) apply to the owners and operators of: (i) all hazardous waste disposal\nfacilities; (ii)\nwaste piles, and\nsurface impoundments from which the owner or operator intends to remove the\nwastes at closure to the extent that these sections are made applicable to such\nfacilities in sections\n373-2.11\n(f) and\n373-2.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart; (iii)\ntank systems\nthat are required under section\n373-2.10\n(h) of\nthis Subpart to meet the requirements for landfills; and\n(iv)\ncontainment buildings that are required\nunder section\n373-2.30\n(c) of\nthis Subpart to meet the requirements for landfills. (3)\n\nThe department may replace all or part of\nthe requirements of this Subpart (and the unit-specific standards referenced in\nparagraph [b][3] of this section applying to a regulated unit), with\nalternative requirements set out in a permit or in an enforceable document (as\ndefined in section\n373-1.2\n[e][3]\nof\nthis Part), where the department determines that: (i) the regulated unit is situated among\nsolid waste management units (or areas of concern), a release has occurred, and\nboth the regulated unit and one or more solid waste management unit(s) (or\nareas of concern) ae likely to have contributed to the release; and\n(ii)\nit is not necessary to apply the closure\nrequirements of this section (and those referenced herein) because the\nalternative requirements will protect human health and the environment and will\nsatisfy the closure performance standard of paragraph (b)(1) and (2) of this\nsection. (b) Closure performance standard. The owner or operator must close the facility in a manner\nthat: (1)\nminimizes the need for\nfurther maintenance; and\n(2)\ncontrols, minimizes or eliminates, to the extent necessary to protect human\nhealth and the environment, post-closure escape of hazardous waste, hazardous\nconstituents, leachate, contaminated runoff, or hazardous waste decomposition\nproducts to the ground or surface waters or to the atmosphere; and\n(3)\ncomplies with the closure requirements of\nthis Subpart, including but not limited to, the requirements of sections\n373-2.9\n(i), 373-2.10\n(h), 373-2.11\n(f), 373-2.12\n(h), 373-2.13\n(h), 373-2.14\n(g), 373-2.15\n(h), 373-2.24\n(b), (c) and\n(d), and\n373-2.30\n(c) of\nthis Subpart. (c) Closure plan; amendment of plan. (1)\n\nWritten plan. (i) The owner or operator of a hazardous\nwaste management facility must have a written closure plan. In addition, certain surface impoundments and waste piles from which the owner or operator\nintends to remove or decontaminate the hazardous waste at partial or final\nclosure are required by sections\n373-2.11\n(f) and\n373-2.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart to have contingent closure plans. The plan must be submitted with\nthe permit application, in accordance with section\n373-1.5\n(a)(2)(xiii)\nof this Part, and approved by the commissioner as part of the permit issuance\nprocedures under Part 621 of this Title. In accordance with section\n373-1.6\n(c) of this\n\nPart, the approved closure plan will become a condition of any Part 373\npermit. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner's\napproval of the plan must ensure that the approved closure plan is consistent\nwith subdivisions (b) through (f) of this section and the applicable\nrequirements of sections\n373-2.6, 373-2.9\n(i), 373-2.10\n(h). 373-2.11(f), 373-2.12(h), 373-2.13(h), 373-2.14(g), 373-2.15(h), 373-2.24(b)\nand 373-2.30(c) of this Subpart. Until final closure is completed and certified\nin accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a copy of the approved\nplan and all approved revisions must be furnished to the commissioner upon\nrequest, including requests by mail. (2)\n\nContent of plan. The plan must identify\nsteps necessary to perform partial and/or final closure of the facility at any\npoint during its active life. The closure plan must include, at least: (i) a description of how each hazardous waste\nmanagement unit at the facility will be closed in accordance with subdivision\n(b) of this section; (ii)\na\ndescription of how final closure of the facility will be conducted in\naccordance with subdivision (b) of this section. The description must identify\nthe maximum extent of the operations which will be unclosed during the active\nlife of the facility; (iii)\nan\nestimate of the maximum inventory of hazardous wastes ever onsite over the\nactive life of the facility, and a detailed description of the methods to be\nused during partial closures and final closure, including but not limited to\nmethods for removing, transporting, treating, storing or disposing of all\nhazardous wastes, and identification of the types of the offsite hazardous\nwaste management units to be used, if applicable; (iv)\na detailed description of the steps\nneeded to remove or decontaminate all hazardous waste residues and contaminated\ncontainment system components, equipment, structures and soils during partial\nand final closure, including but not limited to procedures for cleaning\nequipment and removing contaminated soils, methods for sampling and testing\nsurrounding soils, and criteria for determining the extent of decontamination\nrequired to satisfy the closure performance standard; (v) a detailed description of other\nactivities necessary during the closure period to ensure that all partial\nclosures and final closure satisfy the closure performance standards, including\nbut not limited to groundwater monitoring, leachate collection, and run-on and\nrunoff control; (vi)\na schedule for\nclosure of each hazardous waste management unit and for final closure of the\nfacility. The schedule must include, at a minimum, the total time required to\nclose each hazardous waste management unit and the time required for\nintervening closure activities which will allow tracking of the progress of\npartial and final closure (for example, in the case of a landfall unit, estimates of the time required to treat or dispose of all hazardous waste\ninventory and of the time required to place a final cover must be\nincluded); (vii)\nfor facilities\nthat use trust funds to establish financial assurance under section\n373-2.8\n(d) or (f)\nof this Subpart and that are expected to close prior to the expiration of the\npermit, an estimate of the expected year of final closure; and\n(viii)\nfor facilities where the department\nhas applied alternative requirements at a regulated unit under sections\n373-2.6\n(a)(6)\nand/or 373-2.8(a)(4) of this Subpart and/or paragraph (a)(3) of this section, either the alternative requirements applying to the regulated unit, or a\nreference to the enforceable document containing those alternative\nrequirements. (3)\n\nAmendment of plan. The owner or operator must submit a written request for a\npermit modification to authorize a change in operating plans, facility design, or the approved closure plan in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 373-1\nof this Part and Part 621 of this Title. The written request must include a\ncopy of the amended closure plan for approval by the commissioner. (i) The owner or operator may submit a\nwritten request to the commissioner for a permit modification to amend the\nclosure plan at any time prior to the notification of partial or final closure\nof the facility. (ii)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must submit a written request for a permit modification to authorize a\nchange in the approved closure plan whenever: (a) changes in operating plans or facility\ndesign affect the closure plan; (b) there is a change in the expected year of closure, if applicable; (c) in conducting partial or final closure\nactivities, unexpected events require a modification of the approved closure\nplan; or\n(d) the owner or operator\nrequests the department to apply alternative requirements to a regulated unit\nunder sections\n373-2.6\n(a)(6)\nand/or 373-2.8(a)(4) of this Subpart and/or paragraph (a)(3) of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nThe owner\nor operator must submit a written request for a permit modification, including\na copy of the amended closure plan for approval at least 60 days prior to the\nproposed change in facility design or operation, or no later than 60 days after\nan unexpected event has occurred which has affected the closure plan. If a\nunexpected event occurs during the partial or final closure period, the owner\nor operator must request a permit modification no later than 30 days after the\nunexpected event. An owner or operator of a surface impoundment or waste pile\nwho intends to remove all hazardous waste at closure and is not otherwise\nrequired to prepare a contingent closure plan under section\n373-2.11\n(f) or\n373-2.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart must submit an amended closure plan to the commissioner no later\nthan 60 days from the date that the owner or operator or commissioner\ndetermines that the hazardous waste management unit must be closed as a\nlandfill subject to the requirements of section\n373-2.14\n(g) of\nthis Subpart, or no later than 30 days from that date if the determination is\nmade during partial or final closure. The commissioner will approve, disapprove\nor modify this amended plan in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 373-1\nof this Part and Part 621 of this Title. In accordance with section\n373-1.6\nof this Part, the approved\nclosure plan will become a condition of any Part 373 permit issued. (iv)\n\nThe commissioner may request\nmodifications to the plan under the conditions described in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph. The owner or operator must submit the modified plan within\n60 days of the commissioner's request, or within 30 days if the change in\nfacility conditions occurs during partial or final closure. Any modifications\nrequested by the commissioner will be approved in accordance with the\nprocedures in Subpart 373-1 of this Part and Part 621 of this Title. (4)\n\nNotification of partial\nclosure and final closure. (i) The owner or\noperator must notify the department in writing at least 60 days prior to the\ndate on which he expects to begin closure of a surface impoundment, waste pile, land treatment or landfill unit, or final closure of a facility with such a\nunit. The owner or operator must notify the department in writing at least 45\ndays prior to the date on which he expects to begin final closure of a facility\nwith only treatment or storage tanks, container storage, or incinerator units\nto be closed. The owner or operator must notify the department in writing at\nleast 45 days prior to the date on which he expects to begin partial or final\nclosure of a boiler or industrial furnace, whichever is earlier. (ii)\n\nThe date when the owner or operator\n\"expects to begin closure\" must be either: (a) no later than 30 days after the date on\nwhich any hazardous waste management unit receives the known final volume of\nhazardous wastes or, if there is a reasonable possibility that the hazardous\nwaste management unit will receive additional hazardous wastes, no later than\none year after the date on which the unit received the most recent volume of\nhazardous wastes. If the owner or operator of a hazardous waste management unit\ncan demonstrate to the commissioner that the hazardous waste management unit or\nfacility has the capacity to receive additional hazardous wastes, and the owner\nor operator has taken, and will continue to take, all steps to prevent threats\nto human health and the environment, including compliance with all applicable\npermit requirements, the commissioner may approve an extension to this one-year\nlimit; or\n(b) for units meeting the\nrequirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, no later than 30 days after\nthe date on which the hazardous waste management unit receives the known final\nvolume of nonhazardous wastes, or if there is a reasonable possibility that the\nhazardous waste management unit will receive additional nonhazardous wastes, no\nlater than one year after the date on which the unit received the most recent\nvolume of nonhazardous wastes. If the owner or operator of a hazardous waste\nmanagement unit can demonstrate to the commissioner that the hazardous waste\nmanagement unit or facility has the capacity to receive additional nonhazardous\nwastes and the owner or operator has taken, and will continue to take, all\nsteps to prevent threats to human health and the environment, including\ncompliance with all applicable permit requirements, the commissioner may\napprove an extension to this one-year limit. (iii)\n\nIf the facility's permit is terminated, or if the facility is otherwise ordered, by judicial decree or final order\nunder article 71 of ECL, to cease receiving hazardous wastes or to close, then\nthe requirements of this paragraph do not apply. However, the owner or operator\nmust close the facility in accordance with the deadlines established in\nsubdivision (d) of this section. (5)\n\nRemoval of wastes and contamination or\ndismantling of equipment. Nothing in this subdivision shall preclude the owner\nor operator from removing hazardous wastes and decontaminating or dismantling\nequipment in accordance with the approved partial or final closure plan at any\ntime before or after notification of partial or final closure. (d) Closure; time allowed\nfor closure. (1)\n\nWithin 90 days\nafter receiving the final volume of hazardous wastes, or the final volume of\nnonhazardous wastes if the owner or operator complies with all applicable\nrequirements in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision, at a hazardous\nwaste management unit or facility, the owner or operator must treat, remove\nfrom the unit or facility, or dispose of onsite, all hazardous wastes in\naccordance with the approved closure plan. The commissioner may approve a\nlonger period if the owner or operator complies with all applicable\nrequirements for requesting a modification to the permit and demonstrates that: (i) (a) the\nactivities required to comply with this subdivision will, of necessity, take\nlonger than 90 days to complete; or\n(b) (1)\nthe\nhazardous waste management unit or facility has the capacity to receive\nadditional hazardous wastes, or has the capacity to receive nonhazardous wastes\nif the owner or operator complies with paragraphs (4) and (5) of this\nsubdivision; (2)\nthere is a\nreasonable likelihood that the owner or operator, or a person other than the\nowner or operator, will recommence operation of the hazardous waste management\nunit or the facility within one year; and\n(3)\nclosure of the hazardous waste management\nunit or facility would be incompatible with continued operation of the site; and\n(ii)\nthe\nowner or operator has taken and will continue to take all steps to prevent\nthreats to human health and the environment, including compliance with all\napplicable permit requirements. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must complete\npartial and final closure activities in accordance with the approved closure\nplan and within 180 days after receiving the final volume of hazardous wastes, or the final volume of nonhazardous wastes if the owner or operator complies\nwith all applicable requirements in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision, at the hazardous waste management unit or facility. The commissioner may\napprove an extension to the closure period if the owner of operator complies\nwith all applicable requirements for requesting a modification to the permit\nand demonstrates that: (i) (a) the partial or final closure activities\nwill, of necessity, take longer than 180 days to complete; or\n(b) (1)\nthe\nhazardous waste management unit or facility has the capacity to receive\nadditional hazardous wastes, or has the capacity to receive nonhazardous wastes\nif the owner or operator complies with paragraphs (4) and (5) of this\nsubdivision; and\n(2)\nthere is\nreasonable likelihood that the owner or a person other than the owner or\noperator will recommence operation of the hazardous waste management unit or\nthe facility within one year; and\n(3)\nclosure of the hazardous waste management\nunit or facility would be incompatible with continued operation of the site; and\n(ii)\nthe\nowner or operator has taken and will continue to take all steps to prevent\nthreats to human health and the environment from the unclosed but not operating\nhazardous waste management unit or facility, including compliance with all\napplicable permit requirements. (3)\n\nThe demonstration referred to in\nsubparagraphs (1)(i) and (2)(i) of this subdivision must be made as follows: (i) the demonstrations in subparagraph (1)(i)\nof this subdivision must be made at least 30 days prior to the expiration of\nthe 90-day period in subparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision; and\n(ii)\nthe demonstration in subparagraph (2)(i)\nof this subdivision must be made at least 30 days prior to the expiration of\nthe 180-day period in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, unless the owner or\noperator is otherwise subject to the deadlines in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision. (4)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may allow an owner or operator to receive only nonhazardous wastes\nin a landfill, land treatment unit, or surface impoundment unit after the final\nreceipt of hazardous wastes at that unit if: (i) the owner or operator requests a permit\nmodification in compliance with all applicable requirements in Subpart 373-1\nand Part 621 of this Title and in the permit modification request demonstrates\nthat: (a) the unit has the existing design\ncapacity as indicated on the Part 373 application to receive nonhazardous\nwastes; and\n(b) there is a\nreasonable likelihood that the owner or operator or another person will receive\nnonhazardous wastes in the unit within one year after the final receipt of\nhazardous wastes; and\n(c) the\nnonhazardous wastes will not be incompatible with any remaining wastes in the\nunit, or with the facility design and operating requirements of the unit or\nfacility under this Part; and\n(d) closure of the hazardous waste management unit would be incompatible with\ncontinued operation of the unit or facility; and\n(e) the owner or operator is operating and\nwill continue to operate in compliance with all applicable permit requirements; and\n(ii)\nthe request to\nmodify the permit includes an amended waste analysis plan, ground- water\nmonitoring and response program, human exposure assessment required under\nsection\n373-1.5\n(d) and (h)\nof this Part, and closure and post-closure plans, and updated cost estimates\nand demonstrations of financial assurance for closure and post-closure care as\nnecessary and appropriate, to reflect any changes due to the presence of\nhazardous constituents in the nonhazardous wastes, and changes in closure\nactivities, including the expected year of closure if applicable under\nsubparagraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section, as a result of the receipt of\nnonhazardous wastes following the final receipt of hazardous wastes; and\n(iii)\nthe request to modify the\npermit includes revisions, as necessary and appropriate, to affected conditions\nof the permit to account for the receipt of non-hazardous wastes following\nreceipt of the final volume of hazardous wastes; and\n(iv)\nthe request to modify the permit and the\ndemonstrations referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph are\nsubmitted to the commissioner no later than 120 days prior to the date on which\nthe owner or operator of the facility receives the known final volume of\nhazardous wastes at the unit, or no later than 90 days after the effective date\nof this rule, whichever is later. (5)\n\nIn addition to the requirements in\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision, an owner or operator of a hazardous waste\nsurface impoundment that is not in compliance with the liner and leachate\ncollection system requirements in sections\n373-2.11\nand\n373-2.14\nof this Subpart, or\nsection\n373-3.11\nor\n373-3.14\nof this Part must: (i) Submit with the request to modify the\npermit: (a) a contingent corrective measures\nplan, unless a corrective action plan has already been submitted under section\n373-2.6\n(j) of this\n\nPart; and\n(b) a plan for removing\nhazardous wastes in compliance with subparagraph (5)(ii) of this subdivision; and\n(ii)\n\nRemove all\nhazardous wastes from the unit by removing all hazardous liquids, and removing\nall hazardous sludges to the extent practicable without impairing the integrity\nof the liner(s), if any. (iii)\n\nRemoval of hazardous wastes must be completed no later than 90 days after the\nfinal receipt of hazardous wastes. The commissioner may approve an extension to\nthis deadline if the owner or operator demonstrates that the removal of\nhazardous wastes will, of necessity, take longer than the allotted period to\ncomplete and that an extension will not pose a threat to human health and the\nenvironment. (iv)\n\nIf a release that\nis a statistically significant increase (or decrease in the case of pH) over\nbackground values for detection monitoring parameters or constituents specified\nin the permit or that exceeds the facility's groundwater protection standard at\nthe point of compliance, if applicable, is detected in accordance with the\nrequirements in section\n373-2.6\nof this Subpart, the owner\nor operator of the unit: (a) must implement\ncorrective measures in accordance with the approved contingent corrective\nmeasures plan required by subparagraph (i) of this paragraph no later than one\nyear after detection of the release, or approval of the contingent corrective\nmeasures plan, whichever is later; (b) may continue to receive wastes at the\nunit following detection of the release only if the approved corrective\nmeasures plan includes a demonstration that continued receipt of wastes will\nnot impede corrective action; and\n(c) may be required by the commissioner to\nimplement corrective measures in less than one year or to cease the receipt of\nwastes until corrective measures have been implemented if necessary to protect\nhuman health and the environment. (v) During the period of corrective action, the owner or operator shall provide annual reports to the department describing\nthe progress of the corrective action program, compile all groundwater\nmonitoring data, and evaluate the effect of the continued receipt of\nnonhazardous wastes on the effectiveness of the corrective action. The\ndepartment may require the owner or operator to report semi-annually as needed\nto evaluate the progress of the corrective action program. (vi)\n\nThe commissioner may require the owner\nor operator to commence closure of the unit if the owner or operator fails to\nimplement corrective action measures in accordance with the approved contingent\ncorrective measures plan within one year as required in subparagraph (iv) of\nthis paragraph, or fails to make substantial progress in implementing\ncorrective action and achieving the facility's groundwater protection standard\nor background levels if the facility has not yet established a ground-water\nprotection standard. (vii)\n\nIf the\nowner or operator fails to implement corrective measures as required in\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, or if the commissioner determines that\nsubstantial progress has not been made pursuant to subparagraph (vi) of this\nparagraph, the commissioner shall: (a) notify\nthe owner or operator in writing that the department is initiating a\nmodification to the permit, pursuant to Part 621, to require the initiation of\nclosure in accordance with the deadlines in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision and provide a detailed statement of reasons for this\ndetermination. (e) Disposal or decontamination of\nequipment, structures and soils. During the partial and final closure periods, all\ncontaminated equipment, structures and soils must be properly disposed of or\ndecontaminated unless otherwise specified in section\n373-2.10\n(b), 373-2.11\n(f), 373-2.12\n(h), 373-2.13\n(h) or\n373-2.14\n(g), or\nunder the authority of section\n373-2.24\n(b) and\n(d) of this Subpart. By removing any\nhazardous waste or hazardous constituents during partial and final closure, the\nowner or operator may become a generator of hazardous waste and must handle\nthat waste in accordance with all applicable requirements of Part 372 of this\n\nTitle. (f) Certification of closure and survey plat. (1)\n\nCertification of closure. Within 60 days\nof completion of final closure of a facility, or within 60 days of partial\nclosure of any hazardous waste management unit, the owner or operator must\nsubmit to the commissioner, by registered mail, a certification that the\nhazardous waste management unit or facility, as applicable, has been closed in\naccordance with the specifications in the approved closure plan. The\ncertification must be signed by the owner or operator and by an independent\nprofessional engineer registered in New York. Documentation supporting the\nindependent registered professional engineer's certification must be furnished\nto the commissioner upon request until the owner or operator is released from\nthe financial assurance requirements for closure under section\n373-2.8\n(d)(8)\nof\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nSurvey plat. No\nlater than the submission of the certification of closure of each hazardous\nwaste disposal unit, the owner or operator must submit to the local zoning\nauthority, or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use, and to the\ncounty clerk in the county in which the facility is located, and to the\ncommissioner, a survey plat indicating the location and dimensions of landfill\ncells or other hazardous waste disposal units with respect to permanently\nsurveyed benchmarks. This plat must be prepared and certified by a professional\nland surveyor registered in New York. The plat filed with the local zoning\nauthority, or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use, and with the\ncounty clerk in the county in which the facility is located, must contain a\nnote, prominently displayed, which states the owner's or operator's obligation\nto restrict disturbance of the hazardous waste disposal unit in accordance with\nthe applicable regulations of this section. (g) Post-closure care and use of\nproperty. (1)\n(i) Post-closure care for each hazardous\nwaste management unit subject to the requirements of subdivisions (g) through\n(j) of this section must begin after completion of closure of the unit and\ncontinue for 30 years after that date, and must consist of at least the\nfollowing: (a) monitoring and reporting in\naccordance with the requirements of sections\n373-2.6, 373-2.11, 373-2.12, 373-2.13, 373-2.14 and\n373-2.24\nof this Subpart; and\n(b) maintenance and monitoring\nof waste containment systems in accordance with the requirements of sections\n373-2.6, 373-2.12, 373-2.13, 373-2.14 and\n373-2.24\nof this Subpart. (ii)\n\nAny time preceding partial\nclosure of a hazardous waste management unit subject to post-closure care\nrequirements or final closure, or at any time during the post-closure period\nfor a particular unit, the commissioner may, in accordance with the permit\nmodification procedures in Subpart 373-1 of this Part and Part 621 of this\n\nTitle: (a) shorten the post-closure care\nperiod applicable to the hazardous waste management unit or facility (if all\ndisposal units have been closed) if the commissioner finds that the reduced\nperiod is sufficient to protect human health and the environment (e.g., leachate or ground-water monitoring results, characteristics of the hazardous\nwastes, application of advanced technology, or alternative disposal, treatment\nor reuse techniques indicate that the hazardous waste management unit or\nfacility is secure); or\n(b) extend\nthe post-closure care period applicable to the hazardous waste management unit\nor facility if the commissioner finds that the extended period is necessary to\nprotect human health and the environment (e.g., leachate or ground-water\nmonitoring results indicate a potential for migration of hazardous wastes at\nlevels which may be harmful to human health and the environment). (2)\n\nThe commissioner\nmay require, at partial and final closure, continuation of any of the security\nrequirements of section\n373-2.2\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart during part or all of the post-closure period when: (i) hazardous wastes may remain exposed after\ncompletion of partial or final closure; or\n(ii)\naccess by the public or domestic\nlivestock may pose a hazard to human health. (3)\n\nPost-closure use of property on or in\nwhich hazardous wastes remain after partial or final closure must never be\nallowed to disturb the integrity of the final cover, liners, or any other\ncomponents of the containment system, or the function of the facility's\nmonitoring systems, unless the commissioner finds that the disturbance: (i) is necessary to the proposed use of the\nproperty, and will not increase the potential hazard to human health or the\nenvironment; or\n(ii)\nis necessary\nto reduce a threat to human health or the environment. (4)\n\nAll post-closure care activities must be\nin accordance with the provisions of the approved post-closure plan as\nspecified in subdivision (h) of this section. (h) Post-closure plan; amendment of\nplan. (1)\n\nWritten plan. The owner or\noperator of a hazardous waste disposal unit must have a written post-closure\nplan. In addition, certain surface impoundments and waste piles from which the\nowner or operator intends to remove or decontaminate the hazardous wastes at\npartialor final closure are required by sections\n373-2.11\n(f) and\n373-2.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart to have contingent post-closure plans. Owners or operators of\nsurface impoundments and waste piles not otherwise required to prepare\ncontingent post-closure plans under sections\n373-2.11\n(f) and\n373-2.12\n(h) must\nsubmit a post-closure plan to the commissioner within 90 days from the date\nthat the owner or operator or commissioner determines that the hazardous waste\nmanagement unit must be closed as a landfill, subject to the rerquirements of\nsubdivisions (g)-(j) of this section.
