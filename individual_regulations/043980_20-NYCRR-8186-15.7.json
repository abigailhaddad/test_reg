  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-15.7 - Certain sample parcel appraisal objections\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In reviewing an objection to an\nappraisal, if ORPTS determines that notwithstanding a complaint that the\nappraised value is too high, that such value should be higher, or, notwithstanding a complaint that the appraised value is too low, that such\nvalue should be lower, the value shall not be changed for purposes of the\ncomputation of the State equalization rate, class equalization rate or class\nratios for that year. The appraised value of such sample parcel may be changed\nin the market value survey or surveys for purposes of any future computations\nbased in whole or in part upon such survey or surveys. (b) In reviewing an assertion that an\naggregate full value, full value estimate for a major type, or level of\nassessment for an assessment roll or a major type is incorrect, if ORPTS\ndetermines that notwithstanding a complaint that the aggregate full value, full\nvalue estimate for a major type, or level of assessment for an assessment roll\nor a major type is too high, that such number should be higher, or, notwithstanding a complaint that the aggregate full value, full value estimate\nfor a major type, or level of assessment for an assessment roll or a major type\nis too low, that such number should be lower, the number shall not be changed\nfor purposes of the computation of the State equalization rate, class\nequalization rate or class ratios for that year. The determinations made in\nreviewing such a complaint may be changed in the market value survey for\npurposes of any future computations based in whole or in part upon such survey\nor surveys or in the conduct of another market value survey.
