  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.25 - Exhibit 25: effect on transportation\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 25 shall contain: (a) A conceptual site plan, drawn at an\nappropriate scale, depicting all facility site driveway and roadway\nintersections, showing: (1)\nfor generation\nfacility sites other than for wind turbines, horizontal and vertical geometry, the number of approach lanes, the lane widths, shoulder widths, traffic control\ndevices by approaches, and sight distances; (2)\nfor wind turbine sites, access road\nlocations and widths, including characterizations of road intersection\nsuitability. (b) A\ndescription of the pre-construction characteristics of the roadways in the\nvicinity of the facility, including: (1)\na\nreview of existing data on vehicle traffic, use levels and accidents; (2)\na review of transit facilities and\nroutes, including areas of school bus service; (3)\nan identification of potential approach\nand departure routes to and from the facility site for police, fire, ambulance\nand other emergency vehicles; (4)\na\nreview of available load bearing and structural rating information for expected\nfacility traffic routes; and\n(5)\nin\ncongested urbanized areas, the results of 24 hour traffic volume counts and\npeak turning movement counts for typical weekday morning, weekday afternoon, and Saturday peaks, at representative critical intersections. (c) An estimate of the trip\ngeneration characteristics of the facility during both construction and\noperation, including: (1)\nfor each major phase\nof construction, and for the operation phase, an estimate of the number and\nfrequency of vehicle trips, including time of day and day of week arrival and\ndeparture distribution, by size, weight and type of vehicle; (2)\nan identification of approach and\ndeparture routes to and from the facility site out to a 5-mile distance for\nvehicles carrying water, fuel oil, bulk fuels (including wood, biomass, coal\nand municipal solid waste), chemicals or hazardous materials for construction\nor operation of the facility; (3)\nfor major cut or fill activity (spoil removal or deposition at the facility\nsite and affected interconnection areas), a separate estimate of the number and\nfrequency of vehicle trips, including time of day and day of week arrival and\ndeparture distribution, and including a delineation of approach and departure\nroutes, by size, weight and type of vehicle; and\n(4)\nan identification of approach and\ndeparture routes to and from the facility site for construction workers and\nemployees of the facility. (d) An analysis and evaluation of the traffic\nand transportation impacts of the facility, including: (1)\na comparison of projected future traffic\nconditions with and without the proposed facility, the analysis to be conducted\nseparately for the peak construction impacts of the facility and for the\ntypical operations of the completed facility, including in congested urbanized\nareas a calculation and comparison of the level of service for each\nrepresentative intersection, giving detail for each turning movement; (2)\nan evaluation of the adequacy of the road\nsystem to accommodate the projected traffic, the analysis to be conducted\nseparately for the peak construction impacts of the facility and for the\ntypical operations of the completed facility, the analysis to also include an\nidentification of the extent and duration of traffic interferences during\nconstruction of the facility and any interconnections; (3)\nan assessment of over-size load\ndeliveries, and the adequacy of roadway systems to accommodate oversize and\nover-weight vehicles; improvements necessary to accommodate oversize or\noverweight deliveries; impacts associated with such improvements; and\nmitigation measures appropriate to minimize such impacts; (4)\nan identification and evaluation of\npracticable mitigation measures regarding traffic and transportation impacts, including time restrictions, the use of alternative technologies, the\nconstruction of physical roadway improvements, the installation of new traffic\ncontrol devices, and the repair of local roads due to damage by heavy equipment\nor construction activities during construction or operation of the facility; and\n(5)\na description of all road\nuse and restoration agreements, if any, between the applicant and landowners, municipalities, or other entities, regarding repair of local roads damaged by\nheavy equipment or construction activities during construction or operation of\nthe facility. (e) An\nanalysis and evaluation of the impacts of the facility on airports and\nairstrips, railroads, subways, buses and any other mass transit systems in the\nvicinity of the facility. The analysis and evaluation shall include impacts on\nmilitary training and frequent military operations in the National Airspace\n\nSystem and Special Use Airspace designated by the Federal Aviation\n\nAdministration. (f) If any\nconstruction or alteration is proposed that requires a Notice of Proposed\n\nConstruction to be submitted to the administrator of the Federal Aviation\n\nAdministration (FAA) in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations, part 77\npursuant to\n49\nU.S.C., section\n44718\n(generally required for\nall construction or alteration of more than 200 feet in height above the ground\nlevel, and for certain other construction or alteration near or at civilian\npublic airports and heliports and military airports and heliports or in\ninstrument approach areas as defined by the FAA): (1)\n\nThe application shall include a statement\nthat the applicant has: (i) received an\ninformal Department of Defense review of the proposed construction or\nalteration in accordance with 32 Code of Federal Regulations, section 211.7; or\n(ii)\nreceived a formal\n\nDepartment of Defense review of the proposed construction or alteration in\naccordance with 32 Code of Federal Regulations, section 211.6. (2)\n\nIf such construction or\nalteration is proposed to be located: (i) within 12 miles of the nearest point of the nearest runway of a commercial\nservice, cargo service, reliever or general aviation (public use) airport or a\nmilitary airport with at least one runway more than 3,200 feet in actual\nlength; or\n(ii)\nwithin six miles of\nthe nearest point of the nearest runway of a commercial service, cargo service, reliever or general aviation (public use) airport or a military airport with\nits longest runway no more than 3,200 feet in actual length; or\n(iii)\nwithin three miles of the nearest point\nof the nearest point of the nearest landing and takeoff area of a commercial\nservice, cargo service, reliever or general aviation (public use) heliport or\nmilitary heliport: The application shall include a statement that the\napplicant has consulted with the operators of such airports and heliports that\nare non-military facilities, has provided a detailed map and description of\nsuch construction or alteration to such operators, and has requested review of\nand comment on such construction or alteration by such operators. The application shall include a statement that the\napplicant has provided a detailed map and description of such construction or\nalteration to the operators (base commanders) of such airports and heliports\nthat are military facilities. (3)\n\nThe application shall include a detailed\ndescription of the responses received in such reviews and consultations\nrequired in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, including specifically\nwhether and why such operators believe such construction or alteration should\nbe: (i) unrestricted; (ii)\nsubject to site-specific requirements; or\n(iii)\nexcluded from certain\nareas.
