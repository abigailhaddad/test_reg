  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 2.2 - Advertisement of compounding method\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhile it is the policy of the Banking Board to encourage\nthe payment of the maximum permitted interest rates on savings and time\naccounts, provided sufficient earnings are available to make such payments, it\nis the Board's belief that advertisements which give prominence to statements\nsuch as interest is \"compounded continuously\", \"compounded every minute of the\nday\", \"compounded every second\" or \"compounded even while you sleep\" may be\nconfusing. Accordingly, the following guidelines are established for\nadvertisements which refer to compounding interest for periods of less than one\nday: (a) the reference to the basis of\ncompounding shall be limited to the word \"compounded\" and the actual time\nperiod or interval used; further, such reference shall not be emphasized or\notherwise given prominence within the advertisement and, in the case of a\nprinted advertisement, shall not appear in a type size which is larger than\nthat of the text of such advertisement; (b) the advertisement shall state prominently\nthe effective annual yield achieved by compounding on the basis used as well as\nthe simple annual interest rate in accordance with subsection\n2.1\nhereof; (c) the advertisement shall state the\nmonetary difference in the amount earned annually, on the sum of $1,000, between the method of compounding used and compounding on a daily basis; and\n(d) no further statement\nregarding the basis of compounding, which is not specifically permitted by this\nsubsection\n2.2, shall be included in such\nadvertisement. Irrespective of the description of the method of\ncompounding used, the maximum interest rate permitted by the appropriate\nregulatory authority may be paid. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n2.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
