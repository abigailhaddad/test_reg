Tit. 3 § 22.19 - Restrictions on ownership of participations by trustee\n\nState Regulations\nA trust company administering a common trust fund shall\nnot: (a) have any interest in such\nfund other than in its fiduciary capacity; or\n(b) make any loans on the security of a\nparticipation in such fund. If because of a creditor relationship or otherwise the trust\ncompany acquires an interest in a participation in such fund the participation\nshall be withdrawn on the first date on which such withdrawal can be effected. However, in no case shall an unsecured advance to an account holding a\nparticipation until the time of the next withdrawal be deemed to constitute the\nacquisition of an interest by the trust company. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n22.19\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
