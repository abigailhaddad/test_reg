The tenant's acceptance of such offer shall be entered on the\ndesignated part of the prescribed form, or facsimile thereof, and returned to\nthe owner by mail or personal delivery. Pursuant to the provisions of section\n2522.5\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Title, the owner shall furnish to such tenant a copy of the fully executed\nrenewal lease form bearing the signatures of the owner and tenant within 30\ndays of the owner's receipt of the renewal lease form signed by the tenant. Upon execution by the owner and delivery to the tenant, such form shall\nconstitute a binding renewal lease. Upon failure of the owner to deliver a copy\nof the fully executed renewal lease form to the tenant within 30 days from the\nowner's receipt of such form signed by the tenant, such tenant shall not be\ndeprived of any of his or her rights under the RSL and this Code and the owner\nshall be barred from commencing any action or proceeding against the tenant\nbased upon nonrenewal of lease, pursuant to section\n2524.3\n(f) of this\n\nTitle. In the event that such notice is given to the tenant after the\nexpiration of the lease, the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section\nshall govern. (b) (1)\n\nUnless otherwise prohibited by occupancy\nrestrictions based upon income limitations pursuant to federal, state or local\nlaw, regulations or other requirements of governmental agencies, if an offer is\nmade to the tenant pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a) of this\nsection and such tenant has permanently vacated the housing accommodation, any\nmember of such tenant's family, as defined in section\n2520.6\n(o) of this\n\nTitle, who has resided with the tenant in the housing accommodation as a\nprimary residence for a period of no less than two years, or where such person\nis a \"senior citizen,\" or a \"disabled person\" as defined in paragraph (4) of\nthis subdivision, for a period of no less than one year, immediately prior to\nthe permanent vacating of the housing accommodation by the tenant, or from the\ninception of the tenancy or commencement of the relationship, if for less than\nsuch periods, shall be entitled to be named as a tenant on the renewal\nlease. (2)\nA tenant shall be\nconsidered to have permanently vacated the subject housing accommodation when\nthe tenant has permanently ceased residing in the housing accommodation. The\ncontinued payment of rent by the tenant or the signing of renewal leases shall\nnot preclude a claim by a family member as defined in section\n2520.6\n(o) of this\n\nTitle in seeking tenancy. (3)\n\nThe\nminimum periods of required residency set forth in this subdivision shall not\nbe deemed to be interrupted by any period during which the \"family member\"\ntemporarily relocates because he or she: (i) is engaged in active military duty; (ii)\nis enrolled as a full-time\nstudent; (iii)\nis not in residence\nat the housing accommodation pursuant to a court order not involving any term\nor provision of the lease, and not involving any grounds specified in the Real\n\nProperty Actions and Proceedings Law; (iv)\nis engaged in employment requiring\ntemporary relocation from the housing accommodation; (v) is hospitalized for medical treatment; or\n(vi)\nhas such other reasonable\ngrounds that shall be determined by the DHCR upon application by such\nperson. (4)\n\nThe 60-day\nperiod from the date of service of the Notice for Renewal of Lease for\nacceptance and renewal provided to the tenant in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, shall also apply to the tenant's \"family member.\"\n(5)\n\nFor the purposes of this subdivision (b), \"disabled person\" is defined as a person who has an impairment which results\nfrom anatomical, physiological or psychological conditions, other than\naddiction to alcohol, gambling, or any controlled substance, which are\ndemonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic\ntechniques, and which are expected to be permanent and which substantially\nlimit one or more of such person's major life activities. (c) (1)\n\nWhere the owner fails to timely offer a renewal lease or rental agreement in\naccordance with subdivision (a) of this section, the one- or two-year lease\nterm selected by the tenant shall commence at the tenant's option, either (i)\non the date a renewal lease would have commenced had a timely offer been made, or (ii) on the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days after the\ndate that the owner does offer the lease to the tenant. In either event, the\neffective date of the increased rent under the renewal lease shall commence on\nthe first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days after such offer is\nmade by the owner, and the guidelines rate applicable shall be no greater than\nthe rate in effect on the commencement date of the lease for which a timely\noffer should have been made. (2)\n\nWhere the tenant fails to timely renew an expiring lease or rental agreement\noffered pursuant to this section, and remains in occupancy after expiration of\nthe lease, such lease or rental agreement may be deemed to be in effect, for\nthe purpose of determining the rent in an overcharge proceeding, where such\ndeeming would be appropriate pursuant to Real Property Law section 232-c. In\nsuch event, the expiring lease will be deemed to have been renewed upon the\nsame terms and conditions, at the legal regulated rent, together with any\nguidelines adjustments that would have been applicable had the offer of a\nrenewal lease been timely accepted. Unless otherwise dictated by Real Property\n\nLaw section 232-c, the effective date of the rent adjustment under the \"deemed\"\nrenewal lease shall commence on the first rent payment date occurring no less\nthan 90 days after such offer is made by the owner.

(d) Except as\nprovided in Part 2524 of this Title, the failure to offer a renewal lease\npursuant to this section shall not deprive the tenant of any protections or\nrights provided by the RSL and this Code and the tenant shall continue to have\nthe same rights as if the expiring lease were still in effect. (e) On a form prescribed or a facsimile of\nsuch form approved by the DHCR, a tenant may, at any time, advise the owner, or\nan owner may request from the tenant at any time, but no more often than once\nin any 12 months, the names of all persons other than the tenant who are\nresiding in the housing accommodation, and the following information pertaining\nto such persons: (1)\nif the person is a\n\"family member\" as defined in subdivision (o) of section\n2520.6\nof this Title; and\n(2)\nif the person is, or upon the passage of\nthe applicable minimum period of required residency, may become a person\nentitled to be named as a tenant on a renewal lease pursuant to subdivision\n(b)(1) of this section, and the date of the commencement of such person's\nprimary residence with the tenant; and\n(3)\nif the person is a \"senior citizen\" or a\n\"disabled person\" as defined in section\n2520.6\n(p) of this\n\nTitle, and subdivision (b)(4) of this section.
