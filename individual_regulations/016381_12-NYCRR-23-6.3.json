  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-6.3 - Material platform or bucket hoists\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Design requirement. Every material\nplatform or bucket hoist erected after June 1, 1972 shall be designed by a\nprofessional engineer licensed to practice in the State of New York. The design\nplans and specifications for any such hoist shall be kept on the job site\navailable for examination by the commissioner. (b) Material hoist towers. (1)\n\nThe tower of every material hoist shall\nbe supported by a firm foundation of such dimensions and area as to adequately\ndistribute the intended load so as not to exceed the safe load-bearing capacity\nof the supporting soil. Tower bracing shall be constructed of such material and\nshall be so installed as to secured tower stability and rigidity and to keep\nthe tower plumb. (2)\n\nEach such\ntower shall be secured with guys or rigid braces at each corner at intervals\nnot to exceed 26 feet vertically. Tower guys shall be at least one-half inch\ndiameter improved plow steel wire rope and shall be securely fastened to\nadequate anchorages with wire rope clips in accordance with Table XVI of this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nThe erection and\ndismantling of any material hoist tower shall be performed only under the\ndirect supervision of a designated person experienced in this type of work. Timber hoist towers shall be erected only to a height necessary for the\nperformance of the work and shall be extended in height only when the\nconstruction work has progressed sufficiently to provide for the anchorages and\nbracing heretofore required. Hoist towers constructed of metal shall not be\nerected to a height exceeding 50 feet above the highest portion of the\nbuildings or other structures which may be used as suitable anchorages for\nguying such towers. (4)\n\nHoist\ntowers shall be so constructed that there shall be at least four feet of\nclearance between the lowest point on the circumference of the cathead sheave\nand the highest point on the hoisting rope fastening on the car or bucket when\nsuch conveyance is at the uppermost terminal or landing. (c) Hoistway enclosures. (1)\n\nInterior. Interior hoistways for material\nhoists shall be enclosed at every floor level to a height of at least eight\nfeet on all sides except entrance openings. Such enclosures shall be\nconstructed of wire mesh of not less than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings\nwhich will reject a one-half inch diameter ball or such enclosures shall be\npartitions of exterior grade plywood at least three-quarters inch thick, of\nwood slats not less than three-quarters inch thick installed horizontally and\nspaced not more than two inches apart or of other material of equivalent\nstrength. Such enclosures shall be adequately supported, braced and\nsecured. (2)\n\nEnclosed exterior. When any exterior hoistway for a material hoist is enclosed, such enclosure\nshall extend from the lowest terminal points to the cathead elevations on all\nsides except entrance openings. Such enclosures shall be constructed of wire\nmesh of not less than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings which will reject a\none-half inch diameter ball. (3)\n\nUnenclosed exterior. When any exterior hoistway for a material hoist is\nunenclosed, the following requirements shall apply: (i) Such hoistway shall be enclosed at the\nground or grade level to a height of at least six feet on all sides except\nentrance openings. Such enclosure shall be constructed of wire mesh of not less\nthan No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings which will reject a one-half inch\ndiameter ball. Entrance openings of any such hoistway shall be provided with\ngates or bars in compliance with this Part (rule) except that sliding bars may\nbe used in lieu of hinged bars. Such gates or bars shall be kept closed\nwhenever the car is hoisted. (ii)\n\nIn addition to the enclosure of the hoist car as required by this Part (rule), each loading side of any such car shall be provided with a self-closing gate at\nleast 66 inches in height, constructed of the same material as the car\nenclosure. (iii)\n\nWhere any point on\na moving car or counterweight of a material hoist passes less than eight feet\nfrom a floor, roof, scaffold platform or other work surface or position, such\nfloor, roof, scaffold platform or other work surface shall be provided with a\npartition at least six feet in height. Such partition shall extend horizontally\nat least five feet past the horizontal projection of the path of the car or\ncounterweight. Such partition shall be at least equal in construction to\nhoistway enclosures as specified in this Part (rule). (d) Entrances to hoistways. (1)\n\nAll entrances to any hoistway used for\nmaterial hoisting above the lowest loading terminal or grade entrance shall be\nguarded by substantial gates painted fluorescent orange or yellow. When closed, such gates shall guard the full width of the entrance openings. The top of each\nsuch gate shall be at least 36 inches in height above the floor surface when\nlocated two feet or more from the hoistway line. Any such gate located less\nthan two feet from the hoistway line shall be not less than 66 inches in height\nabove the floor surface. If such entrance gates are constructed with a grille, wire mesh, lattice or other openwork material, the openings therein shall\nreject a ball more than two inches in diameter. Any such gate shall have an\nunderclearance of not more than two inches. Such entrance gates shall be either\nvertical sliding, horizontal sliding or swinging gates. Any swinging gate shall\nswing in the direction of egress from the car to the floor. (2)\n\nAt the lowest loading terminal or grade\nentrance, a wood or metal bar may be used to guard the entrance to a hoistway\nused for material hoisting. Such bar shall be painted fluorescent orange or\nyellow. Such bar shall be mechanically or electrically interlocked with the\nhoist car so that the bar shall be closed and locked before the car can leave\nthe lowest terminal or grade level and cannot be opened until the car has\nreturned to such level. (3)\n\nBars or\npipes shall not be used to guard hoistway entrances at any level or floor above\nthe lowest terminal or grade level. (4)\n\nGates at hoistway entrances above the\nlowest terminal or grade level shall be kept closed when the car is not at such\nentrances. (e) Car\nconstruction. (1)\n\nHoist cars used for\nmaterial hoisting shall be enclosed from floor to crosshead with solid\nenclosures on all sides not used for loading or unloading. Every such hoist car\nshall be provided with overhead protection installed at the crosshead to\nprotect any person from falling objects or materials. Such overhead protection\nshall consist of planking at least two inches thick, exterior grade plywood at\nleast three-quarters inch thick or other material of equivalent\nstrength. (2)\n\nIn lieu of solid\nenclosures, hoist cars may be enclosed with expanded metal of not less than No. 9 U.S. gage steel with openings which will reject a one and one-half inch\ndiameter ball. Such enclosed cars shall also be provided with toeboards at\nleast four inches in height on all sides except those used for loading and\nunloading. (3)\n\nCar platforms shall\nbe provided with securely fastened blocks and cleats to prevent the rolling of\nwheeled vehicles and the shifting of other equipment. (f) Guide rails. The guide rails of material\nhoists shall be constructed of steel or sound, structural grade hardwood\nsecurely fastened at intervals so as not to deflect more than one-quarter inch\nduring normal operation of the hoist. (g) Operation of hoist. The operation of any\nhoist car, bucket or platform is prohibited whenever persons are climbing the\nhoist tower or working on any part of the tower below the cathead. Exception:The platform, cage, car or bucket may be used\nto raise persons for authorized maintenance and repairs that cannot be done\notherwise. (h) Protection\nof operator. The operator of every hoisting machine used with material platform\nor bucket hoists shall be provided with overhead protection against falling\nobjects or materials. Such overhead protection shall be equivalent to tight\nplanking not less than two inches thick supported to develop its full\nstrength. (i) Loading and roping of\nplatform hoists. The maximum safe capacity of each platform hoist shall be\ndetermined by using a factor of safety of eight. Such maximum safe capacity\nshall be posted conspicuously on the crosshead or side members of every such\nhoist and such capacity shall not be exceeded. (j) Thoroughfare. Hoistways for material\nhoists shall not be located either partially or wholly over sidewalks, passageways or other areas to which persons have access unless a broken-rope\nsafety device is provided for each such hoistway. Such safety devices shall be\ncapable of stopping and holding the platform or bucket with its rated load. Such safety device requirement shall also apply to the counterweights of such\nhoists, if provided. (k) Riding. Riding by any person on a material hoist is prohibited except for necessary\ninspection, maintenance and repairs. Signs to that effect shall be posted in\nconspicuous locations on both sides of the crosshead or side members and at\nevery entrance to any such hoist. The legend on every such sign, in letters not\nless than one and one-half inches in height on contrasting backgrounds, shall\nread as follows: \"WARNING--RIDING BY ANY PERSON\nPROHIBITED\"\nNotes\nN.Y.
