(e) If an employer in good faith\nengages in two or more unrelated types or kinds of trade, business or\noccupation, each such unrelated trade, business or occupation shall be deemed\nan employment, regardless of whether carried on at one or more places of\nemployment.

(i) Any employments in which hiring is for a\ndaily period, or for a period of less than a day, and in which it is a usual\nemployment practice to recruit occasional workers who are normally engaged in\nperforming services in a different occupation, the labor and services of such\nworkers for less than 30 days in a calendar year are to be construed as casual\nemployment. (ii)\n\nLabor or services\nnot in a regular and usual course of the employer's trade, business or\noccupation, and which are occasional or incidental, is to be construed as\ncasual employment; but an employment which recurs frequently and is\ncharacteristic of the employer's regular and usual conduct of his business is\nnot to be construed as casual employment, except as provided in subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph.

Written statements submitted to the employer by the employee at\nor about the time of employment, setting forth pertinent facts, shall be\nconsidered presumptive evidence of whether or not the employee is in extra\nemployment. (h) Whenever an employer claims that any\nemployment is not an employment under this law, the burden shall be on the\nemployer to prove the exemption claimed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
