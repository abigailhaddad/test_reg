  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7920.4 - Program rebates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. To be eligible for a program rebate, the total cost of the project, including any in-kind services being claimed as part or all of the applicant's\nmatching share, must not exceed $50,000. The rebates shall be available for 50\npercent of the total project cost up to a maximum rebate of $25,000. Rebates\nshall be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis until all funds allocated\nfor rebates are exhausted. (b) Per-facility limitations. Program rebates shall be limited to $25,000 per\n12-month period for each facility to be improved. (c) Per-applicant limitations. In no event\nmay an applicant which owns or leases more than one facility receive more than\n$100,000 in rebates in any 12- month period. (d) Other limitations. (1)\n\nOnly one rebate application per facility\nwill be accepted during any 12- month period. (2)\n\nRebate applications for additional\nprojects at facilities previously awarded a rebate under this program will not\nbe accepted unless the previous project for which a rebate was awarded has been\ncertified as 100 percent complete. The Energy Office may waive such limitation\nwhere, despite the due diligence of the applicant, an unanticipated\ncircumstance or event renders compliance impracticable. (3)\n\nAn energy conservation improvement that\nwould otherwise exceed the $50,000 limit to implement may not be carried out\nincrementally to enable portions of the improvement to be eligible for more\nthan one rebate under this program. (e) In no event shall rebates be available\nfor the installation of energy conservation measures for which an applicant has\nreceived financial assistance for such purpose under other Federal or State\nenergy conservation programs. (f) Joint applications. A joint application may be submitted by a group of eligible\napplicants occupying the same building for projects that are mutually\nbeneficial ( e.g., boiler replacements or HVAC improvements). Each of such\neligible applicants shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this\nsection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
