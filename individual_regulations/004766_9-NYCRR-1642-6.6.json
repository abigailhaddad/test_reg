  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-6.6 - Workmen's compensation insurance\n\nState Regulations\n\nAlternative procedures for handling advance or deposit\npremiums on workmen's compensation insurance are possible depending on whether\nthe emphasis is placed on the advance or deposit aspects of such premium. In\norder to attain uniform accounting practice and terminology, however, the\nadvance or deposit premium for workmen's compensation insurance should be\ncharged to account 1212, Anticipated Returnable Premiums. At the end of each\nquarter, the periodical charge based on the actual payroll should be made to\ncost or expense and the liability accrued in account 2136, Accrued Insurance. At the end of the policy period, the insurance carrier will, generally\nspeaking, make an audit of the payroll for the period and render an invoice, debit or credit, for the adjusted premium due. The bookkeeper will check the\ninvoice in order to determine whether or not the invoice as submitted by the\ninsurance carrier is correct. If the invoice is correct, the accrued liability\naccount (2136) should be adjusted in accordance with the invoice. The deposit\npremium (1212) is then applied against the accrued liability account (2136) by\nmeans of a journal voucher. Any excess of deposit premium over the accrued\nliability, as adjusted, should be recovered from the insurance\ncarrier. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-6.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
