  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.12 - Mozzarella cheese standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality mozzarella cheese must be made using\nonly New York State milk and must meet the fat and moisture standards as set\nforth in 1 NYCRR Part\n17, section 17.67 for whole milk mozzarella, section\n17.68 for part skim mozzarella, section 17.69 for low moisture, whole milk\nmozzarella and section 17.70 for low moisture, part skim mozzarella. The\ndetermination of the Seal of Quality grade of mozzarella cheese shall be on the\nbasis of rating (A) flavor, (B) body and texture, (C) color, (D) finish and\nappearance, and (E) melt (for low moisture cheeses only). The rating of each\nquality factor shall be established on the basis of characteristics present in\ncheese from any sample. The final grade shall be established on the basis of\nthe lowest rating of any one of the quality characteristics. Seal of Quality\nmozzarella cheese shall conform to the following requirements and standards: (1)\n\nFlavor. Shall possess desirable and\npleasing flavor and odor characteristics. It may possess bitter, fruity, metallic/oxidized, and unclean type flavors, upon critical examination, to a\nvery slight degree. It may possess acid, cooked, and feed type flavors to a\nslight degree. Cheese may have a flat and salt flavor to a definite degree. A\nsalt flavor cannot be to the extent that the natural cheese flavor is masked\nover. Mozzarella cheese may not possess fermented, rancid, or yeasty flavors to\nany degree. (2)\n\nBody and texture. Mozzarella cheese of this grade shall be firm bodied, whole milk mozzarella may\nbe less firm than low moisture, part skim. Cheese shall have uniform firmness\non all sides. The texture must be smooth, with the exception that a slight\nroughness to the surface due to salt may be apparent. The texture and body of\nthe cheese should be smooth and springy, very close and uniform, and not have a\ncorky or curdy appearance. Whole milk mozzarella is permitted a slight degree\nof free fat on the interior surfaces. While the texture of low moisture, part\nskim mozzarella cheese should be devoid of free fat on the interior surfaces. In addition, the cheese must be free of any evidence of gas formation, a few\nslits may be noted in the interior, however, such slits shall not be the result\nof gas formation. Shredded cheese in bulk or retail packages shall be\nreasonably uniform in size and be reasonably free of caking. (3)\n\nColor. Cheese may be white to a light\ncreamy color but should not have a dull chalky appearance. The color may be\nslightly wavy in appearance. The surface of the cheese should have a glossy\nsheen. Any mottling or unnatural coloration shall not be present. (4)\n\nFinish and appearance. The wrapper or\ncovering shall adequately and securely envelop the cheese, be neat, unbroken\nand fully protect the surface but may be slightly wrinkled. The basic shape of\nthe cheese shall be reasonably uniform throughout. Sides may be slightly\nrounded but not appear huffed which could indicate the presence of gas. To a\nslight degree, cracks could be present on the surface. There shall not be any\nmold on the surface or within the cheese. Edges may be rounded to a\ndegree. (5)\n\nMelt (applies to low\nmoisture cheeses only). When melted on a pizza shell, mozzarella cheese should\nnot show excessive blistering, or burning, or unnatural coloration. There shall\nonly be very slight signs of free oil on the surface of the melted cheese. Cheese should melt down and uniformly cover the surface. The mouth-feel of the\ncheese should be smooth. Cheese of this grade should have at least a six inch\nstretch and show a firm string when lifted with a fork. In all cases where\nother defects are noted under a category, the defect shall be described and the\nofficial grader will determine the extent to which it should be allowed. The\nmelt test shall be done in the following manner: (i) Apparatus. (a) Balance scale of 500 gram capacity\nsensitive to 50 mg. plus or minus. (b) Oven capable of heating to 550 degrees\n\nFahrenheit uniformly over the entire surface. (c) Pizza tray of appropriate size. (d) Household type shredder. (e) Table fork. (ii)\n\nIngredients. (a) Heavy concentrated tomato puree (11.3\npercent to 15 percent of natural tomato soluble solids). (b) Pizza shell, 1/4\" minimum thickness, premade, store bought, slightly baked. May be frozen. (c) Shredded low moisture cheese. (iii)\n\nProcedure. (a) Preheat oven to 500 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. (b) Prepare pizza using\nthe following amounts or exact proportions thereof: (1)\n\nEvenly spread four oz. pizza sauce over\n12 inch diameter 1/4 thick shell. Leave 1/2\" around edge of shell. (2)\n\nEvenly distribute 70 grams of shredded\nmozzarella over 1/2 of the 12\" diameter shell. A second sample may be used on\nthe other half of shell. (3)\n\nPlace\nprepared pizza in the preheated oven at 500 degrees Fahrenheit for eight to ten\nminutes. If using frozen shell, unthaw and bake one to two minutes\nlonger. (c) Remove pizza\nfrom oven, wait one minute and then insert tip of table fork into the cheese, lift vertically to determine length of stretch. (d) Observe for free fat, color, blistering\nor burn and degree of coverage. (b) Flavor. (1)\n\nVery slight. Barely detectable upon\ncritical examination. (2)\n\nSlight. Detected only upon critical examination. (3)\n\nDefinite. Not intense but\ndetectable. (4)\n\nPronounced. So\nintense as to be easily identified. (5)\n\nFeed. Feed flavors (such as alfalfa, sweet clover, silage or similar feed) in milk carried through into the\ncheese. (6)\n\nAcid. May be slight if\ncheese is aged over one week. Sharp and puckery to the taste, characteristics\nof lactic acid. (7)\n\nBitter. Distasteful, similar to taste of quinine. May be present in cheese one week or\nmore old. (8)\n\nFruity. A sweet\nfruit-like flavoring resembling apples; generally increasing in intensity as\nthe cheese ages. Acceptable in cheese one week or more in age. (9)\n\nFlat. Insipid, lacking in flavor\ndevelopment, devoid of flavor. Present most likely if cheese is less than one\nweek old. (10)\n\nCooked. Mildly\nsuggestive of uncleanliness in addition to a whey taint. (11)\n\nMetallic/oxidized. Flat, metal-like\ntaste and puckery sensation. (12)\n\nRancid. Characterized by: (i) a slow reaction\ntime; (ii)\nits prominence after the\nsample is expectorated; and\n(iii)\nits persistence. The flavor is bitter; soapy, very disagreeable and\nrepulsive. (13)\n\nYeasty. Identified by its sour, yeasty taste and slightly fragrant\nodor. (c) Body and\ntexture. (1)\n\nSmooth. Feels silky; not dry and\ncoarse or rough. (2)\n\nFirm. Feels\nsolid and offers slight resistance to pressure. The rind will be somewhat\nfirmer than the interior of the cheese. (3)\n\nOpen. Mechanical openings that are\nirregular in shape and are caused by workmanship and not gas\nfermentation. (4)\n\nWeak. Requires\nlittle pressure to crush, is soft but is not necessarily sticky like a pasty\ncheese. (5)\n\nPasty. Usually weak\nbody and when the cheese is rubbed between the thumb and fingers it becomes\nsticky and smeary. (6)\n\nGassy. Gas\nholes of various sizes and may be scattered. (7)\n\nSlits.
