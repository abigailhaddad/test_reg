  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 361.6 - Differential supervision\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Differential supervision for conditional releasees. (1)\n\nEach department shall classify its adult\nsupervision caseload into three categories based upon a conditional releasee's\nlikelihood of successful completion of conditional release. The classification\ncategories of supervision will be three levels: level I--intensive; level\nII--medium; and level III-- minimum, as follows: (i) Level I--intensive. (a) Cases shall be assigned to this level of\nsupervision in accordance with the classification score established by the\n\nState Director of Probation and Correctional Alternatives. Notwithstanding, where a conditional releasee receives less than the required classification\nscore but in the best mutual judgment of the probation officer and his\nsupervisor presents a substantial likelihood of failure on release, the\nconditional releasee may be classified as level I. The reason for such\nclassification shall be recorded in the official case record. (b) Required contacts. (1)\n\nThe probation officer shall make one home\nvisit per month and at least four personal contacts per month, one of which may\ntake place during a home visit. (2)\n\nThe probation officer shall make at least 12 collateral contacts per quarter. However, in the event the probation officer has ample justification to reduce\nthe number of collateral contacts, he may, with the approval of his immediate\nsupervisor, reduce the number of collateral contacts which may not be fewer\nthan three per quarter. Justification for and approval of any reduction shall\nbe recorded in the official case record. (ii)\n\nLevel II--medium. (a) Cases shall be assigned to this level of\nsupervision in accordance with the classification score established by the\n\nState Director of Probation and Correctional Alternatives. Notwithstanding, where a conditional releasee receives less than the required classification\nscore but in the best mutual judgment of the probation officer and his\nsupervisor presents a significant likelihood of failure on release, he may be\nclassified as level II. The reason for such classification shall be recorded in\nthe official case record. (b) Required contacts. (1)\n\nThe probation officer\nshall make at least two personal contacts per month. (2)\n\nThe probation officer shall make at least\ntwo collateral contacts per quarter. (iii)\n\nLevel III--minimum. (a) Cases shall be assigned to this level of\nsupervision in accordance with the classification score established by the\n\nState Director of Probation and Correctional Alternatives. (b) Cases shall be further assigned to this\nlevel of supervision as a result of their specific technical or dispositional\nstatus as follows: (1)\nabsconders; and\n(2)\ncases in which interstate\ntransfer processing has not been completed; or\n(3)\ndual supervision cases. (c) Required contacts. (1)\n\nThe probation officer shall make at least\none contact per month with the conditional releasee unless the conditional\nreleasee has absconded or has been rearrested and confined to a correctional\nfacility. Where a releasee is presently confined in a correctional facility the\nprobation officer shall maintain monthly liaison with the detaining authorities\nand wherever possible shall visit or contact the releasee periodically during\nhis detention. (2)\n\nThe probation\nofficer shall make at least one collateral contact per quarter. (d) Contact requirements. (1)\n\nAbsconders, interstate, and dual\nsupervision cases may be carried out by auxiliary personnel under the general\ndirection of a probation officer. (2)\n\nCases may require more frequent contacts\nthan those specified in a given level. Therefore, probation supervisors shall\nensure that the duty of supervision is carried out by probation officers and\nadditional contacts made accordingly. (3)\n\nThe level of supervision for any case may\nbe revised by utilization of a reclassification process as prescribed by the\n\nState Director of Probation and Correctional Alternatives. However, any case\nassigned to level I shall remain in said classification category for as minimum\nperiod of 90 days from the date of entry before reclassification. Absconder, interstate, and dual supervision cases may be reclassified without the\nutilization of the reclassification process. Classification of each conditional\nreleasee shall be reviewed quarterly by the probation officer and\nsupervisor. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n361.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
