(1)\nA claimant must obtain\ndiagnostic examinations and tests through a diagnostic testing network when: (i) the insurance carrier responsible for\nclaimant's claim has contracted with a diagnostic testing network that is in\ncompliance with Workers' Compensation Law section 13-a(7) and this Subpart and\nrequires claimant to obtain or undergo diagnostic examinations and tests with\nan affiliated network provider; and\n(ii)\nthe insurance carrier responsible for\nthe claimant's claim has provided the notification required in paragraph (d)(1)\nof this section. (2)\n\nThe\nrequirement to obtain or undergo diagnostic examinations or tests through a\ndiagnostic testing network applies regardless of the cost of the diagnostic\nexaminations or tests. (b) Use of diagnostic testing network not\nrequired. (1)\nA claimant may use a facility\nor provider that is not affiliated with the diagnostic testing network or\nnetworks if all within a reasonable distance are unable to schedule the\ndiagnostic examinations and tests ordered by the treating provider and as\nprescribed herein, or when the insurance carrier has filed or will be filing a\nnotice of controversy with the board controverting the claim pursuant to\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law section 25(2) and as described at section\n325-7.4\n(b)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. If the claim is subsequently established by the board, then the\ninsurance carrier will be liable for the cost of the diagnostic examinations\nand tests performed relating to the work-related injury at the workers'\ncompensation fee schedule rate. However, if the claim is not established by the\nboard, then the insurance carrier will not be liable for the cost of any\ndiagnostic examinations and tests performed. In such event, liability reverts\nto the claimant pursuant to section\n325-1.23\nof this Part. (2)\nA claimant shall not be required to\nobtain or undergo diagnostic examinations and tests from an affiliated network\nprovider: (i) prior to being provided with\nthe notice required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or\n(ii)\nin the event of a medical emergency as\ndefined in section\n325-7.1\n(k) of\nthis Subpart; or\n(iii)\nwhen the\ndiagnostic testing network does not have a provider or facility within a\nreasonable distance from the claimant's residence or place of employment as\ndefined in section\n325-7.1\n(n) of\nthis Subpart; or\n(iv)\nthe\ndiagnostic testing network does not have a provider or facility within a\nreasonable distance from the claimant's residence or place of employment that\ncan perform the diagnostic examinations and tests within five days as required\nby section\n325-7.3\n(i) of\nthis Subpart. (c) Medical treatment guidelines. All\ndiagnostic examinations and tests, for body parts for which a medical treatment\nguideline has been adopted, shall be performed in compliance with the\napplicable medical treatment guideline for that body part. If an affiliated\nnetwork provider, or to the extent permitted by law a diagnostic testing\nnetwork, requests confirmation or approval from the insurance carrier that the\ndiagnostic examinations and tests are consistent with the medical treatment\nguidelines, the insurance carrier shall respond to such request promptly so\nthat the diagnostic testing network can schedule and have the examinations and\ntests performed within five days as required by section\n325-7.3\n(i) of\nthis Subpart, unless the claimant or treating health care provider requests a\nspecific location that can be accommodated by the diagnostic testing\nnetwork. (d) Notice. (1)\n\nAn insurance carrier that requires\nclaimants to utilize a diagnostic testing network to obtain or undergo\ndiagnostic examinations and tests shall include in its notice a statement that\nan insurance carrier's failure to comply with the notice requirements relieves\nthe claimant of his or her obligation to use a diagnostic testing network for\nany necessary diagnostic examinations and tests.

(2)\n\nWhile the insurance carrier may delegate responsibility for providing the\nnotice required by this subdivision to the diagnostic testing network or an\naffiliated network provider with which it contracts, or another agent or\ncontractor, the insurance carriers remain responsible for providing the notice\nand shall be liable if it is not provided in accordance with this\n\nSubpart.

(4)\n\nIf the insurance carrier complies with\nthe notice requirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, but the claimant\nutilizes the services of a facility or provider, including the treating medical\nprovider, that is not an affiliated network provider for diagnostic\nexaminations and tests, then the insurance carrier is not liable for the cost\nof the diagnostic examinations and tests. (5)\n\nIf an insurance carrier fails to comply\nwith the notification requirements of this subdivision, it may be subject to\nsanction by the chair or his or her designee. Such sanction may include a\ndirection that payment for the diagnostic examinations and tests, when\nperformed by facility or medical provider that is not an affiliated network\nprovider, be at the workers' compensation fee schedule rate, in addition to the\ncosts incurred by the harmed party due to such failure. In cases of persistent\nand significant non-compliance, such sanction may include suspension or\nprohibition of the use of a diagnostic testing network or networks pursuant to\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law section 13-a(7) and this Subpart. In addition, the\nchair in his or her discretion may prohibit the use of a diagnostic testing\nnetwork operating in violation of any law or regulation. (e) Reports. (1)\n\nReports shall be prepared for all\ndiagnostic examinations and tests performed by affiliated network providers on\nbehalf of insurance carriers. (2)\n\nAffiliated network providers shall submit full and truthful reports of the\nimpressions and medical findings of all diagnostic examinations and tests to\nthe claimant's treating medical provider who requested the diagnostic\nexaminations and tests. Said reports must also be filed with the board and sent\nto all parties of interest on the same day. (3)\n\nReports of all results, impressions, and/or findings of diagnostic examinations and tests shall be sent to the\nclaimant's treating medical provider who requested such diagnostic examinations\nand tests and the board immediately upon completion of the report detailing the\nresults, impressions, and/or findings but no more than three business days\nafter such examination or test has been performed, except in the case of EMG\nand NCS studies which shall be sent to the claimant's treating medical provider\nand the board no more than seven business days after such study has been\nperformed. The report detailing the results of such diagnostic examinations and\ntests may be sent electronically to the treating medical provider who requested\nsuch examination or test, as long as such provider agrees to such electronic\ntransmission and it complies with all State and Federal privacy laws. (f) Test film or data. When\nrequested in writing, the actual film or test data that provides the basis for\nthe results, impressions, and medical findings in the report of the diagnostic\nexaminations and tests shall be delivered to the claimant's treating medical\nprovider who requested the diagnostic examinations and tests at the same time\nthe report is submitted or, if requested after the report has been sent, within\nthree business days of receipt of the written request. A second diagnostic\nexamination or test may be ordered from the diagnostic testing network due to\ninadequate quality and for the purpose of obtaining an accurate diagnosis as\nset forth in the medical treatment guidelines. (g) Choice of facility or provider. (1)\n\nWhen a claimant is required to obtain or\nundergo diagnostic examinations and tests from an affiliated network provider, he or she has the right to choose the facility or provider that will perform\nthe diagnostic examinations and tests from among all affiliated network\nproviders available in the insurance carrier's diagnostic testing network or\nnetworks. Claimant always has the right to consult with the treating medical\nprovider who ordered the diagnostic examinations and tests when choosing the\naffiliated network provider. (2)\n\nThe carrier, or diagnostic testing network on its behalf, shall provide\nclaimant with a list of affiliated network providers to choose from to perform\nthe diagnostic examinations and tests. (h) Relationship between claimant and\nprovider. A limited patient-provider relationship is established as a result of\nconducting diagnostic examinations and tests in accordance with Workers'\nCompensation Law section 13-a(7) and this Subpart. The limited patient-provider\nrelationship requires the provider to conduct objective diagnostic examinations\nand tests but not to monitor claimants' work related injury or illness over\ntime, treat claimants, or fulfill the other duties traditionally held by\ntreating providers. However, all laws and regulations governing the\nconfidentiality of medical records and workers' compensation records shall\napply to the records and reports of a diagnostic testing network and the\naffiliated network providers.
