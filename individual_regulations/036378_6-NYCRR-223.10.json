  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 223.10 - Component leakage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner or\noperator of a petroleum refinery subject to this Part shall: (1)\n\nDevelop a monitoring program consistent\nwith provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (2)\n\nConduct a monitoring program consistent\nwith the provisions of subdivision (d) of this section. (3)\n\nRecord all leaking components which have\na volatile organic compound concentration exceeding 10,000 ppm when tested\naccording to the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section, and place an\nidentifying tag on each component consistent with the provisions of paragraph\n(d)(7) of this section. (4)\n\nIf the\nleak can be repaired without a shutdown, repair and retest the leaking\ncomponent as soon as possible but not later than 15 working days after the leak\nis found. (5)\n\nIf the leak cannot be\nrepaired without a shutdown, identify all leaking components which cannot be\nrepaired until the unit is shutdown for turnaround. (6)\n\nThe commissioner may require the\nrescheduling of a planned unit turnaround to an earlier date based on the\nnumber and severity of tagged leaks awaiting turnaround. Before requiring a\nrescheduled turnaround, the commissioner will consider the effect of the action\non supplies of gasoline and heating oil, the availability of necessary repair\nequipment, and time requirements for contracting outside labor and rescheduling\nfacility personnel. (7)\n\nExcept for\nsafety pressure relief valves, no owner or operator of a petroleum refinery\nshall install or operate a valve at the end of a pipe or line containing\nvolatile organic compounds unless the pipe or line is sealed with a second\nvalve, a blind flange, a plug or a cap. The sealing device may be removed only\nwhen a sample is being taken or during maintenance operations. (8)\n\nPipeline valves and pressure relief\nvalves in gas service for any volatile organic compound shall be marked in some\nmanner that will be readily obvious to both refinery personnel performing\nmonitoring and the commissioner. (b) The owner or operator of a petroleum\nrefinery shall meet the following schedule: (1)\nsubmit to the commissioner and commence a\nmonitoring program six months after the effective date of this Part. This\nprogram shall contain, as a minimum, a list of the refinery units and the\nquarter in which they will be monitored, a copy of the log book format, and the\nmake and model of the monitoring equipment to be used. In no case shall a\nmonitoring contract relieve the owner or operator of a petroleum refinery of\nthe responsibility for compliance with this Part; and\n(2)\nsubmit the first quarterly monitoring\nreport to the commissioner six months after the approval of the monitoring\nprogram. (c) Testing and\ncalibration procedures to determine compliance with this Part must be\nconsistent with Appendix B of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\nguideline series document, \"Control of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks from\n\nPetroleum Refinery Equipment\", EPA-450/2-78-036. (d) The owner or operator of a petroleum\nrefinery subject to this Part must: (1)\n\nMonitor yearly by the methods referenced in subdivision (c) of this section, all pump seals, pipeline valves in liquid services, and process drains in\ngaseous or light petroleum compound service. (2)\n\nMonitor quarterly by the methods\nreferenced in subdivision (c) of this section, all compressor seals, pipeline\nvalves in gaseous service and pressure relief valves in gas service. (3)\n\nMonitor weekly by visual methods all pump\nseals in pumps in gaseous or light petroleum compound service. (4)\n\nMonitor immediately any pump seal in\npumps handling gases and light petroleum compounds from which liquids are\nobserved dripping. (5)\n\nVisually\nmonitor any relief valve within 24 hours after it has vented to the\natmosphere. (6)\n\nMonitor within 72\nhours after repair, any component that was found leaking. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator of a petroleum\nrefinery, upon the detection of a leaking component, will affix a weatherproof\nand readily visible tag, bearing an identification number and the date the leak\nis located, to the leaking component. This tag must remain in place until the\nleaking component is repaired. (e) The owner or operator of a petroleum\nrefinery shall maintain a leaking components monitoring log specified in\nparagraph (a)(3) of this section, which shall contain at a minimum, the\nfollowing data: (1)\nthe name of the process\nunit where the component is located; (2)\nthe type of component (e.g., valve, seal); (3)\nthe tag number of the\ncomponent; (4)\nthe date on which a\nleaking component is discovered; (5)\nthe date on which a leaking component is\nrepaired; (6)\nthe date and\ninstrument reading of the recheck procedure after a leaking component is\nrepaired; (7)\na record of the\ncalibration of the monitoring instrument; (8)\nthose leaks that cannot be repaired until\nturnaround; (9)\nthe total number of\ncomponents checked and the total number of components found leaking; and\n(10)\ncopies of the monitoring\nlog shall be retained by the owner or operator for a minimum of two years after\nthe date on which the record was made or the report prepared, and shall be made\navailable immediately to the commissioner or his representative, upon verbal or\nwritten request, at any reasonable time. (f) Reporting. The owner or operator of a\npetroleum refinery, upon the completion of each yearly and/or quarterly\nmonitoring procedure, shall: (1)\nsubmit a\nreport to the commissioner by the 15th day of January, April, July and October\nthat lists all leaking components that were located during the previous three\ncalendar months but not repaired within 15 days, all leaking components\nawaiting unit turnaround, the total number of components inspected and the\ntotal number of components found leaking; and\n(2)\nsubmit a signed statement with the report\nattesting to the fact that, with the exception of those leaking components\nlisted in paragraph (1) of this subdivision all monitoring and repairs were\nperformed as stipulated in the monitoring program. (g) If the owner or operator of a petroleum\nrefinery can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the\nrequirements of subdivisions (d), (e) and (f) of this section are not feasible, the commissioner may allow the application of alternative\nrequirements.
