(h) Occurrence\nmeans an\naccident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which\nresults in a release from an underground storage tank. This definition is\nintended to assist in the understanding of these regulations and is not\nintended either to limit the meaning of \"occurrence\" in a way that conflicts\nwith standard insurance usage or to prevent the use of other standard insurance\nterms in place of \"occurrence.\"\n(i) Petroleum marketing facilities\ninclude all facilities at which\npetroleum is produced or refined and all facilities from which petroleum is\nsold or transferred to other petroleum marketers or to the public. (j) Property damage\nmeans\ninjury to real or personal property through another's negligence willful\ndestruction, or by some act of nature.

A guarantee contract is issued\n\"incident to that relationship\" if it arises from a clear commonality of\ninterest in the event of a UST release such as coterminous boundaries, overlapping constituencies, common groundwater aquifer, or other relationship\nother than monetary compensation that provides a motivation for the guarantor\nto provide a guarantee. (m) Tangible net worth\nmeans the tangible assets that remain after\ndeducting liabilities; such assets do not include intangibles such as goodwill\nand rights to patents or royalties.
