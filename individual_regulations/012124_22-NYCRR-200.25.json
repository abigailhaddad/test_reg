  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 200.25 - Procedure for accepting guilty pleas by mail in the New York City Criminal Court\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Establishment. The Administrative\n\nJudge of the New York City Criminal Court may establish a procedure for\naccepting guilty pleas by mail whereby a defendant charged in an information\nwith a designated petty offense defined outside of the Penal Law may enter a\nplea of guilty to such petty offense, and be sentenced by the court to pay a\nfine and any applicable surcharge on the resulting conviction, without making a\npersonal appearance in the action. For purposes of this section, the term petty\noffense shall have the same meaning as in subdivision (39) of section\n1.20\nof\nthe Criminal Procedure Law. (b) Applicability. The procedure\nestablished pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section shall apply only where\na defendant has been served with an appearance ticket in lieu of an arrest, returnable in the summons part of the New York City Criminal Court, for a petty\noffense defined outside of the Penal Law that has been specifically designated\nby the Administrative Judge of the New York City Criminal Court as appropriate\nfor disposition under this section. (c) Appearance ticket; form and content. (1)\n\nThe appearance ticket shall\nbe in a form prescribed by the Administrative Judge of the New York City\n\nCriminal Court, in consultation with appropriate criminal justice agencies, and\nshall be served upon the defendant by the issuing officer. The appearance\nticket shall contain the nature of the charge, the range of applicable\npenalties if convicted of the charge, a procedure for pleading guilty by mail, and such other information as may be prescribed by the administrative\njudge. (2)\n\nWith\nrespect to the procedure for the entry of a plea of guilty by mail, the\nappearance ticket shall contain the exact amount of the fine and surcharge to\nbe imposed by the court, and the manner in which and date by which such fine\nand surcharge must be paid. The appearance ticket also shall include a\nprovision advising the defendant that, by entering a plea of guilty by mail to\nthe charge, he or she: (i) waives arraignment in open court, the right to receive a copy of the accusatory\ninstrument and the right to the aid of counsel; (ii)\npleads guilty to the offense as\ncharged; (iii)\nunderstands that a plea of guilty to the charge is equivalent to a conviction\nafter trial; (iv)\nagrees that the charge be disposed of by payment of the fine and any applicable\nsurcharge in accordance with the amounts designated in the appearance ticket; and\n(v) understands\nthat the court may refuse to accept the plea of guilty, because of the\ndefendant's prior criminal record or other special circumstance, in which case, if ultimately convicted, he or she may be sentenced to the full range of\npenalties set forth in the appearance ticket. (d) Procedure. A defendant\nserved with an appearance ticket pursuant to this section charging the\ndefendant with a designated petty offense defined outside of the Penal Law may\nenter a plea of guilty by mail by indicating, in accordance with the\ninstructions in the appearance ticket, that he or she pleads guilty to the\ncharge, and by signing and mailing the completed ticket, by first class, registered or certified mail, to the court at the address provided on the\nticket, together with payment of the amount of the fine and surcharge set forth\non the ticket for the offense charged. Provided an information has been filed\ncharging such offense, the court then may dispose of the case as though the\ndefendant had been convicted upon a plea of guilty in open court, or, because\nof the defendant's prior criminal record or other special circumstance, may\nrefuse to accept the plea of guilty. If the plea is so refused, the court shall\ninform the defendant in writing that he or she is required to appear before the\ncourt at a stated time and place to answer the charge, which shall thereafter\nbe disposed of pursuant to the applicable provisions of law, and shall return\nto the defendant any fine or surcharge payment that may have accompanied the\ndefendant's proffered plea of guilty. Where an information charging a\ndesignated petty offense is dismissed by the court, any plea of guilty to such\noffense entered pursuant to this section shall be refused, and the court shall\ninform the defendant of the fact of the dismissal and shall return to the\ndefendant any fine or surcharge payment that may have accompanied the\ndefendant's proffered plea of guilty. A plea of guilty to a designated petty\noffense that is refused pursuant to this section shall be deemed a\nnullity. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
