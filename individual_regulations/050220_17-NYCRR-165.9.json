  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 165.9 - Load posting\n\nState Regulations\nA bridge must be posted for a restricted load limit when a\nload rating analysis and/or posting evaluation, as required by the AASHTO\nManual and this code, indicates that a bridge does not have sufficient live\nload capacity to safely carry full legal traffic loads. A safe load level for a\nbridge is calculated by ascertaining the limits defined by the inventory and\noperating load rating levels and using the operating load rating as the upper\nlimit. However, in no case shall loads be allowed on a bridge which exceed the\nbridge's operating rating capacity. (a) Load posting requirements. No bridge\nshall be posted for a load less than three tons. In the event that a bridge's\noperating rating is less than three tons, the bridge must be closed to all\nvehicular traffic. (b) Load posting\nsigning requirements. Load posting signing shall be in conformance with the New\n\nYork State Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n165.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
