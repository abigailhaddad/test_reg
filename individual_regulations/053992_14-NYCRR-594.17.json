  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 594.17 - Determination of capacity of self-preservation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The evacuation capacity of residents is a\nfunction of both the ability of the residents to evacuate and the assistance\nprovided by staff. Determination of satisfactory ability to evacuate should be\nmade prior to admission to a housing program. Such a determination may be\nreached by review of the applicant's history and a face-to-face interview which\nshows a capacity to evacuate equivalent to that of the general public. When\nuncertainty exists a time drill may be used for a more objective\nmeasurement. (b) Subsequent to\nadmission, a program of timed drills should be used to regularly evaluate the\nlevel of evacuation capability of program residents. Translation of drill times\nto evacuation capability may be determined as (1) three minutes or less, prompt; (2) over three minutes but not in excess of 13 minutes, slow. Evacuation capability is based on the time of day or night when evacuation of\nthe facility would be the most difficult (i.e., sleeping residents or fewer\nstaff present). Residents needing assistance in evacuating should be assisted\nby staff to the extent that assistance would be available at the time of day or\nnight in an actual emergency. (c) Fire exit drills shall be conducted at least monthly. Some drills may be\nannounced in advance to the residents. The drills shall involve the actual\nevacuation of all residents to an assembly point as specified in the emergency\nplan and shall provide residents with experience in exiting through all exits. Actual exiting from windows shall not be necessary to meet the requirements of\nthis section. Opening the window and signaling for help shall be an acceptable\nalternative. Records should indicate the time to evacuate, date and times of\nday, location of simulated fire origin, the escape paths used and comments\nrelating to residents who did not evacuate within the required time. (d) Residents and prospective residents shall\nonly reside in or be admitted to a type of housing program appropriate to the\nyouths' evacuation capability. (1)\n\nIf a\nresident or prospective resident is clearly capable of prompt evacuation, that\nyouth may be admitted to or remain in any housing program of a type appropriate\nto his or her functional level. (2)\n\nIf a resident fails to demonstrate a capability for prompt evacuation during a\nfire drill, the matter should be completely documented in the fire drill log\nand in the resident's record. Immediate steps should be taken to relocate the\nresident to a location within the residence which will allow for easier egress\nfor such time as is necessary until another fire drill can be conducted (no\nmore than 14 days) and the resident's behavior observed again. (3)\n\nIf any resident or prospective resident\nwould be excluded from a housing program because of inability to evacuate\nwithin the time limits above, an evaluation shall be conducted as described in\nthe most current recognized edition of the National Fire Protection Association\n101A, Alternative Approaches to Life Safety. Said codes are published by the\n\nNational Fire Protection Association, One Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269\nand are available for review at the Department of State, Division of\n\nAdministrative Rules, One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY\n12231 and the Office of Mental Health, Bureau of Inspection and Certification, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY 12229. If the resultant E-score yields an\nevacuation difficulty level of prompt, the applicant or resident shall not be\nexcluded for failure to evacuate within the required time limit. If the\nresultant E-score yields an evacuation difficulty level of slow, the applicant\nor resident shall not be excluded solely for failure to evacuate within the\nrequired time frame from a facility that is constructed to meet the slow\nevacuator standards of the current recognized edition of the Life Safety\n\nCode. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n594.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
