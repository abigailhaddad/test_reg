Such amount shall not exceed one tenth of one percent of the total certified cost of the hospital. The commissioner shall inform each such hospital of its actual fee to support the statewide planning and research cooperative system and each hospital shall submit such fee on a quarterly basis to be received by the commissioner not later than the 15th of February, May, August and November of each year. Failure to submit such fees in accordance with this schedule may result in a two-percent reduction in the affected hospital's rate beginning on the first day following the due date and continuing until the last day of the calendar month in which said fees are submitted. These funds shall be pooled on a statewide basis and will be restricted and used to support the costs of the statewide planning and research cooperative systems. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
