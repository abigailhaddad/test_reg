Regulated institutions are not limited to offering the types\nof relief listed above. Regulated institutions are encouraged, consistent with\nsafe and sound banking practices, to take additional reasonable and prudent\nactions to assist individuals demonstrating financial hardship as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in any manner they deem appropriate. (c) As soon as reasonably\npracticable, and in no event not later than 10 business days following the\npromulgation of this regulation, all regulated institutions shall e-mail, publish on their website, mass mail, or otherwise similarly broadly communicate\nto customers how to apply for COVID-19 relief and provide their contact\ninformation. (d) Qualifications to receive COVID-19 relief. (1)\n\nThe criteria developed by regulated\ninstitutions for individuals to qualify for COVID-19 relief shall be clear, easy to understand, and reasonably tailored to the requirements of the\nregulated institution to assess whether it will provide, consistent with the\ngoals of Executive Order 202.9 and this regulation, applicable State and\n\nFederal law, and the principles of safe and sound business practices, COVID-19\nrelief. (2)\n\nIf a regulated\ninstitution receives an application for COVID-19 relief that omits any\ninformation that the institution reasonably needs to process the application, the institution shall promptly communicate to the applicant the nature of the\nmissing information and how it can be provided to the institution. (e) Processing applications\nfor COVID-19 relief.

(f) Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order\n202.9, section\n39\nof the Banking\n\nLaw was modified to provide that it shall be an unsafe and unsound business\npractice if, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, any regulated institution\nshall not grant a forbearance of any payment due on a residential mortgage for\na period of 90 days to any individual who has applied for such a forbearance\nand demonstrated a financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as\ndescribed herein. In assessing whether a regulated institution has engaged in\nan unsafe or unsound practice by denying an application for such a forbearance, the department will consider the adequacy of the process established by the\nregulated institution to process such forbearance applications, the\nthoroughness of the review afforded to the application, the payment history, creditworthiness, and the financial resources of the borrower, the application\nof any State and Federal laws or regulations that would prohibit the grant of a\nforbearance, as well as the safety and soundness requirements of the regulated\ninstitution. (g) During\nexaminations, the department's examiners will not criticize in their\nexaminations prudent and reasonable efforts to grant forbearance of any payment\ndue on a residential mortgage pursuant to this regulation and consistent with\nsafe and sound practices. (h) Regulated institutions are directed to maintain copies of all files relating to\ntheir implementation of this regulation for a period of seven years from the\ndate of creation and to make such files available for inspection at the\ndepartment's next examination of the regulated institution.
