Such notice shall: (1)\nspecify the date, time and place of the hearing; (2)\nstate briefly the issues which are to be the subject of the hearing; (3)\nexplain the manner in which the fair hearing will be conducted; (4)\napprise the petitioner of its right to be represented by an attorney, to testify, present documentary evidence, produce witnesses, cross-examine adverse witnesses, and to examine prior to and during the hearing the documents and records supporting the action under appeal; and\n(5)\nstate that failure to appear at the hearing shall constitute waiver of the petitioner's right to a hearing and that an order will be issued denying or disqualifying the petitioner from participation in the WIC program. (e) The administrative law judge, in rendering a decision on the food vendor's application for participation in the WIC program shall be bound by section 60- 1.13 of this Subpart. (f) Under this section, the burden of proof to participate or remain in the WIC program shall be on the local agency or vendor denied participation or disqualified for violations of the vendor's contract with the local agency or of this Subpart.

(i) Following a hearing denying a vendor participation in the WIC program for lack of need, neither the local agency nor the department shall accept from a vendor, for at least one year from the date of the order denying participation, an application to participate in the WIC program. In cases of vendor abuse, neither the local agency nor the department shall accept an application for the period of disqualification up to a maximum of three years from the date of vendor's disqualification.

The disqualification may not be stayed during the pendency of the hearing by the administrative law judge without the consent of the department's representative at the hearing. The disqualification shall remain in effect unless an order is issued at the conclusion of the hearing which reinstates the vendor or local agency. (k) This section shall not preclude the department from commencing a subsequent proceeding to assess a civil penalty against the vendor or the local agency pursuant to section\n60-1.11\nof this Subpart. (l) This section shall not preclude the department from ordering a WIC vendor to immediately cease and desist from depositing WIC checks in the bank.
