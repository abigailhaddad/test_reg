The\nentire acreage of any one specific foundation single cross grown by and/or\nbelonging to one applicant must be eligible and be inspected. Any field or\nportion of a field failing to meet requirements must be so disposed of that it\ncannot be used for seed purposes. (2)\n\nIsolation requirement. A production field\nof a specific foundation single cross involving male sterile material must be\nso located that it is not less than 40 rods from any other kind of corn. In\ncase of normal single cross seed production fields, the following exceptions\nwill apply: (i) Adequate natural barriers for\nmodifying isolation distances; and\n(ii)\n\nDifferential maturity dates may permit\nmodifying isolation distances, provided that there are no receptive silks in\nthe ear parent at the time pollen is being shed in the contaminating\nfield. (3)\n\nDetasseling. The following requirements apply only when 5.0 per cent or more of the ear\nparent plants have apparently receptive silks: (i) A foundation single cross will not be\naccepted for certification if on any one inspection more than 1.0 per cent of\nthe ear parent plants have shed pollen, or on any three inspections on\ndifferent dates exceeds 2.0 per cent; (ii)\n\nWhen more than one combination is being\ngrown in the same isolation and the ear parent of one or more of them is\nshedding pollen in excess of 1.0 per cent, all ear parents having five per cent\nor more apparently receptive silks at that time will be disqualified unless\nadequately isolated from the shedding ear parent; (iii)\n\nSucker tassels, portions of tassels on\nmain plants will be counted as shedding pollen when two inches or more of the\ncentral stem, the side branches or a combination of the two have the anthers\nextended from the glumes. (b) Specific requirements. (1)\n\nAn isolation in which more than 0.1 per\ncent definitely offtype, or more than 1.0 per cent, doubtful-type plants in the\npollen parent have shed pollen, will not be certified. (2)\n\nAt the time of the last inspection the\near parent shall not contain in excess of 0.1 per cent definitely offtype or\n1.0 per cent doubtful-type plants. (3)\n\nAny plant shedding pollen in the male\nsterile rows must be completely destroyed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n104.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
