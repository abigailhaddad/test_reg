HTST\nPasteurization\nOPERATION OF HTST SYSTEMS\nHTST pasteurization has become important to the dairy industry\nbecause of the operating efficiencies which it affords. Properly operated, these units allow high volume of production in a minimum of processing\nspace. The ability of HTST pasteurizers to assure a safe, finished\nproduct hinges on the reliability of the time-temperature-pressure\nrelationships which must prevail whenever the system is in operation. It is\nimportant that the plant operator understand the HTST process in order to\nmaintain proper surveillance over the equipment. The basic flow pattern is\ndescribed below: 1. Cold raw milk, in\na constant level supply tank, is drawn into the regenerator section of the HTST\npasteurizer. Note: --Some operators prefer to bypass the regenerator when\nstarting. Under this system, cold milk is drawn directly through the timing\npump (step 3) and into the heater section. The remaining steps are performed\nwithout exception. This bypass arrangement facilitates and speeds up the\nstarting operation. After forward flow is established at the flow-diversion\ndevice, the bypass, which may be manually or automatically controlled, is not\nused and the raw milk flows through the regenerator. A second start-up\ntechnique involves the use of sanitizer solution at 170° F (77° C). This is\npassed through the complete unit and followed immediately by milk. Dilution of\nthe first milk does occur, however, and care must be taken to prevent this from\nbeing packaged. 2. In the\nregenerator section, the cold raw milk is warmed by hot pasteurized milk\nflowing in a counter current direction on the opposite sides of thin stainless\nsteel surfaces. 3. The raw milk, still under suction, passes through a positive displacement timing pump which\ndelivers it under pressure through the rest of the HTST pasteurization\nsystem. 4. The raw milk is pumped\nthrough the heater section where hot water or steam on opposite sides of thin\nstainless steel surfaces heats the milk to a temperature of at least 161° F\n(72° C). 5. The milk, at\npasteurization temperature, and under pressure, flows through the holding tube\nwhere it is held for at least 15 seconds. (The maximum velocity of the milk\nthrough the holding tube is governed by the speed of the timing pump, the\ndiameter and length of the holding tube and surface friction.). 6. After passing the sensing bulbs of an\nindicating thermometer and a recorder/controller, the milk passes into the\nflow-diversion device which automatically assumes a forward-flow position if\nthe milk passes the recorder/controller bulb at the preset cut-in temperature\n(i.e. 161° F (72° C) or higher). The valve automatically assumes the\ndiverted-flow position if the milk passes the recorder/controller bulb below\nthe preset cut-out temperature (i.e. 161° F (72° C)). 7. Improperly heated milk flows through the\ndiverted-flow line back to the raw milk constant level supply tank\n8. Properly heated milk flows through the\nforward-flow line to the pasteurized milk regenerator section where it serves\nto warm the cold raw milk and, in turn, is cooled. 9. The warm milk passes through the cooling\nsection, where coolant, on the sides of thin stainless steel surfaces opposite\nthe pasteurized milk, reduces its temperature to 40° F (4° C) and\nbelow. 10. The cold pasteurized\nmilk then passes to a storage tank or vat to await\npackaging. HTST PASTEURIZERS EMPLOYING MILK-TO-MILK REGENERATORS WITH BOTH\nSIDES CLOSED TO THE ATMOSPHERE\nItem 16p(C) establishes standards for regenerators. These\nstandards insure that the raw milk will always be under less pressure than\npasteurized milk in order to prevent contamination of the pasteurized milk in\nthe event. flaws should develop in the metal or joints separating it from the\nraw milk. An explanation of regenerator specifications is given below. Image\n\nDuring normal operation (i.e., while the timing pump is\noperating), raw milk will be drawn through the regenerator at subatmospheric\npressure. The pasteurized milk in the milk-to-milk regenerator will be above\natmospheric pressure. The required pressure differential will be assured when\nthere is no flow-promoting device downstream from the pasteurized milk side of\nthe regenerator to draw the pasteurized milk through the regenerator, and the\npasteurized milk downstream from the regenerator rises to at least a 1-foot\nelevation above the highest raw milk level downstream from the constant-level\ntank, and is open to the atmosphere at this or a higher elevation, as required\nin Item 16p(C)2. During a shutdown (i.e., when the timing pump stops), the raw\nmilk in the regenerator will be retained under suction, except as this suction\nmay be gradually relieved by possible entrance of air drawn through the\nregenerator plate gaskets from the higher outside atmospheric pressure. With a\nfree draining regenerator, as required under Item 16p(C)7, the raw milk level\nin the regenerator may drop slowly, depending on the tightness of the gaskets, ultimately falling below the level of the plates to the product level in the\nraw milk supply tank. However, under these conditions, as long as any raw milk\nremains in the regenerator, it will be at subatmospheric pressure. During shutdown, the pasteurized milk in the regenerator is\nmaintained at atmospheric pressure or above by meeting the elevation\nrequirement of Item 16p(C)2. Pressure greater than atmospheric is maintained\nwhen the level of pasteurized milk is at or above the required elevation; loss\nof pressure due to suction is prevented by prohibiting a downstream\npump. Image\n\nAny backflow of milk through the flow-diversion device would\nlower the pasteurized milk level during pump shutdowns, thus tending to reduce\nthe pressure on the pasteurized milk side of the regenerator. A flow-diversion\nvalve cannot be relied upon to prevent backflow in such instances, because\nduring the first few minutes following a pump shutdown, the milk is still at a\nsufficiently high temperature to keep the diversion valve in the forward-flow\nposition. Compliance with the provisions of Item 16p(C)2 and 3, however, will\ninsure a proper pressure differential in the regenerator. At the beginning of a run, from the time raw milk or water is\ndrawn through the regenerator, until the pasteurized milk or water has risen to\nthe elevation specified in Item 16p(C)2, the pasteurized milk side of the\nregenerator is at atmospheric pressure or higher. Even if the metering pump\nshould stop during this period, the pressure on the pasteurized milk side of\nthe regenerator will be greater than the subatmospheric pressure on the raw\nmilk side, assured by compliance with Item 16p(C)2 and 3, as long as any raw\nmilk remains in the regenerator. When a raw milk booster pump is incorporated into the HTST\nsystem, Item 16p(C)5 requires, in part, that automatic means shall be provided\nto assure, at all times, the required pressure differential between raw and\npasteurized milk in the regenerator before the booster pump can operate. The\nmost common control employed to accomplish this is a sanitary pressure switch\ninstalled at or downstream from the pasteurized milk outlet of the regenerator. The pressure switch is adjusted to energize the booster pump only after the\npasteurized milk pressure in the regenerator exceeds, by at least 1 pound per\nsquare inch, the maximum operating pressure developed by the booster\npump. Image\n\nThe setting and checking of the pressure switch used to control\nthe proper operation of the raw milk booster pump is described in Appendix 4, Test 9,1. As an alternative control to the use of the pressure switch, the adjustable time delay relay in conjunction with a hydrostatic head, has\nbeen effectively used in HTST systems equipped with raw milk booster pumps of\nrelatively low capacity. Such time delay relay provides a predetermined time\nlapse between the moment the flow-diversion device assumes the forward-flow\nposition and the moment the booster pump is energized. The time lapse required\nis that necessary for the forward flow of milk through the regenerator and\ncooler to rise to a height sufficiently above the booster pump outlet to\nprovide a pressure at least one pound greater than the maximum pressure\ndeveloped by the booster pump. The pasteurized milk pipeline is vented to the\natmosphere at or above the necessary vertical rise. The setting and checking of the time delay relay and\nhydrostatic head used to control the proper operation of the raw milk booster\npump is described in Appendix 4, Test 9,2. Image\n\nImage\nII.

Disposable media filters shall consist of cotton flannel, wool\nflannel, spun metal, nonwoven fabric U.S.P absorbent cotton fiber, or suitable\ninorganic materials which, under conditions of use, are nontoxic and\nnonshedding. Chemical bonding material contained in the media shall be\nnontoxic, nonvolatile, and insoluble under all conditions of use. Disposable\nmedia shall not be cleaned and reused. Filter Performance.--The efficiency of intake filters shall be\nat least 50 percent as measured by the National Bureau of Standards' \"Dust Spot\n\nMethod\"a using atmospheric dust as the lest aerosol. The efficiency of either air pipeline filters or disposable\nfilters shall be at least 50 percent as measured by the DOP (Dioctyl\n1-phthalate fog)b test. Piping.--Air distribution piping, fittings, and gaskets between\nthe terminal filter and any product or product-contact surface shall be\nsanitary milk piping, except where the compressing equipment is of the fan or\nblower type. When the air is used for such operations as removing containers\nfrom mandrels, other nontoxic materials may be used. FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION\nAir Supply Equipment. --The compressing equipment shall be\ndesigned to preclude contamination of the air with lubricant vapors and fumes. Oil-free air may be produced by one of the following methods or their\nequivalent: 1. Use of a carbon ring\npiston compressor. 2. Use of\noil-lubricated compressor with effective provision for removal of any oil vapor\nby cooling the compressed air. 3. Water-lubricated or nonlubricated blowers. The air supply shall be taken from a clean space or from\nrelatively clean outer air and shall pass through a filter upstream from the\ncompressing equipment. This filter shall be located and constructed so that it\nis easily accessible for examination, and the filter media are easily removable\nfor cleaning or replacing. The filter shall be protected from weather, drainage, water, product spillage, and physical damage. Moisture Removal Equipment.--If it is necessary to cool the\ncompressed air, an aftercooler shall be installed between the compressor and\nthe air storage tank for the purpose of removing moisture from the compressed\nair. Filters and Moisture Traps. --Filters shall be constructed so\nas to assure effective passage of air through the filter media only. The air under pressure shall pass through an oil-free filter\nand moisture trap for removal of solids and liquids. The filter and trap shall\nbe located in the air pipeline downstream from the compressing equipment and\nfrom the air tank, if one is used. Air pipeline filters and moisture traps\ndownstream from compressing equipment shall not be required where the\ncompressing equipment is of the fan or blower type. A disposable media filter shall be located in the sanitary air\npipelines upstream from and as close as possible, to each point of application\nor ultimate use of the air. Air Piping. --The air piping from the compressing equipment to\nthe filter and moisture trap shall be readily drainable. A product-check valve of sanitary design shall be installed in\nthe air piping downstream from the disposable media filter to prevent backflow\nof product into the air pipeline, except that a check valve shall not be\nrequired if the air piping enters the product zone from a point higher than the\nproduct overflow level which is open to the atmosphere. The requirements of this section do not apply when the\ncompressing equipment is of the fan or blower type. See illustrations depicting\nvarious air supply systems. Note--For additional details, see 3-A Accepted Practices for\n\nSupplying Air Under Pressure in Contact With Milk, Milk Products, and\n\nProduct-Contact Surfaces.

Culinary\n\nSteam--Milk and Milk Products\n\nThe following methods and procedures will provide steam of\nculinary quality for use in the processing of milk and milk products. SOURCE OF BOILER FEED WATER\nPotable water or water supplies acceptable to the regulatory\nagency shall be used. FEED WATER TREATMENT\nFeed waters may be treated, if necessary, for proper boiler\ncare and operation. Boiler feed water treatment and control shall be under the\nsupervision of trained personnel or a firm specializing in industrial water\nconditioning. Such personnel shall be informed that the steam is to be used for\nculinary purposes. Pretreatment of feed waters for boilers or steam generating\nsystems to reduce water hardness, before entering the boiler or steam generator\nby ion exchange or other acceptable procedures, is preferable to addition of\nconditioning compounds to boiler waters. Only compounds complying with\n\nSection\n173.310\nof Title 21 of the Code of Federal\n\nRegulations may be used to prevent corrosion and scale in\nboilers or to facilitate sludge removal. Greater amounts shall not be used of the boiler water treatment\ncompounds than the minimum necessary for controlling boiler scale or other\nboiler water treatment purposes. No greater amount of steam shall be used for\nthe treatment and/or pasteurization of milk and milk products than\nnecessary. It should be noted that tannin, which is also frequently added\nto boiler water to facilitate sludge removal during boiler blow-down, has been\nreported to give rise to odor problems, and should be used with caution. Boiler compounds containing cyclohexylamine, morpholine, octadecylamine, diethylaminoethanol, trisodium nitrilotriacetate, and hydrazine\nshall not be permitted for use in steam in contact with milk and milk\nproducts. BOILER OPERATION\nA supply of clean, dry saturated steam is necessary for proper\nequipment operation; boilers and steam generation equipment shall be operated\nin such a manner as to prevent foaming, priming, carryover, and excessive\nentrainment of boiler water into the steam. Carryover of boiler water additives\ncan result in the production of milk off-flavors. Manufacturers' instructions\nregarding recommended water level and blow-down should be consulted and\nrigorously followed. The blow-down of the boiler should be carefully watched, so that an overconcentration of the boiler water solids and foaming is avoided. It is recommended that periodic analyses be made of condensate samples. Such\nsamples should be taken from the line between the final steam separating\nequipment and the point of the introduction of steam into the product. PIPING ASSEMBLIES\nSuggested piping assemblies for steam infusion or injection are\nshown on Figure 29. Other assemblies which will assure a clean, dry saturated steam\nare acceptable.
