  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 375-4.8 - Remedial program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nrestoration investigation project includes the remedial investigation, the\nalternatives analysis report and the department record of decision. The\nmunicipality must implement the department-approved remedial investigation work\nplan, and any revisions thereto. (b) The goal of the program for a specific\nsite is to select a remedy that is protective of public health and the\nenvironment, including, but not limited to, groundwater according to its\nclassification pursuant to ECL 17-0301, drinking water, surface water and air\n(including indoor air), sensitive populations, including children and\necological resources, including fish and wildlife. At a minimum, the remedy\nselected shall eliminate or mitigate all significant threats to the public\nhealth and to the environment presented by contaminants disposed at the site\nthrough the proper application of scientific and engineering\nprinciples. (c) Application of the\nsoil cleanup objectives. (1)\n\nThe remedial\nprogram for soils at a site must utilize soil cleanup objectives that are\nprotective of public health and the environment. The remedial party, subject to\ndepartment approval, may: (i) utilize the\nsoil cleanup objectives, as set forth in section\n375-6.8\nof this Part; (ii)\ndevelop or modification of site specific\nsoil cleanup objectives, as set forth in section\n375-6.9\nof this Part; or\n(iii)\npropose site-specific soil cleanup\nobjectives which are protective of public health and the environment. (2)\n\nThe soil component of the\nremedial program will consider the soil cleanup objectives for unrestricted\nuse, as set forth in Table 375-6.8(a) of this Part, as representative of\npre-disposal conditions for remedial programs proceeding as set forth in\nsubparagraph (1)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision, unless an impact to ecological\nresources has been identified. (3)\n\nCleanup objectives for other media. The threat to public health and the\nenvironment resulting from contamination in all other environmental media shall\nbe: (i) evaluated in the development of\nremedial alternatives in the alternatives analysis to ensure that the remedial\nprogram meets the requirements of this section and section\n375-1.8\nof this Part. (d) Alternative\nanalysis. (1)\n\nAn alternatives analysis shall\nbe conducted by the municipality that develops and evaluates, using the factors\nset forth in section\n375-1.8\n(f) of this\n\nPart, alternatives for all contaminated media identified by the remedial\ninvestigation of the site. (2)\n\nWhere soil contamination above the unrestricted soil cleanup objectives is\nidentified by the remedial investigation, the alternatives analysis: (i) shall develop and evaluate one or more\nalternatives that achieve the unrestricted soil cleanup objectives; and\n(ii)\nmay evaluate one or more\nalternatives that achieve a restricted use of the site which may be proposed by\nthe municipality. Where a restricted use is proposed in the alternatives\nanalysis, the municipality shall: (a) develop\nand evaluate alternatives, to achieve the restricted use proposed by the\nmunicipality; and\n(b) develop and\nevaluate other alternatives, if directed by the department, which will achieve\nthe same use or a less restricted use of the site than that proposed by the\nmunicipality. (3)\n\nThe department may approve a remedial\nprogram for soil that: (i) utilizes different\nsoil cleanup objectives between different areas of a site, provided such areas\ncan be defined and described in the environmental easement and the necessary\ninstitutional and engineering controls can be effectively imposed, implemented, operated, monitored and maintained in accordance with the department-approved\nsite management plan; (ii)\nconsiders site specific background concentrations or the location of a site in\nareas of historic fill in the development of the remedy; or\n(iii)\nachieves a cleanup which is more\nstringent than the current, intended and reasonably anticipated future land\nuses of the site and its surroundings. (4)\n\nThe department shall select the remedy\nfor the site from: (i) the alternatives\ndeveloped and evaluated by the alternatives analysis; or\n(ii)\nan alternative or alternatives developed\nby the department in addition to those presented by the alternatives\nanalysis. (e) Remedy selection. The process of selecting a remedy shall be consistent with\nthe requirements of section\n375-1.8\n(f) of this\n\nPart and shall be documented in a record of decision, which includes the\ninformation identified below: (1)\n\nThe\nlocation and description of the site. (2)\nA history of the operation of the\nsite. (3)\n\nThe current environmental\nand public health status of the site. (4)\n\nAn enforcement history of the\nsite. (5)\n\nThe specific goals and\nobjectives of the remedy selected for the site. (6)\nA description and evaluation of the\nalternatives considered, except in the case of no further action\nremedies. (7)\nA summary of the\nbasis for the department's decision. (8)\nA description of the selected remedy, including the site management requirements and an identification of any\nnecessary institutional and engineering controls. (9)\nA list of the documents the department\nused in its decisionmaking. (10)\nA\nresponsiveness summary. (f) Remediation. An environmental restoration\nremediation project includes the design and implementation of the remedial\naction for the site that the department selected in the record of\ndecision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n375-4.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
