  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 221.5 - Declaration of quantity; consumer packages\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The International System of\n\nUnits (SI) known as the metric system and units of the customary system of\nweights and measures are jointly recognized, and units of either one of these\nsystems may be used in a declaration of quantity. However, customary\nequivalents to metric sizes must be presented on commodities until such time as\nthe Federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act is amended and the commissioner\ndeems the consumer is adequately prepared for the sole use of metric\ndeclarations. (b) Largest whole\nunit. Where this regulation requires that the quantity declaration be in terms\nof the largest whole unit, the declaration shall, with respect to a particular\npackage, be in terms of the largest whole unit of weight or measure, with any\nremainder expressed in: (1)\ncommon or decimal\nfractions of such largest whole unit; or\n(2)\nthe next smaller whole unit, or units, with any further remainder in terms of common or decimal fractions of the\nsmallest unit present in the quantity declaration. (c) Net quantity. The principal display panel\nof a package shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of the commodity in\nthe package, exclusive of wrappers and any other material packed with such\ncommodity. (d) Use of \"net mass\" or\n\"net weight\". A quantity declaration may stand alone or may include the term\n\"net mass\" or \"net weight\" either preceding or following the declaration. The\nterm \"net\" by itself may be used on food labels. However, the quantity of\ncontents shall always declare the net quantity of contents even when such terms\nare not used. (e) Lines or print or\ntype. A declaration of quantity may appear on more than one line of print or\ntype. (f) Terms--weight, liquid\nmeasure or count. The declaration of the quantity of a particular commodity\nshall be expressed in terms of liquid measure, if the commodity is liquid, or\nin terms of weight, if the commodity is solid, semisolid, viscous, or a mixture\nof solid and liquid, or in terms of numerical count. However, if there exists a\nfirmly established general consumer usage and trade custom with respect to the\nterms used in expressing a declaration of quantity of a particular commodity, such declaration of quantity may be expressed in its traditional terms, if such\ntraditional declaration gives accurate and adequate information as to the\nquantity of the commodity. (g) Combination declaration. (1)\n\nWeight. A\ndeclaration of quantity in terms of weight shall be combined with appropriate\ndeclarations of the measure, count and size of the individual units unless a\ndeclaration of weight alone is fully informative. (2)\n\nMeasure. A declaration of quantity in\nterms of measure shall be combined with appropriate declarations of the weight, count and size of the individual units unless a declaration of measure alone is\nfully informative. (3)\n\nCount. A\ndeclaration of quantity in terms of count shall be combined with appropriate\ndeclarations of the weight, measure and size of the individual units unless a\ndeclaration of count alone is fully informative. (h) Metric units--weight, measure. A\ndeclaration of quantity: (1)\nin units of\nweight shall be in terms of the kilogram, gram or milligram; (2)\nin units of liquid measure shall be in\nterms of the liter or milliliter, and shall express the volume at 20 degrees C, except in the case of petroleum products, for which the declaration shall\nexpress the volume at 15 degrees C, and except also in the case of a commodity\nthat is normally sold and consumed while frozen, for which the declaration\nshall express the volume at the frozen temperature, and except also in the case\nof a commodity that is normally sold in the refrigerated state, for which the\ndeclaration shall express the volume at 4 degrees C; (3)\nin units of linear measure shall be in\nterm of the meter, centimeter, or millimeter; (4)\nin units of area measure shall be in\nterms of the square meter or square centimeter; (5)\nin units of volume, other than liquid\nmeasure, shall be in terms of the liter and milliliter, except that the terms\ncubic meter and cubic centimeter will be used only when specifically designated\nas a method of sale. (i) Symbols. (1)\n\nAny of the following symbols for\nmetric units, and none other, may be employed in the quantity statement on a\npackage of commodity: meter\nm\ncentimeter\ncm\nmillimeter\nmm\nsquare meter\nm\n2\nsquare centimeter\ncm\n2\ncubic meter\nm\n3\ncubic centimeter\ncm\n3\nliter\nL\nmilliliter\nmL\ngram\ng\nkilogram\nkg\nmilligram\nmg\n(2)\n\nSymbols, except for liter, are not capitalized unless the unit is derived from\na proper name. Periods should not be used after the symbol. Symbols are always\nwritten in the singular form--do not add \"s\" to express the plural when the\nsymbol is used. (j) Customary units--weight, measure. A declaration of quantity: (1)\nin units of weight shall be in terms of\nthe avoirdupois pounds or ounces; except, that solder and brazing alloys\ncontaining precious metals when packaged and labeled for retail sale are\nexempted hereunder, provided, the net quantity declaration is stated in terms\nof the troy pound and ounce and the term \"Troy\" is used in each\ndeclaration; (2)\nin units of liquid\nmeasure shall be in terms of the United States gallon of 231 cubic inches or\nliquid-quart, liquid-pint or fluid ounce subdivisions of the gallon, and shall\nexpress the volume at 68° F, except in the case of petroleum products, for\nwhich the declaration shall express the volume at 60° F, and except also in the\ncase of a commodity that is normally sold and consumed while frozen, for which\nthe declaration shall express the volume at the frozen temperature and except\nalso in the case of a commodity that is normally sold in the refrigerated\nstate, for which the declaration shall express the volume at 40° F; (3)\nin units of linear measure shall be in\nterms of the yard, foot or inch; (4)\nin units of area measure shall be in\nterms of the square yard, square foot or square inch; (5)\nin units of dry measure shall be in terms\nof the United States bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches or peck, dry quart, and\ndry pint subdivisions of the bushel; (6)\nin units of cubic measure shall be in\nterms of the cubic yard, cubic foot, or cubic inch. (k) Symbols and abbreviations. (1)\n\nAny of the following symbols and\ncustomary units, and none other, shall be employed in the quantity statement on\na package of commodity: avoirdupois\navdp\ncubic\ncu\nfeet or foot\nft\nfluid\nfl\ngallon\ngal\ninch\nin\nliquid\nliq\nounce\noz\npint\npt\npound\nlb\nquart\nqt\nsquare\nsq\nweight\nwt\nyard\nyd\n(2)\n\nThere normally are no periods following, nor plural forms of, symbols and\nabbreviations. For example, \"oz\" is the symbol for both ounce and ounces. Both\nupper and lower case letters are acceptable. (l) Units with two or more meanings. When the\nterm \"ounce\" is employed in a declaration of liquid quantity, the declaration\nshall identify the particular meaning of the term by the use of the term\n\"fluid\"; however, such distinction may be omitted when, by association of terms\n(for example, as in \"1 pint 4 ounces\"), the proper meaning is obvious. Whenever\nthe declaration of quantity is in terms of the dry pint or dry quart, the\ndeclaration shall include the word \"dry\". (m) Prescribed units--metric system. (1)\n\nLess than one meter, one square meter, one kilogram, or one liter. The declaration of quantity shall be expressed in\nterms of: (i) in the case of length measure\nof less than one meter, centimeters and decimal fractions of a centimeter, but\nif less than one centimeter, then in millimeters; (ii)\nin the case of area measure of less than\none square meter, square centimeters and decimal fractions of square\ncentimeters; (iii)\nin the case of\nweight of less than one kilogram, grams and decimal fractions of a gram, but if\nless than one gram, then in milligrams; (iv)\nin the case of fluid or dry measure of\nless than one liter, milliliters. Provided, that the quantity declaration\nappearing on a random package may be expressed in terms of decimal fractions of\nthe largest appropriate unit, the fraction being carried out to not more than\nthree decimal places. (2)\n\nOne meter, one square meter, one\nkilogram, one liter or more. In the case of: (i) length measure of one meter or more; in\nmeters and decimal fractions to not more than three places; (ii)\narea measure of one square meter or\nmore; in square meters and decimal fractions to not more than three\nplaces; (iii)\nweight of one\nkilogram or more; in kilograms and decimal fractions to not more than three\nplaces; (iv)\nfluid or dry measures\nof one liter or more; in liters and decimal fractions to not more than three\nplaces. (3)\n\nBidimensional\ncommodities. For bidimensional commodities (including roll-type commodities)\nthe quantity declaration shall be expressed: (i) if less than one square meter, in terms\nof cm2, followed in parentheses by a declaration of length and width in\ncentimeters and decimal fractions; (ii)\nif one square meter or more, in terms of\nsquare meters followed in parentheses by a declaration of both length and\nwidth, each being in terms of the meter and decimal fractions of a meter; provided, that: (a) no square meter\ndeclaration is required for a bidimensional commodity of 10 centimeters width\nor less, but the length and width shall be expressed in centimeters; (b) a dimension of less than one meter may be\nstated in centimeters within the parenthetical; (c) commodities consisting of usable\nindividual units (except roll-type commodities with individual usable units\ncreated by perforations, for which see subdivision [o] of this section) require\na declaration of unit area but not a declaration of total area of all such\nunits; and\n(d) no declaration in\nsquare units is required for commodities for which the length and width\nmeasurements are critical in terms of end use (such as tablecloths or\nbedsheets) if such commodities clearly present the length and width\nmeasurements on the label. (n) Prescribed units--customary system. (1)\n\nLess than one foot, one square foot, one\npound, or one pint. The declaration of quantity shall be expressed in terms of: (i) in the case of length measure of less\nthan a foot, inches and fractions of inches; (ii)\nin the case of area measure of less than\none square foot, square inches and fractions of square inches; (iii)\nin the case of weight of less than one\npound, ounces and fraction of ounces; (iv)\nin the case of fluid measure of less\nthan one pint, fluid ounces and fractions of fluid ounces. Provided, that the quantity declaration appearing on a random\npackage may be expressed in terms of decimal fractions of the largest\nappropriate unit, the fraction being carried out to not more than three decimal\nplaces. (2)\n\nOne\nfoot, one square foot, one pound, one pint, one gallon, or more. The\ndeclaration of quantity shall be expressed in the following terms: (i) length measure of one foot or more, the\ndeclaration of quantity shall be expressed in terms of feet or yards with any\nremainder expressed in inches and fractions of the inch or in fractions of the\nfoot or yard, except that it shall be optional to include a statement of length\nin terms of inches; (ii)\narea\nmeasure of one square foot or more but less than four square feet, expressed in\nsquare feet with any remainder expressed in square inches and fractions of a\nsquare inch or in fractions of a square foot; or\n(iii)\narea measure of four square feet or\nmore, expressed in square yards or square feet with any remainder in expressed\nin square inches and fractions of a square inch or in fractions of the square\nfoot or square yard; (iv)\nweight of\none pound or more expressed in terms of the largest whole unit with any\nremainder expressed in ounces and fractions of an ounce or in fractions of the\npound; (v) fluid measure of one pint\nor more but less than one gallon, expressed in quarts, quarts and pints, or\npints with any remainder expressed in fluid ounces or fractions of the pint or\nquart, except that two quart may be declared as one-half gallon; or\n(vi)\nfluid measure of one gallon or more, expressed in terms of gallons followed by fractions of a gallon or by the next\nsmaller whole unit with any remainder expressed in fluid ounces or fractions of\nthe pint or quart; (vii)\ndry measure\nof one dry pint or more, expressed in terms of the largest whole unit with the\nremainder expressed in fractions of a dry pint, dry quart, peck, or bushel, provided the quantity declaration on a random package may be expressed in\ndecimal fractions of the largest appropriate unit carried out to no more than\nthree decimal places. (3)\n\nBidimensional commodities. For bidimensional commodities (including roll-type\ncommodities) the quantity declaration shall be expressed: (i) if less than one square foot, in terms of\nlinear inches and fractions of linear inches; (ii)\nif at least one square foot, but less\nthan four square feet, in terms of square inches followed in parentheses by a\ndeclaration of both the length and width, each being in terms of the largest\nwhole unit; provided, that: (a) no square\ninch declaration is required for a bidimensional commodity of four inches width\nor less; (b) a dimension of less\nthan two feet may be stated in inches within the parenthetical declaration; and\n(c) commodities consisting of\nusable individual units (except roll-type commodities with individual usable\nunits created by perforations, for which see subdivision [o] of this section)\nrequire a declaration of unit area but not a declaration of total area of all\nsuch units; (iii)\n\nIf\nfour square feet or more, in terms of square feet followed in parentheses by a\ndeclaration of the length and width in terms of the largest whole units; provided, that: (a) no declaration in square\nfeet is required for a bidimensional commodity with a width of four inches or\nless; (b) bidimensional\ncommodities, with a width of four inches or less, shall have the length\nexpressed in inches followed by a statement in parentheses of the length in the\nlargest whole unit; (c) a dimension\nof less than two feet may be stated in inches within the parenthetical\ndeclaration; and\n(d) no declaration\nin square units is required for commodities for which the length and width\nmeasurements are critical in terms of end use (such as tablecloths or\nbedsheets) if such commodities clearly present the length and width\nmeasurements on the label. (o) Count; ply. (1)\n\nIf the commodity is in individually\nusable units of one or more components or ply, the quantity declaration shall, in addition to complying with other applicable quantity declaration\nrequirements of this Part, include the number of ply and total number of usable\nunits. (2)\n\nRoll-type commodities, when perforated so as to identify individual usable units, shall not be deemed\nto be made up of usable units; however, such roll-type commodities shall be\nlabeled in terms of: (i) total area\nmeasurement; (ii)\nnumber of\nply; (iii)\ncount of usable units; and\n(iv)\ndimensions of a single\nusable unit. (p) Fractions. (1)\n\nMetric. A metric statement in a\ndeclaration of net quantity of contents of any consumer commodity may contain\nonly decimal fractions. (2)\n\nCustomary. A customary statement in a declaration of net quantity of contents\nof any consumer commodity may contain common or decimal fractions. A common\nfraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eights, sixteenths, or\nthirty-seconds, except that: (i) if there\nexists a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of\nemploying different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a\nparticular commodity, they may be employed; and\n(ii)\nif linear measurements are required in\nterms of yards or feet, common fractions may be in terms of thirds. (3)\n\nCommon fractions. A common\nfraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms. (4)\n\nDecimal fractions. A decimal fraction\nshall not be carried out to more than three places. (q) Conversion of units. In all conversions\nfor the purpose of showing an equivalent metric or customary quantity, the\nnumber of significant digits retained should be such that accuracy is neither\nsacrificed nor exaggerated. (r) Supplementary declarations. (1)\n\nSupplementary\nquantity declarations. The required quantity declaration may be supplemented by\none or more declarations of weight, measure, or count, such declaration\nappearing other than on a principal display panel. Such supplemental statement\nof quantity of contents shall not include any terms qualifying a unit of\nweight, measure, or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of commodity\ncontained in the package (e.g., \"giant\" quart, \"larger\" liter, \"full\" gallon, \"when packed\", \"minimum\", or words of similar import). (2)\n\nCombined metric and customary\ndeclarations. An equivalent statement of the net quantity of contents in terms\nof either the customary or metric systems is not regarded as a supplemental\nstatement and such statement may also appear on the principal display panel; provided, that it conforms to both subdivision (h) and subdivision (m) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nQualification of\ndeclaration prohibited. In no case shall any declaration of quantity be\nqualified by the addition of the words \"when packed\", \"minimum\", or \"not less\nthan\", or any words of similar import, nor shall any unit of weight, measure, or count be qualified by any term (such as \"jumbo\", \"giant\", \"full\", or the\nlike) that tends to exaggerate the amount of commodity. (s) Character of declaration; average. The\naverage net quantity of contents in the packages of a particular lot, shipment, or delivery shall at least equal the declared net quantity and no unreasonable\nshortage in any package shall be permitted, even though overages in other\npackages in the same shipment, delivery, or lot compensate for such\nshortage.
