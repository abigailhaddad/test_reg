  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 4212.6 - Business terms for project loans, collateral deposits and grants\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No project loan\nin an amount greater than $1 million will be considered. Security arrangements\nwill be established on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the type of\nloan and the particular characteristics of a project. Most project loans will\nbe secured by fixed assets. Personal and corporate guarantees of payment and\ncompletion also may be required as the corporation deems appropriate. (b) Written commitments from other funding\nsources necessary for completion of the project will be required before\ndisbursement by the corporation of the project loan or project collateral\ndeposit proceeds. Approved construction loans will not be funded before secure\ncommitments for financing all construction costs and for permanent financing\nhave been obtained. (c) Interest\nrates on project loans will be set at the time the corporation's directors\napprove an application. Interest rates and repayment schedules will reflect\nmarket conditions, the applicant's ability to repay, job creation incentives\nand other project requirements. (d) The standard maturities for project loans generally will be as follows: (1)\nproject loans for which the proceeds are\nused to acquire or improve real estate generally will be made for a term not to\nexceed 20 years or the useful life of the project, whichever is less; (2)\nproject loans for which the proceeds are\nused to acquire or improve machinery and equipment generally will be made for a\nterm of from three to seven years, or the useful life of the collateral, whichever is less; and\n(3)\nproject\nloans for construction generally will not exceed 24 months, plus a period to be\ndetermined by the corporation as a maximum delay attributable to force\nmajeure. (e) Standard\nrepayment terms generally will include level debt service payments over the\nterm of the project loan. Deferred or graduated payments may be permitted in\nspecific, appropriate instances (which shall be determined in light of such\nfactors as the project's debt servicing capability, the relative importance of\nthe project's public purpose and the likely economic and sociological\nconsequences of a failure to permit deferred or graduated payments), provided\nthat the project loan will be fully amortized over the remainder of the loan\nterm. (f) No project collateral\ndeposit in an amount less than $100,000 or greater than $1 million will be\nconsidered. Interest earned on such deposit will accrue, and shall be\nperiodically paid, to the corporation. No more than 90 percent of the principal\namount of a bank loan shall be secured by a project collateral deposit. Loan\ndocuments securing the bank loan shall be collaterally assigned to the\ncorporation. The interest rate charged to the borrower of any bank loan secured\nby a project collateral deposit shall be below the prevailing interest rate\nordinarily set by the bank loan lender. The collateral and underwriting terms\nfor a bank loan secured by a project collateral deposit shall be acceptable to\nthe corporation. (g) The corporation\npolicy is to encourage the creation of new employment opportunities for poor\nand chronically unemployed residents of the State. Recipients of project loans\nof $100,000 or more or bank loans secured by project collateral deposits, that\nare expected to create 50 or more new jobs over a three-year period, will be\nencouraged to consider, for new employment opportunities generated as a result\nof the project, individuals on public assistance and those eligible for\nbenefits under the provisions of the Job Training Partnership Act ( 29 USC\n1501\net seq.). (h) The corporation policy\nis to require employers that receive significant assistance from the State to\nagree to provide notification of plant closing or major layoffs. Recipients of\nproject loans of $100,000 or more or bank loans secured by project collateral\ndeposits, that are expected to have an employment level of 50 or more persons\nat the project site within one year of the disbursement of such loan, will be\nencouraged to give a minimum of 90 days' notice to its employees and the\ncorporation prior to the reduction of its permanent work force over a one-year\nperiod by the greater of (1) 50 employees, or (2) 50 percent of its work\nforce. (i) Recipients of project\nloans in an amount equal to or greater than $100,000, for a term of three years\nor more and who are expected to employ 50 or more permanent employees by a\nprojected employment date, will be encouraged to agree to comply with the\ncorporation's interest rate adjustment policy. That corporate policy provides\nthat, in the event such recipient's work force falls short of the projected\nwork force on the projected employment date by a percentage of 15 percent or\nmore, then the interest rate for the project loan shall be increased to a rate\nequal to two percent above the prevailing prime interest rate at the time of\nthe increase. Interest rate adjustments, if any, will be made on an annual\nbasis. (j) Project grants shall be\nmade from available program funds on a matching basis, except that the matching\nrequirement shall be reduced or eliminated on a case-by-case basis where the\napplicant demonstrates to the UDC's satisfaction that the applicant was\nunsuccessful, after diligent effort, in its attempt to secure such matching\nfunds. (k) If the corporation later\napproves a hard cost loan for a facility which was the subject of a study which\nreceived program grant assistance, then the corporation may convert the program\ngrant to a loan, to be made in accordance with the terms of the hard cost\nloan.
