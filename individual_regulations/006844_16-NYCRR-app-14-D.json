Steel, cast iron, and ductile iron structures. A negative (cathodic voltage of at least 0.85 volt, with\nreference to a saturated copper- copper sulfate half cell. Determination of\nthis voltage must be made with the protective current applied, and in\naccordance with sections II and IV of this Appendix. A negative (cathodic) voltage shift of at least 300 millivolts. Determination of this voltage shift must be made with the protective current\napplied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this Appendix. The\ncriterion of voltage shift applies to structures not in contact with metals of\ndifferent anodic potentials. A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100\nmillivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in accordance\nwith sections III and IV of this Appendix. A voltage at least as negative (cathodic as that originally\nestablished at the beginning of the Tafel segments of the E-log-I curve. This\nvoltage must be measured in accordance with section IV of this Appendix. A net protective current from the electrolyte into the\nstructure surface as measured by an earth current technique applied at\npredetermined current discharge (anodic) points of the structure. Aluminum structures. Except as provided in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this\nparagraph, a minimum negative (cathodic voltage shift of 150 millivolts, produced by the application of protective current. The voltage shift must be\ndetermined in accordance with sections II and IV of this Appendix. Except as provided in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this\nparagraph, a minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100\nmillivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in accordance\nwith sections III and IV of this Appendix. Notwithstanding the alternative minimum criteria in\nsubparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, aluminum, if cathodically\nprotected at voltages in excess of 1.20 volts as measured with reference to a\ncopper-copper sulfate half cell, in accordance with section IV of this\n\nAppendix, and compensated for the voltage (IR) drops other than those across\nthe structure-electrolyte boundary may suffer corrosion resulting from the\nbuild-up of alkali on the metal surface. A voltage in excess of 1.20 volts may\nnot be used unless previous test results indicate no appreciable corrosion will\noccur in the particular environment. Since aluminum may suffer from corrosion under high pH\nconditions, and since application of cathodic protection tends to increase the\npH at the metal surface, careful investigation or testing must be made before\napplying cathodic protection to stop pitting attack on aluminum structures in\nenvironments with a natural pH in excess of 8. Copper structures. A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization\nvoltage shift of 100 millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be\ndetermined in accordance with sections III and IV of this Appendix. Metals of different anodic potentials. A negative (cathodic)\nvoltage, measured in accordance with section IV of this Appendix, equal to that\nrequired for the most anodic metal in the system must be maintained. If\namphoteric structures are involved that could be damaged by high alkalinity\ncovered by subparagraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph B of this section, they must\nbe electrically isolated with insulating flanges or the equivalent. II. Interpretation of voltage\nmeasurement. Voltage (IR) drops other than those across the\nstructure-electrolyte boundary must be considered for valid interpretation of\nthe voltage measurement in paragraphs A(1) and (2) and paragraph B(1) of\nsection I of this Appendix. III. Determination of a polarization voltage shift. The polarization voltage shift\nmust be determined by interrupting the protective current and measuring the\npolarization decay. When the current is initially interrupted, an immediate\nvoltage shift occurs. The voltage reading after the immediate shift must be\nused as the base reading from which to measure polarization decay in paragraphs\nA(3), B(2), and C of section I of this Appendix. IV. Reference half cells. Except as provided in paragraphs B and C of this section, negative (cathodic) voltage must be measured between the structure surface and\na saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell contacting the electrolyte. Other standard reference half cells may be substituted for the\nsaturated copper-copper sulfate half cell. Two commonly used reference half\ncells are listed below along with their voltage equivalent to -0.85 volt as\nreferred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell: Saturated KCl calomel half cell: -0.78 vol. Silver-silver chloride half cell used in sea water: -0.80\nvolt. In addition to the standard reference half cells, an alternate\nmetallic material or structure may be used in place of the saturated\ncopper-copper sulfate half cell if its potential stability is assured and if\nits voltage equivalent referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell\nis established. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app\n14-D\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
