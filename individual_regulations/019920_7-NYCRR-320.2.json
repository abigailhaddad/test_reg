Tit. 7 § 320.2 - Residential Mental Health Unit\n\nState Regulations\nA residential mental health unit (RMHU) is a program that\nincludes a separate housing location within a correctional facility designed to\naddress the corrections-based therapeutic treatment of incarcerated individuals\ncurrently diagnosed with a serious mental illness who, due to their behavior, are serving a confinement sanction.

All incarcerated individuals will be offered four hours\nof structured out-of-cell therapeutic programming and/or mental health\ntreatment along with three hours out-of-cell congregate programming, services, treatment, recreation, activities, and/or meals, with an additional one hour of\nrecreation, for a total of seven hours out-of-cell on a daily\nbasis.
