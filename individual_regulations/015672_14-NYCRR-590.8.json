Retention in an extended observation bed shall not exceed 72\nhours, which shall be calculated from the time such person is initially\nreceived into the emergency room of the comprehensive psychiatric emergency\nprogram. (4)\n\nNo person may be\ninvoluntarily retained in a comprehensive psychiatric emergency program for\nmore than 24 hours unless the person is admitted to an extended observation bed\nin accordance with section 9.40 of the Mental Hygiene Law. (5)\n\nAny person with a need of medical or\nsurgical care or treatment which cannot be provided in the comprehensive\npsychiatric emergency program, shall not remain in the comprehensive\npsychiatric emergency program for a period exceeding eight hours.

(e) Information gathering for comprehensive\nand effective care. (1)\n\nThe program shall\naccess the Psychiatric Services and Clinical Knowledge Enhancement System\n(PSYCKES) or other available electronic health records or database(s) to\nidentify the individual's treatment providers and prior medication use and/or\ntreatment engagement history. (2)\n\nThe program shall document efforts to identify and contact with the\nindividual's consent, the individual's treatment team and other relevant\nproviders (e.g., housing providers, care coordination, managed care\norganizations), and collaterals. In accordance with HIPAA and section 33.13 of\nthe Mental Hygiene Law, the program shall attempt to obtain the authorization\nof the individual or someone authorized to make health care decisions on the\nindividual's behalf to access, use and disclose personal health information\nfrom collaterals or other data sources as outlined in this subdivision. If the\nauthorization of the individual cannot practicably be obtained due to\nincapacity or emergency circumstance, program staff may, in the exercise of\nprofessional judgment, determine whether the access, use, or disclosure is\nnecessary to prevent imminent, serious harm to the individual. If so, only that\npersonal health information that is necessary to protect the individual from\nthe anticipated harm or which is in the best interest of the individual may be\naccessed, used, or disclosed. The reasons for the access, use, or disclosure\nmust be appropriately documented in the clinical record. (3)\n\nThe program shall attempt to obtain\ncollateral information on all individuals unless the presentation is due to a\nnon-emergent reason, including but not limited to an asymptomatic individual\npresenting for a medication refill. When contacting collaterals staff shall\nassess whether the source of collateral information is able to provide\nsufficient high-quality information to determine risk, symptomatology and\nfunctioning in the community, treatment history, engagement in treatment, and\nongoing stressors. If the source of collateral information is not able to\nprovide sufficient high-quality information, attempts shall be made to identify\nand contact additional sources of collateral information. (4)\n\nThe program shall access the Psychiatric\n\nServices and Clinical Knowledge Enhancement System (PSYCKES) or other available\nelectronic health records or database(s) to identify the individual's treatment\nproviders and prior medication use and/or treatment engagement history with\nconsent as required. In the event of incapacity or emergency circumstance, staff may temporarily access a PSYCKES clinical profile, for the limited\npurposes authorized by this section and in accordance with PSYCKES Policies and\n\nProcedures. (5)\n\nThe program shall\naccess all other available information network databases to review relevant\ninformation on the individual with appropriate consent as may be required and\nin accordance with the database policy or as authorized by other policy, law or\nregulation. (6)\nA practitioner or\ndesignee, as defined by article 33 of the Public Health Law, from the program\nshall review the I-STOP and PMP registry to obtain the controlled substance\nprescription history of each admitted individual. (7)\n\nThe program shall check PSYCKES to see if\nthe individual has a psychiatric advance directive (PAD), wellness plan, or\npreferred contacts. The program shall obtain appropriate consent as required to\naccess the full view of the PAD, wellness plan, or preferred contacts. In the\nevent of incapacity or emergency circumstance, staff may temporarily access a\nPSYCKES clinical profile, for the limited purposes authorized by this section\nand in accordance with PSYCKES Policies and Procedures. If the individual does\nnot have a PAD, the program shall provide a copy and explanation of the PAD. If\nthe individual chooses to complete a PAD, it shall be placed in their chart. (f) Screening and\nassessment\n(1)\n\nAll individuals must be\nscreened for suicide risk using a validated instrument. Positive screens must\nbe followed by a suicide risk assessment by a licensed professional trained in\nassessing suicide risk. (2)\n\nEach\ncomprehensive psychiatric emergency program (CPEP) must have policies regarding\nviolence risk and screening. All individuals must be screened, and the CPEP\npolicy must describe a process for subsequent assessment and intervention in\nthe case of a positive screen. As part of the screening, all individuals must\nbe asked about access to firearms or other weapons. (3)\n\nAll individuals over 12 years old must be\nscreened for substance use using a validated instrument. Positive screens shall\nbe followed by an assessment for high risk substance use and substance use\ndisorder by a licensed professional or CASAC working within their scope of\npractice. (4)\nA determination must\nbe made as to whether an individual has complex needs. (5)\n\nAssessments shall be strength-based and\nperson-centered. (g) The\ncommissioner or his or her designee may prevent new admissions to the\ncomprehensive psychiatric emergency program emanating from emergency medical\nservices, ambulance services and law enforcement if a conclusion is reached\nthat the ability of the program to deliver quality service would be\njeopardized. (1)\n\nThe commissioner or his or\nher designee shall review the continued necessity for such prevention at least\nonce every 24 hours according to a mutually developed plan. (2)\n\nThe comprehensive psychiatric emergency\nprogram shall develop a contingency plan with other local affiliated hospitals, emergency medical services and law enforcement for the prevention of new\nadmissions during periods of high demand and overcrowding. (3)\n\nWhere a comprehensive psychiatric\nemergency program prevents new admissions pursuant to this paragraph, the\ncomprehensive psychiatric emergency program must notify the appropriate OMH\nField Office according to a mutually developed plan. (h) Discharge criteria. The provisions of section 29.15 of the Mental Hygiene Law\nshall not apply to the discharge of an individual from a comprehensive\npsychiatric emergency program, however: (1)\n\nDischarge planning shall be conducted for\nall persons discharged from a comprehensive psychiatric emergency program who\nhave been determined to require additional mental health services after triage\nand referral or full emergency visit and for those persons admitted to extended\nobservation beds who require additional mental health services. (2)\n\nDischarge planning criteria shall include\nat least the following activities prior to discharge from the comprehensive\npsychiatric emergency program: (i) When\ndetermining whether an individual is ready for discharge and the most\nappropriate discharge setting, the whole clinical presentation and history, as\nwell as the availability of existing services and supports in the individual's\ncommunity, must be considered. This includes if an individual resides in a\nresidential program licensed by the office or supportive housing. (ii)\n\nThe discharge plan shall be developed\nthrough shared decision making in a person-centered process and must reflect\nindividual strengths and level of social support and address psychiatric, substance use disorder, chronic medical, and social needs. The plan must also\naddress relevant information obtained from collateral sources of information. (iii)\n\nFor discharges of\nindividuals with complex needs, the CPEP must provide a verbal clinical\nsign-out on the day of discharge, or as soon as possible thereafter, to the\nreceiving outpatient behavioral health treatment program and, if applicable, the residential program licensed or funded by the office or Office of Addiction\n\nServices and Supports, Office for Persons with Developmental Disabilities or\nthe Department of Health where the individual will reside after discharge. This\nmust be done in accordance with section 33.13 of the Mental Hygiene Law. (iv)\n\nThe CPEP must send a discharge\nsummary detailing the presenting history of present illness (HPI), hospital\ncourse, and other relevant information to the outpatient, residential, or\nlong-term care program within seven days of discharge, in accordance with\nsection 33.13 of the Mental Hygiene Law. (v) If the individual is enrolled in\noutpatient (e.g., Health Home Care Coordination or Specialty Mental Health Care\n\nManagement (Health Home Plus)), residential care management (e.g., OMH licensed\nor funded supportive housing or residential treatment), or has an active AOT\norder, CPEP staff must coordinate discharge plan details and timing with care\nmanagers. (vi)\n\nFor individuals with\ncomplex needs enrolled in a MCO Plan who are eligible but not enrolled in\nintensive care management or are enrolled in care management but need intensive\ncare management, CPEP staff must call the MCO and inform the MCO of the\ndischarge. (vii)\n\nPrior to\ndischarge, and in accordance with section 33.13 of the Mental Hygiene Law, the\nCPEP shall schedule and confirm a follow up appointment with an identified\nprovider to occur within seven calendar days following discharge. If, after\nmaking diligent efforts, a CPEP cannot identify an aftercare provider with an\navailable appointment within seven calendar days, the CPEP shall document its\nefforts and schedule the appointment for as soon as possible thereafter. A\nreferral to a walk-in intake clinic is insufficient to meet this requirement. Individuals who are leaving the CPEP against medical advice, or who state they\ndo not wish to receive aftercare services, shall be provided information about\navailable treatment options and have an appointment scheduled whenever\npossible. When an appointment for mental health services cannot be made within\nseven calendar days, crisis outreach teams or other available comprehensive\npsychiatric emergency program staff shall provide crisis outreach until the\ninitial appointment occurs and such services shall be reimbursed pursuant to\nsection 591.4 of this Title. (viii)\ncompletion of referrals to other community services providers, including peer\nsupport services, in collaboration with the individual receiving services and\ncomprehensive psychiatric emergency program staff, to address the person's\nidentified needs. (ix)\neach\nindividual shall be given the opportunity to participate in the development of\nhis or her discharge plan. Absent the objection of the person and when\nclinically appropriate, reasonable attempts shall be made to contact\ncollaterals for their participation in the discharge planning program. However, no person or family member shall be required to agree to the person's\ndischarge. A notation shall be made in the person's record if such person\nobjects to the discharge plan or any part thereof. (x) All individuals must be screened for\nsuicidality prior to their discharge. Individuals with an elevated risk of\nself-harm or suicide must have a community suicide safety plan completed before\ndischarge. Lethal means shall be identified and a plan for restriction\naddressed in the Safety Plan. The CPEP shall document their work with\ncollaterals to implement the plan to restrict lethal means and confirm\ncompletion prior to discharge. (xi)\n\nDischarge of individuals with an elevated risk of violence shall include, to\nevery extent possible, close collaboration with current and new outpatient\ntreatment providers, residential providers if applicable, and the county DCS if\napplicable to incorporate strategies to address violence risk factors and\naccess to weapons into the overall discharge plan in accordance with section\n33.13 of the Mental Hygiene Law. (xii)\n\nIndividuals who meet criteria for any\nsubstance use disorder shall be offered pharmacological interventions, if\nappropriate, and referred to a new or existing provider who can continue\ntreatment for their substance use disorder. (3)\n\nThe comprehensive psychiatric emergency\nprogram shall verify that after-care appointment(s) occurred and follow up with\nindividuals to ensure satisfactory linkage to care. Until linkage to care is\ncompleted, or for other clinically-indicated reasons, comprehensive psychiatric\nemergency program staff shall provide crisis outreach services to ensure\nindividuals are safe and stable in the community and continue to provide\nsupport, care and assistance with linkage to follow up care. Such services\nshall be reimbursed pursuant to section 591.4(f) of this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
