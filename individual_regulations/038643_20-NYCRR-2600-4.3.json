The preparer must advise the client of the consequences as provided\nunder the applicable Federal, State or local laws and regulations of such\nnoncompliance, error, or omission. A preparer who knows that a return or\ndocument that has been prepared for filing contains an error or omission, may\nnot sign, submit or file that return or document with the department, by\nelectronic means or otherwise. (b) Diligence as to accuracy. (1)\n\nDue diligence.

(2)\n\nPresumption of due diligence. A tax\nreturn preparer will be presumed to have exercised due diligence for purposes\nof this subdivision if the preparer relies on the work product of another\nperson and the preparer used reasonable care in engaging, supervising, training, and evaluating the person, taking proper account of the nature of the\nrelationship between the preparer and the person. (c) Prompt disposition of pending matters. A\ntax return preparer may not unreasonably delay the prompt disposition of any\nmatter before the department relating to a return prepared by the\npreparer. (d) Assistance from or to\npersons whose registration has been refused, cancelled, or suspended. A tax\nreturn preparer may not, directly or indirectly, knowingly accept assistance\nfrom or assist any person who has been refused registration as a tax return\npreparer, or whose registration has been cancelled or suspended, if the\nassistance relates to the preparation of a New York State tax return other than\nthe return of the person whose registration has been refused, cancelled, or\nsuspended. (e) Fees, notaries and\ncheck cashing. (1)\n\nFees. A tax return\npreparer may not charge an unconscionable fee in connection with any matter\nbefore the department relating to a return prepared by the preparer. For\npurposes of this paragraph, a fee is unconscionable if the amount of the fee is\neither excessive or unreasonable based on all of the relevant facts and\ncircumstances, including the complexity of the underlying issue or issues to be\naddressed with respect to the matter and the time required to resolve the\nmatter before the department. (2)\n\nNotaries. A tax return preparer may not take acknowledgments, administer oaths, certify papers, or perform any official act as a notary public with respect to\nany matter administered by the department and for which he or she is employed\nas a tax return preparer.

In general, a tax return\npreparer must, at the request of a client, promptly return any and all records\nof the client that are necessary for the client to comply with his or her\n\nFederal, State or local tax obligations. The preparer may retain copies of the\nrecords returned to a client. The existence of a dispute over fees generally\ndoes not relieve the preparer of his or her responsibility under this\nsection. (2)\n\nRecords of the client\ndefined. For purposes of this section, records of the client include all\ndocuments or written or electronic materials provided to the tax return\npreparer, or obtained by the preparer in the course of the preparer's\nrepresentation of the client, that preexisted the retention of the preparer by\nthe client. The term also includes materials that were prepared by the client\nor a third party (not including an employee or agent of the preparer) at any\ntime and provided to the preparer with respect to the subject matter of the\nrepresentation. The term also includes any return, claim for refund, schedule, affidavit, appraisal or any other document prepared by the preparer, or his or\nher employee or agent, that was presented to the client with respect to a prior\nrepresentation if such document is necessary for the taxpayer to comply with\nhis or her current Federal, State or local tax obligations. The term does not\ninclude any return, claim for refund, schedule, affidavit, appraisal or any\nother document prepared by the preparer or the preparer's firm, employees or\nagents if the preparer is withholding such document pending the client's\nperformance of its contractual obligation to pay fees with respect to such\ndocument. (g) Conflicting interests. (1)\n\nGeneral. Except as\nprovided by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, a tax return preparer shall not\nprepare a return for a client or represent a client before the department in a\nmatter involving a return prepared by the preparer if the preparer's\ninvolvement in the matter involves a conflict of interest. A conflict of\ninterest exists if: (i) the representation of\none client will be directly adverse to another client; or\n(ii)\nthere is a significant risk that the\nrepresentation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the tax\nreturn preparer's responsibilities to another client, a former client or a\nthird person, or by a personal interest of the preparer. (2)\n\nWaiver. Notwithstanding the existence of\na conflict of interest under paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the tax return\npreparer may prepare a return or represent a client in connection with a return\nprepared by the preparer if: (i) the preparer\nreasonably believes that the preparer will be able to provide competent and\ndiligent representation to each affected client; (ii)\nthe representation is not prohibited by\nlaw; and\n(iii)\neach affected client\nwaives the conflict of interest and gives informed consent, confirmed in\nwriting by each affected client, at the time the existence of the conflict of\ninterest is known by the preparer. The confirmation may be made within a\nreasonable period of time after the informed consent, but in no event later\nthan 90 days. Copies of the written consents must be retained by the preparer\nfor at least 36 months from the date of the conclusion of the representation of\nthe affected clients, and must be provided to any officer or employee of the\ndepartment on request. (h) Submission of tax returns, affidavits and\nother documents to the department. (1)\n\nGeneral. A tax return preparer may not willfully, recklessly, or through gross\nincompetence: (i) sign a tax return or claim\nfor refund that the tax return preparer knows or reasonably should know\ncontains a position that: (a) lacks a\nreasonable basis; (b) is an\nunreasonable position; or\n(c) is a\nwillful attempt by the tax return preparer to understate the liability for tax\nor a reckless or intentional disregard of rules or regulations by the tax\nreturn preparer; (ii)\nadvise a client to take a position on a tax return or claim for refund, or\nprepare a portion of a tax return or claim for refund containing a position\nthat: (a) lacks a reasonable basis; (b) is an unreasonable position; or\n(c) is a willful attempt by the tax return\npreparer to understate the liability for tax or a reckless or intentional\ndisregard of rules or regulations by the tax return preparer. (2)\n\nPattern of conduct. A pattern of conduct is a factor that will be taken into account in determining\nwhether a tax return preparer acted willfully, recklessly, or through gross\nincompetence. (3)\n\nFrivolous\nposition. A tax return preparer may not take a frivolous position or advise a\nclient to take a frivolous position on a tax return, affidavit, or other\ndocument submitted to the department, whether in paper form or\nelectronically. (4)\n\nAdvice\nregarding submissions. A preparer may not advise a client to submit a tax\nreturn, affidavit, or other paper or electronic document to the department, if\nin connection with the document: (i) the\npurpose is to delay or impede the administration of Federal, State or local tax\nlaws; (ii)\nthe document or return\ncontains a position that is frivolous; or\n(iii)\nthe document or return contains or\nomits information in a manner that demonstrates an intentional disregard of a\nstatute, regulation or established case law unless the preparer also advises\nthe client to submit a document that evidences a good faith challenge to the\nstatute, regulation or established case law. (5)\n\nAdvice regarding penalties. Advising\nclients on potential penalties. (i) A\npreparer must inform a client of any penalties that are reasonably likely to\napply to the client with respect to: (a) A\nposition taken on a tax return if: (1)\nthe\npreparer advised the client with respect to the position; or\n(2)\nthe preparer prepared or signed the tax\nreturn; and\n(b) any tax\nreturn, affidavit, or other paper or electronic document prepared or signed by\nthe preparer and submitted to the department. (ii)\n\nThe preparer also must inform the client\nof any opportunity to avoid any such penalties by disclosure, if relevant, and\nof the requirements for adequate disclosure. (6)\n\nRelying on information furnished by\nclients. A tax return preparer advising a client to take a position on a tax\nreturn, document, affidavit or other paper or electronic submission to the\ndepartment, or preparing or signing a tax return as a preparer, generally may\nrely in good faith without verification upon information furnished by the\nclient. The preparer may not, however, ignore the implications of information\nfurnished to, or actually known by, the preparer, and must make reasonable\ninquiries if the information as furnished appears to be incorrect, inconsistent\nwith an important fact or another factual assumption, or incomplete. (7)\n\nResponsibility of persons with principal\nauthority. Any person, whether or not a tax return preparer, who has (or\npersons who have or share) principal authority and responsibility for\noverseeing a firm's practice of preparing tax returns, claims for refunds, or\nother documents by tax return preparers for submission to the department must\ntake reasonable steps to ensure that the firm has adequate procedures in effect\nfor all members, associates, and employees for purposes of complying with this\n\nPart. Any such person who has (or persons who have or share) this principal\nauthority will be subject to discipline for failing to comply with the\nrequirements of this paragraph if: (i) the\nperson through willfulness, recklessness, or gross incompetence does not take\nreasonable steps to ensure that the firm has adequate procedures to comply with\nthis Part, and one or more individuals who are members of, associated with, or\nemployed by, the firm are, or have, engaged in a pattern or practice, in\nconnection with their practice with the firm, of failing to comply with this\n\nPart; or\n(ii)\nthe person knows or\nshould know that one or more individuals who are members of, associated with, or employed by, the firm are, or have, engaged in a pattern or practice, in\nconnection with their practice with the firm, that does not comply with this\n\nPart, and the person, through willfulness, recklessness, or gross incompetence\nfails to take prompt action to correct the noncompliance. (i) Requirements for written\nadvice. (1)\n\nAny written advice (including by\nmeans of electronic communication) given by a tax return preparer concerning\none or more Federal, State, or local tax matters is subject to the requirements\nof this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe tax\nreturn preparer must: (i) base the written\nadvice on reasonable factual and legal assumptions (including assumptions as to\nfuture events); (ii)\nreasonably\nconsider all relevant facts and circumstances that the tax return preparer\nknows or reasonably should know; (iii)\nuse reasonable efforts to identify and\nascertain the facts relevant to written advice on each tax matter; (iv)\nnot rely upon representations, statements, findings, or agreements (including projections, financial\nforecasts, or appraisals) of the taxpayer or any other person if reliance on\nthem would be unreasonable; (v) relate applicable law and authorities to facts: and\n(vi)\nnot, in evaluating a tax matter, take\ninto account the possibility that a tax return will not be audited or that a\nmatter will not be raised on audit. (3)\n\nReliance on representations, statements, findings, or agreements is unreasonable if the tax return preparer knows or\nreasonably should know that one or more representations or assumptions on which\nany representation is based are incorrect, incomplete, or\ninconsistent. (4)\nA tax return\npreparer may only rely on the advice of another person if the advice was\nreasonable and the reliance is in good faith considering all the facts and\ncircumstances. Reliance is not reasonable when: (i) the tax return preparer knows or\nreasonably should know that the opinion of the other person should not be\nrelied on; (ii)\nthe tax return\npreparer knows or reasonably should know that the other person is not competent\nor lacks the necessary qualifications to provide the advice; or\n(iii)\nthe tax return preparer knows or\nreasonably should know that the other person has a conflict of interest in\nviolation of rules described in this Part. (5)\n(i) In\nevaluating whether a tax return preparer giving written advice concerning one\nor more tax matters complied with the requirements of this section, the\ndepartment will apply a reasonable tax return preparer standard, considering\nall facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, the scope of the\nengagement and the type and specificity of the advice sought by the\nclient. (ii)\n\nIn the case of an\nopinion the tax return preparer knows or has reason to know will be used or\nreferred to by a person other than the tax return preparer (or a person who is\na member of, associated with, or employed by the tax return preparer's firm) in\npromoting, marketing, or recommending to one or more taxpayers a partnership or\nother entity, investment plan or arrangement a significant purpose of which is\nthe avoidance or evasion of any tax, the department will apply a reasonable tax\nreturn preparer standard, considering all facts and circumstances, with\nemphasis given to the additional risk caused by the tax return preparer's lack\nof knowledge of the taxpayer's particular circumstances, when determining\nwhether a tax return preparer has failed to comply with this\nsubdivision. (j) Solicitation and advertising. A tax\nreturn preparer may not, with respect to conduct as a tax return preparer, in\nany way use or participate in the use of any form of public communication or\nprivate solicitation containing a false, fraudulent, deceptive, misleading or\ncoercive statement or claim. (k) Best practices. Tax return preparers should provide clients with the highest\nquality representation concerning Federal, State and local tax issues by\nadhering to best practices in providing advice and in preparing or assisting in\nthe preparation of a submission to the department. The best practices set forth\nin this subdivision are statements of practices for all tax preparers to aspire\nto achieve. A violation of a best practice defined in this subdivision will not\nalone constitute an act of misconduct by the preparer sufficient to support a\ndisciplinary action but such a violation, especially if indicative of a pattern\nof conduct, may be considered in determining whether a disciplinary rule set\nforth in the other sections of these standards has been violated. In addition\nto compliance with the standards of practice provided elsewhere in this Part, best practices include the following: (1)\n\nCommunication. Communicating clearly with the client regarding the terms of the\nengagement. For example, the preparer should determine the client's expected\npurpose for and use of the advice and should have a clear understanding with\nthe client regarding the form and scope of the advice or assistance to be\nrendered. (2)\n\nApplying law and\nfacts. Establishing the facts, determining which facts are relevant, evaluating\nthe reasonableness of any assumptions or representations, relating the\napplicable law (including potentially applicable judicial doctrines) to the\nrelevant facts, and arriving at a conclusion supported by the law and the\nfacts. (3)\n\nAdvice. Advising the\nclient regarding the import of the conclusions reached. (4)\n\nActions. Acting fairly and with integrity\nin practice before the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
