Air\nfor Drying Equipment\n\nFilter Media.--Intake air filter media shall consist of cotton\nflannel, wool flannel, spun metal, activated carbon, activated alumina, nonwoven fabric, absorbent cotton fiber, electrostatic, or other suitable\nmaterials which, under conditions of intended use, are non-toxic and non-\nshedding and which do not release toxic volatiles or other contaminants to the\nair, or volatiles which impart any flavor or odor to the product. Chemical\nbonding materials contained in the media shall be non-toxic, non- volatile and\ninsoluble under all conditions of use. Disposable media are not intended to be\ncleaned and re-used. Filter Performance.--The air supply system and/or ducting shall\nbe such that the air supply is caused to pass through suitable air filters\nproperly installed before coming in contact with product-contact surfaces of\nthe drying system. Supply air filters for air which will be heated before it\ncomes in contact with the product shall be of a design selected to operate at a\nface velocity, and installed in a manner which will allow the filter\nmanufacturer's rating to be 90 percent or higher, when tested in accordance\nwith the ASHRAE Synthetic Dust Arrestance test.A\nSupply air filters for air which will not be heated before it\ncomes in contact with the product shall be of a design, selected to operate at\na face velocity, and installed in a manner which will allow the filter\nmanufacturer's rating to be 85 percent or higher when tested in accordance with\nthe ASHRAE Atmospheric Dust Spot Method.A\nII. Air Under Pressure--Product-Contact\n\nSurfaces\nMATERIAL\nFilter Media.--Air intake and pipeline filters shall consist of\nfiberglass, cotton flannel, wool flannel, spun metal, electrostatic material, or other equally acceptable filtering media, which are non- shedding and which\ndo not release to the air, toxic volatiles, or volatiles which may impart any\nflavor or odor to the product. Disposable media filters shall consist of cotton flannel, wool\nflannel, spun metal, nonwoven fabric, U.S.P. absorbent cotton fiber, or\nsuitable inorganic materials which, under conditions of use, are non-toxic and\nnonshedding. Chemical bonding material contained in the media shall be\nnontoxic, nonvolatile, and insoluble under all conditions of use. Disposable\nmedia shall not be cleaned and reused. Filter Performance.--The efficiency of intake filters shall be\nat least 50 percent as measured by the National Bureau of Standards' \"Dust Spot\n\nMethod\"B using atmospheric dust as the test aerosol. The efficiency of either air pipeline filters or disposable\nfilters shall be at least 50 percent as measured by the DOP (Dioctyl\n1-phthalate fog) testC. Piping.--Air distribution piping, fittings, and gaskets between\nthe terminal filter and any product or product-contact surface shall be\nsanitary milk piping, except where the compressing equipment is of the fan or\nblower type. When the air is used for such operations as removing containers\nfrom mandrels, other nontoxic materials may be used. FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION\nAir Supply Equipment.--The compressing equipment shall be\ndesigned to preclude contamination of the air with lubricant vapors and fumes. Oil-free air may be produced by one of the following methods or their\nequivalent: 1. Use of a carbon ring\npiston compressor. 2. Use of\noil-lubricated compressor with effective provision for removal of any oil vapor\nby cooling the compressed air. 3. Water-lubricated or nonlubricated blowers. The air supply shall be taken from a clean space or from\nrelatively clean outer air and shall pass through a filter upstream from the\ncompressing equipment. This filter shall be located and constructed so that it\nis easily accessible for examination, and the filter media are easily removable\nfor cleaning or replacing. The filter shall be protected from weather, drainage, water, product spillage, and physical damage. MOISTURE REMOVAL EQUIPMENT.--If it is necessary to cool the\ncompressed air, an aftercooler shall be installed between the compressor and\nthe air storage tank for the purpose of removing moisture from the compressed\nair. FILTERS AND MOISTURE TRAPS.--Filters shall be constructed so as\nto assure effective passage of air through the filter media only. The air under pressure shall pass through an oil-free filter\nand moisture trap for removal of solids and liquids. The filter and trap shall\nbe located in the air pipeline downstream from the compressing equipment and\nfrom the air tank, if one is used. Air pipeline filters and moisture traps\ndownstream from compressing equipment shall not be required where the\ncompressing equipment is of the fan or blower type. A disposable media filter shall be located in the sanitary air\npipelines upstream from and as close as possible to each point of application\nor ultimate use of the air. AIR PIPING.--The air piping from the compressing equipment to\nthe filter and moisture trap shall be readily drainable. A product-check valve of sanitary design shall be installed in\nthe air piping downstream from the disposable media filter to prevent backflow\nof product into the air pipeline, except that a check valve shall not be\nrequired if the air piping enters the product zone from a point higher than the\nproduct overflow level which is open to the atmosphere. The requirements of this section do not apply when the\ncompressing equipment is of the fan or blower type. See illustrations depicting\nvarious air supply systems.
