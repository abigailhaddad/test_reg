  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 300.6 - Accessibility Graphic and Components\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following graphic and explanations of its component\nparts, as provided by The Accessible Icon Project (\nhttp://www.accessibleicon.org/icon.html\n), are included here for illustrative purposes only and to further emphasize that\nremoval of the word handicapped and the updated depiction of a dynamic person\nin a wheelchair broadcasts an important message that emphasis should be on the\nperson rather than the disability. Click to View\nimage\n\nClick to View\nimage\n\nHead Position\n\nHead is forward to indicate the forward motion of the person\nthrough space. Here the person is the \"driver\" or decision maker about her\nmobility. Click to View\nimage\n\nArm Angle\n\nArm is pointing backward to suggest the dynamic mobility of a\nchair user, regardless of whether or not she uses her arms. Depicting the body\nin motion represents the symbolically active status of navigating the\nworld. Click to View\nimage\n\nWheel Cutouts\n\nBy including white angled knockouts the symbol presents the\nwheel as being in motion. These knockouts also work for creating stencils used\nin spray paint application of the icon. Having just one version of the logo\nkeeps things more consistent and allows viewers to more clearly understand\nintended message. Click to View\nimage\n\nLimb Rendition\n\nThe human depiction in this icon is consistent with other\nbody representations found in the ISO 7001 - DOT Pictograms. Using a different\nportrayal of the human body would clash with these established and widely used\nicons and could lead to confusion. Click to View\nimage\n\nLeg Position\n\nThe leg has been moved forward to allow for more space\nbetween it and the wheel which allows for better readability and cleaner\napplication of icon as a stencil. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n300.6\n\nAdopted, New\n\nYork State Register November 19, 2014/Volume XXXVI, Issue 46, eff. 11/19/2014\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
