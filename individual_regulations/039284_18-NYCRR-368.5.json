  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 368.5 - Non-financial factors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Residence. Sufficient information shall\nbe obtained to establish the fact that the applicant for or recipient of AABD\nis found within or residing in the social services district on the date of the\napplication and subsequent thereto, except for temporary absence. (b) Support from legally responsible\nrelatives. Determination of the ability of legally responsible relatives to\nassist shall be made and enforced in accordance with applicable department\nregulations. (c) Transfer of\nproperty. Whenever investigation indicates that a person applying for AABD has\ntransferred or assigned his property, real or personal, prior to application, the reason for such transfer or assignment shall be sought and a determination\nmade as to whether such transfer or assignment was made for the purpose of\nqualifying for assistance. (1)\nA transfer of\nproperty made within one year prior to the date of the person's application for\nsuch assistance shall be presumed to have been made for the purpose of\nqualifying for such assistance. (2)\n\nIf it is determined that there was no intent to defraud the agency and that the\naction which the applicant took at the time the property was conveyed was a\nnormal transaction, not taken for the purpose of qualifying for assistance, such transfer or assignment shall not constitute a basis for denial. (3)\n\nIf transfer or assignment is found to\nhave been made for the purpose of qualifying for AABD, the agency shall\ndetermine whether the property is available for return to the applicant or\nassignment to the agency. When not available for return or assignment, the\napplication for assistance shall be denied. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
