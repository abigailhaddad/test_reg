  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 53.1 - Exemptions generally\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Various types of transfers are expressly exempted from the tax. Under\nsubdivision 5 of section\n270\nof\nthe Tax Law some of these transactions are exempt only if accompanied by an\nexemption certificate. (b) Transfers of certain types resulting from death, insanity, bankruptcy and\nsimilar contingencies, in which change of ownership is effected by operation of\nlaw, are exempted from the tax by section\n270-c\nof the Tax Law. No exemption\ncertificate is required for such transfers. (c) If a fiduciary, having possession of\ncertificates issued in the name of any one other than him, transfers the same\ninto the name of his nominee, such transfer is not exempt from tax under\nparagraph (d) of subdivision (5) of section\n270\nof\nthe Tax Law because it is not made \"from the name of\" the fiduciary. Likewise, no exemptions exist under paragraph (e) or (g), respectively, of subdivision\n(5) of such section 270 for a transfer by the owner of certificates issued in\nsome name other than his own to his custodian, or for a transfer by a broker of\ncertificates issued in some name other than his own to a customer upon whose\norder he has purchased them. However, if the applicable tax has been paid upon\nthe transaction in which shares or certificates were acquired by the transferor\n(fiduciary, owner or broker), and proper evidence of such payment is furnished\nto the transfer agent (see Part 52 of this Title), it is unnecessary to make a\ndouble transfer on the books of the corporation, first to the name of such\nparty, and then to the name of his transferee (the fiduciary's nominee, the\nowner's custodian or the broker's customer). If such a double transfer were\nmade, no tax would be payable, the tax upon the first step having already been\npaid, and the second step being exempt. Accordingly, if a proper exemption\ncertificate is submitted in proof of the exempt character of the second step, a\nshort-cut transfer may be made directly to the name of such\ntransferee. (d) Certain transfers\nnot expressly described in subdivision 5 of section\n270\nof\nthe Tax Law are exempt because they represent a combination of exempt transfers\n(e.g., since a transfer from the name of an owner to his custodian is tax-free\nand a transfer from the custodian to his nominee is tax-free, a transfer\ndirectly from the name of the owner to the nominee of his custodian is tax-\nfree). The principle is that where all the transfers in a chain of transfers\nare exempt from taxation, any of the intermediate links of the chain may be\nomitted and the transfer will still be exempt. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n53.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
