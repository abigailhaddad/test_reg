(1)\n\nExcept\nas otherwise provided every permanent appointment from an open competitive list\nand every original appointment to the noncompetitive, exempt or labor class\nshall be subject to a probationary term of not less than 26 nor more than 52\nweeks. This probationary term also shall apply to each appointment to a\nposition in which the appointee is not under the regular supervision of the\nappointing authority until the completion of prescribed schooling or off-\nthe-job training; provided, however, that such probationary term, in this case, shall commence after the successful completion of such training. (2)\n\nExcept as otherwise\nprovided, every promotion to a position shall be subject to a probationary term\nof not less than 12 weeks nor more than 52 weeks. For the purposes of this\nsubdivision, the term promotion shall include the appointment of an employee to\na higher-grade position in the noncompetitive, exempt or labor class. (3)\n\nEvery transfer and\nreassignment, as defined in section\n25.26\nof this Part, to a position\nshall be subject to a probationary term of not less than 12 weeks nor more than\n52 weeks, provided, however, (i) that this paragraph shall apply to a\nreassignment only where the reassignment is to a court under the supervision of\na different Administrative Judge, and (ii) that the appointing authority having\njurisdiction over a position to which transfer or reassignment is sought may\nelect to waive the probationary term required for such position. (4)\n\nThe Chief Administrator of\nthe Courts may establish, for specified titles, shorter periods of probation\nfor promotions, transfers and reassignments than those set forth in paragraphs\n(2) and (3) of this subdivision. (5)\n(i) An appointment, promotion, transfer\nor reassignment shall become permanent upon the retention of the probationer\nafter completion of the maximum period of service of the probationary term or\nupon earlier written notice, following completion of the minimum period, that\nthe probationary term is successfully completed, or, in the case of a transfer\nor reassignment, upon written notice that the appointing authority has elected\nto waive the serving of the probationary term. (ii)\n\nIf the conduct or performance of a\nprobationer is not satisfactory, his or her employment from such position may\nbe terminated at any time after eight weeks and before completion of the\nmaximum period of service, provided that the appointing authority may, in his\nor her discretion, and with notice to the probationer prior to the end of the\nprobationary term, extend the probationary period for an additional term of not\nless than 12 nor more than 26 weeks in a different assignment, in which case\nthe appointment may be made permanent at any time after completion of 12 weeks\nof service, or the employment terminated at any time after the completion of\neight weeks of service, and on or before the completion of 26 weeks of\nservice. (iii)\n\nThe\nprobationer's supervisor shall carefully observe the probationer's conduct and\nperformance and, at least two weeks prior to the end of the probationary term, shall report thereon in writing to the appointing authority or his or her\ndesignee. The supervisor shall also, from time to time during the probationary\nterm, advise the probationer of his or her status and progress. A probationer\nwhose services are to be terminated for unsatisfactory service shall receive\nwritten notice at least one week prior to such termination and, upon request, shall be granted an interview with the appointing authority or his or her\nrepresentative. (b) Trainee appointment or promotion. The probationary term for a trainee appointment or trainee promotion shall\ncoincide with the term of training service. If the conduct or performance of\nthe probationer is not satisfactory, his or her employment may be terminated at\nany time after the completion of a specified minimum period of service and on\nor before the completion of the term of training service. Such specified\nminimum period of service, unless otherwise prescribed in the announcement of\nexamination, shall be eight weeks. (c) Transfers and reassignments. A\nprobationer shall be eligible for transfer or reassignment, provided, however, that upon such transfer or upon a reassignment requiring service of a\nprobationary period, he or she shall serve a complete probationary period in\nthe new position in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as\nrequired upon his or her employment in the position from which transfer or\nreassignment is made. (d) Leave of absence. When a permanent\nemployee is promoted, transferred or reassigned to a position in which he or\nshe is required to serve a probationary term, the position thus vacated shall\nnot be filled during such probationary term except on a temporary basis or by\nan appointment made pursuant to section\n25.24\nof this Part. The employee\nso promoted, transferred or reassigned shall be deemed to be on leave of\nabsence from the vacated position. At any time during such probationary term, the employee shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to return to his or\nher previous position at his or her own election. If the conduct or performance\nof the probationer is not satisfactory, the probationer shall be restored to\nhis or her former permanent position. (e) Reinstatement. An employee who is\nreinstated to a position in accordance with section\n25.28\nof this Part shall serve a\nnew probationary period in the same manner and subject to the same requirements\nas apply upon original appointment to such position, unless otherwise provided\nby the Chief Administrator of the Courts. (f) Absence during probationary term. Any periods of authorized or unauthorized absence aggregating up to 10 workdays\nduring the probationary term, or aggregating up to 20 workdays if the maximum\nterm exceeds 26 weeks, may, in the discretion of the appointing authority, be\nconsidered as time served in the probationary term. When the\nprobationary term for a trainee appointment exceeds one year, any periods of\nauthorized or unauthorized absence in such probationary term aggregating up to\n20 workdays multiplied by the number of years, including a fraction of a year, constituting the probationary term, may in the discretion of the appointing\nauthority, be considered as time served in the probationary term. Any\nsuch periods of absence not so considered by the appointing authority as time\nserved in the probationary term, and any periods of absence in excess of\nperiods considered by the appointing authority as time served in the\nprobationary term pursuant to this subdivision, shall not be counted as time\nserved in the probationary term. The minimum and maximum periods of the\nprobationary term of any employee shall be extended by the number of workdays\nof absence which, pursuant to this subdivision, are not counted as time served\nin the probationary term. (g) Restoration to eligible list. A\nprobationer whose employment is terminated, or who resigns, before the end of\nhis or her probationary term may request that his or her name be restored to\nthe eligible list from which he or she was appointed, provided such list is\nstill in existence. The probationer's name may be restored to such list if the\n\nChief Administrator, after due inquiry, determines that the probationer's\nservice was such that he or she should be given another opportunity for\nappointment. (h) Service in higher-level position. When an employee who has not completed his or\nher probationary term is appointed to a higher-level position, the period of\nservice rendered by such employee in such higher-level position may, in the\ndiscretion of the appointing authority, be considered as satisfactory\nprobationary service in the lower position and may be counted as such in\ndetermining the satisfactory completion of such probationary term. At any time\nafter the expiration of the minimum period of the probationary term, or the\nentire probationary term if it be one of fixed duration, the appointing\nauthority shall, on request of such probationer, furnish a decision in writing\nas to whether or not service in such higher-level position shall be considered\nas satisfactory probationary service. In the event of an adverse decision by\nthe appointing authority, such probationer, at his or her request, shall be\nreturned to the lower position for sufficient time to permit the probationer to\ncomplete his or her probationary term. The employment of such a probationer in\nhis or her lower position shall not be terminated at the end of the\nprobationary term on account of unsatisfactory service unless he or she shall\nhave actually served in such position, in the aggregate, at least a period of\neight weeks. (i) Removal during probationary term. Nothing contained in this section shall be\nconstrued to limit or otherwise affect the authority to remove a probationer at\nany time during the probationary term for job abandonment pursuant to the\nprovisions of section\n25.28\n(e) of this\n\nPart, or for incompetency or misconduct.
