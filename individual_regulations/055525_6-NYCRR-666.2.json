Tit. 6 § 666.2 - Purpose and application of this part\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of this Part is to implement\nthe act by establishing statewide regulations for the management, protection, enhancement and control of land use and development in river areas on all\ndesignated wild, scenic and recreational rivers in New York State, except for\nprivate land in river areas within the Adirondack Park. Land use and\ndevelopment of private land in river areas within the Adirondack Park are\nsubject to the provisions of 9 NYCRR Part\n577. (b) It is the further purpose of this Part to\nprovide for the protection and enhancement of the interests of landowners in\nthe enjoyment and use of their properties in designated river areas and to help\nto insure that recreation and other uses are consistent with the intent of the\nact. (c) The regulations set forth\nin this Part may be complemented by the promulgation of regulations for\nindividual river areas. Such regulations shall be consistent with the act and\nno less restrictive than this Part and shall address the specific management\nissues that are relevant to individual river areas. (d) It is a purpose of this Part to encourage\nthe participation of local governments in the management planning process\nnecessary to achieve the goals of the act. It is a further purpose of this Part\nto authorize and encourage administration by local governments of those\nprovisions of this Part that are within their respective jurisdictions, in\nplace of the department's administration of such provisions, when such local\ngovernments are legally, technically and financially capable of administering\nsuch provisions in a manner consistent with the provisions of the act and this\n\nPart. (e) In its administration and\nenforcement of this Part, the department shall give primary emphasis to the\nprotection and enhancement of the natural, scenic, ecological, recreational, aesthetic, botanical, geological, hydrological, fish and wildlife, historical, cultural, archaeological and scientific features of designated rivers and river\nareas.

(g) All new land use or development in a\nriver area must be undertaken in compliance with the standards listed in this\n\nPart. No person will: (1)\nundertake a new land\nuse or development in a river area without a permit unless such use or\ndevelopment is listed as \"no permit necessary\"; (2)\nundertake a new land use or development\nallowed pursuant to a permit except in accordance with such a permit issued\nprior to undertaking the land use or development. (h) Any new land use or development not\nlisted in this Part as \"no permit necessary\", \"permit required\" or\n\"notification required\", is presumed incompatible with the purposes of the\nact. (i) Land uses lawfully\nexisting shall mean: (1)\nin the case of the\nsubdividing of land, the approval of such plat pursuant to section\n1116\nof the\n\nPublic Health Law or the conditional or preliminary approval of such plat\npursuant to section\n276\nof the Town Law, section\n7-728\nof the\n\nVillage Law or section\n32\nof the\n\nGeneral City Law; provided, however, that final plat approval is granted within\nsix months of preliminary plat approval; (2)\nin the case of the review of a site plan\nnot involving the subdividing of land, the approval by the appropriate body or\noffice of a city, town or village of the site plan; (3)\nin those cases not covered by paragraph\n(1) or (2) of this subdivision, the issuance of a building permit or other\nauthorization for the commencement of the activities or development for which\nsuch permit or authorization was issued; or\n(4)\nin the case of local government\njurisdictions which do not require such permits or authorizations or for land\nuses which do not require any government approval, the actual and substantial\nlawful commencement of the land use or development. (j) Any lawfully existing land use which is\ndiscontinued for one year following the effective date of this Part [30 days\nafter May 24, 1994] in a given river area, will thereafter be a new land use or\ndevelopment and be subject to the permit requirements and standards of this\n\nPart. This restriction will not apply to agricultural land included in a\ncertified farm plan which has been farmed in two of the preceding five years or\nwhich is enrolled in a Federal set-aside program. (k) Neither the act nor this Part will be\nconstrued to create or to confer upon any person any right of access, or of\ningress and egress, over, upon or to any private lands to reach water or bodies\nof water that are within a designated river area.
