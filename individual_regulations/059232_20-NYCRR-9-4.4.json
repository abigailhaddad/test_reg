  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 9-4.4 - Combination rules for REITs and RICs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Captive REITs and captive RICs will\nalways be included in a combined report under article 9-A, unless they are\nrequired to be included in a combined report under article 33. (1)\n(i) For\npurposes of determining under which article of the Tax Law a captive REIT or a\ncaptive RIC is to be combined, the rules in section 1515 will be applied first. If such captive REIT or such captive RIC is not required to be included in a\ncombined report under article 33, then it will be included in a combined report\npursuant to the rules included in section 210-C and further described in\n\nSubpart 6-2 of this Subchapter. (ii)\nA captive REIT or captive RIC is\nrequired to be included in a combined return under article 33 in either of\nthese circumstances: (a) When the corporation\nthat directly owns or controls more than 50% of the voting power of the capital\nstock of the captive REIT or captive RIC is a life insurance corporation\nsubject to tax or required to be included in a combined return under article\n33; or, if this condition in this clause is not satisfied, then\n(b) When the closest controlling stockholder\nof the captive REIT or captive RIC is a life insurance corporation subject to\ntax or required to be included in a combined return under article 33. (c) The term \"closest controlling\nstockholder\" means the corporation that indirectly owns or controls over 50% of\nthe voting power of the capital stock of a captive REIT or captive RIC, is\nsubject to tax under section 1501 or article 9-A or is required to be included\nin a combined return under article 33 or a combined report under article 9-A, and is the fewest tiers of corporations away in the ownership structure from\nthe captive REIT or captive RIC. (d) Examples. Example 1: Insurance Company X, which is licensed as a\nlife insurance company in New York State and subject to tax under section 1501, owns 100% of the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation Y, a general\nbusiness corporation subject to tax under article 9-A. Corporation Y owns 75%\nof the voting stock of a captive REIT. Because over 50% of the voting power of\nthe capital stock of the captive REIT is not directly owned or controlled by a\nlife insurance corporation subject to tax or required to be included in a\ncombined return under article 33 and the closest controlling stockholder of the\ncaptive REIT is a life insurance company, the captive REIT must be included in\na combined return with Insurance Company X. Example 2: Insurance Company X, which is licensed as a\nlife insurance company in New York and subject to tax under section 1501, owns\n100% of the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation Y, a general\nbusiness corporation subject to tax under article 9-A. Corporation Y owns 100%\nof the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation Z, also a general\nbusiness corporation subject to tax under article 9-A. Corporations Y and Z are\nengaged in a unitary business. Corporation Z owns 100% of the voting power of\nthe capital stock in a captive RIC. Corporation Y is the closest controlling\nstockholder in the captive RIC. Because over 50% of the voting power of the\ncapital stock of the captive RIC is not directly owned or controlled by\n\nInsurance Company X, and the closest controlling stockholder in the captive RIC\nis not a life insurance corporation subject to tax under article 33, the\ncaptive RIC is required to be included in a combined report under article 9-A\nwith Corporations Y and Z. Example 3: Same facts as in Example 2 except that\n\nCorporations Y and Z are not engaged in a unitary business. In this case, the\ncaptive RIC is required to be included in a combined report with Corporation\nZ. (2)\n\nIf a captive REIT owns the stock of a\nqualified REIT subsidiary (QRS), as defined in IRC section 856(i)(2), then the\nQRS must be included in any combined report required to be made by such\nREIT. (b) A non-captive\nREIT must be included in a combined report under article 9-A with its qualified\nREIT subsidiary. All other non-captive REITs are prohibited from being included\nin a combined report under article 9-A. (c) In the case of a combined report\nincluding a captive REIT, or a captive RIC: (1)\nsuch captive REIT or such captive RIC\nmust be included in the computation of the combined capital base; (2)\nintercompany dividends paid by such\ncaptive REIT to another member of the combined group are not eliminated in the\ncomputation of combined taxable income if the combined group is utilizing the\nsubtraction for small thrifts and qualified community banks that maintain a\ncaptive REIT under section 208(9)(t); (3)\nthe adjustments required by section 1503\nwill not include the deduction for dividends paid by such captive RIC to any\nmember of the affiliated group that includes the corporation that directly or\nindirectly owns over 50% of such RIC's voting stock; and\n(4)\ntaxable income shall be computed without\nregard to the deduction for dividends paid by such captive REIT or such captive\nRIC to any member of the affiliated group that includes the corporation that\ndirectly or indirectly owns over 50% of such captive REIT's or such captive\nRIC's voting stock. For purposes of this subdivision, \"affiliated group\" has\nthe same meaning as in IRC section 1504, but without regard to the exceptions\nprovided for in IRC section 1504(b). Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
