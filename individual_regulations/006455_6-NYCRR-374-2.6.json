(1)\n\nThe requirements of this section apply to\nowners and operators of facilities that process or re-refine used oil. Processing\nmeans chemical or physical operations designed to\nproduce from used oil, or to make used oil more amenable for production of, fuel oils, lubricants, or other used oil-derived products. Processing includes, but is not limited to: blending used oil with virgin petroleum products, blending used oils to meet the fuel specification, filtration, simple\ndistillation, chemical or physical separation and re-refining. The requirements\nof this section do not apply to: (i) transporters that conduct incidental processing operations that occur during\nthe normal course of used oil transportation as provided in section\n374-2.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart; or\n(ii)\nburners that\nconduct incidental processing operations that occur during the normal course of\nused oil management prior to burning as provided in section\n374-2.7\n(b)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nOther\napplicable provisions. No person shall construct or operate a used oil\nprocessing or re-refining facility unless a permit has been obtained in\naccordance with section\n374-2.10\n(c) of\nthis Subpart. Used oil processors/re-refiners who conduct the following\nactivities are also subject to the requirements of other applicable provisions\nof this Subpart as indicated in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this\nparagraph. (i) Processors/re-refiners who\ngenerate used oil must also comply with section\n374-2.3\nof this Subpart. (ii)\n\nProcessors/re-refiners who transport\nused oil must also comply with section\n374-2.5\nof this Subpart. (iii)\n\nExcept as provided in clauses\n(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, processors/re-refiners who burn off-specification used oil for energy recovery\nmust also comply with section\n374-2.7\nof this Subpart. Processors/re-refiners burning used oil for energy recovery under the following\nconditions are not subject to section\n374-2.7\nof this Subpart: (a) used oil that is generated by the\nprocessor/re-refiner may be burned in an on-site space heater, provided that\nthe requirements of section\n374-2.3\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart are met; or\n(b) the used\noil is burned for purposes of processing used oil, which is considered burning\nincidentally to used oil processing; (iv)\n\nProcessors/re-refiners who direct\nshipments of off-specification used oil from their facility to a used oil\nburner or who first claim that used oil that is to be burned for energy\nrecovery meets the used oil fuel specifications set forth in section\n374-2.2\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart must also comply with section\n374-2.8\nof this Subpart; and\n(v) Processors/re-refiners who\ndispose of used oil also must comply with section\n374-2.9\nof this\n\nSubpart. (b) Notification\n(1)\n\nIdentification\nnumbers. Used oil processors and re-refiners who have not previously complied\nwith the notification requirements of RCRA 3010 must comply with these\nrequirements and obtain an EPA identification number. (2)\n\nMechanics of notification. Used oil\nprocessors or re-refiners who have not received an EPA identification number\nmay obtain one by notifying the EPA regional administrator of their used oil\nactivity by submitting either: (i) a\ncompleted EPA Form 8700-12 (EPA Form 8700-12 is available at the EPA website, http://www.epa.gov); or\n(ii)\na\nletter requesting an EPA identification number. Call RCRA/Superfund Hotline to\ndetermine where to send a letter requesting an EPA identification number. The\nletter must include the following information: (a) processor or re-refiner company\nname; (b) owner of the processor or\nre-refiner company; (c) mailing\naddress for the processor or re-refiner; (d) name and telephone number for the\nprocessor or re-refiner point of contact; (e) type of used oil activity\n(\ni.e., process only, process and re-refine); and\n(f) location of the processor or re-refiner\nfacility. (c) General facility standards. (1)\n\nPreparedness and prevention. Owners and\noperators of used oil collection centers, transfer, processing and re-refining\nfacilities must comply with the following requirements: (i) Maintenance and operation of facility. Facilities must be maintained and operated to minimize the possibility of a\nfire, explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of used oil to\nair, soil, or surface water which could threaten human health or the\nenvironment. (ii)\n\nRequired\nequipment. All facilities must be equipped with the following, unless none of\nthe hazards posed by used oil handled at the facility could require a\nparticular kind of equipment specified in clauses (\na\n) through\n(\nd\n) of this subparagraph: (a) an internal communications or alarm\nsystem capable of providing immediate emergency instruction (voice or signal)\nto facility personnel; (b) a\ndevice, such as a telephone (immediately available at the scene of operations)\nor a hand-held two-way radio, capable of summoning emergency assistance from\nlocal police departments, fire departments, or State or local emergency\nresponse teams; (c) portable fire\nextinguishers, fire control equipment (including special extinguishing\nequipment, such as that using foam, inert gas, or dry chemicals), spill control\nequipment, and decontamination equipment; and\n(d) water at adequate volume and pressure to\nsupply water hose streams, or foam-producing equipment, or automatic\nsprinklers, or water spray systems. (iii)\n\nTesting and maintenance of equipment. All facility communications or alarm systems, fire protection equipment, spill\ncontrol equipment, and decontamination equipment, where required, must be\ntested and maintained as necessary to assure its proper operation in time of\nemergency. (iv)\n\nAccess to\ncommunications or alarm system. (a) Whenever\nused oil is being poured, mixed, spread, or otherwise handled, all personnel\ninvolved in the operation must have immediate access to an internal alarm or\nemergency communication device, either directly or through visual or voice\ncontact with another employee, unless such a device is not required in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (b) If there is ever just one employee on the\npremises while the facility is operating, the employee must have immediate\naccess to a device, such as a telephone (immediately available at the scene of\noperation) or a hand-held two-way radio, capable of summoning external\nemergency assistance. (v) Required aisle space. The owner or operator must maintain aisle space to allow\nthe unobstructed movement of personnel, fire protection equipment, spill\ncontrol equipment, and decontamination equipment to any area of facility\noperation in an emergency, unless aisle space is not needed for any of these\npurposes. (vi)\n\nArrangements with\nlocal authorities. (a) The owner or operator\nmust attempt to make the following arrangements, as appropriate for the type of\nused oil handled at the facility and the potential need for the services of\nthese organizations: (1)\narrangements to\nfamiliarize police, fire departments, and emergency response teams with the\nlayout of the facility, properties of used oil handled at the facility and\nassociated hazards, places where facility personnel would normally be working, entrances to roads inside the facility, and possible evacuation\nroutes; (2)\nwhere more than one\npolice and fire department might respond to an emergency, agreements\ndesignating primary emergency authority to a specific police and a specific\nfire department, and agreements with any others to provide support to the\nprimary emergency authority; (3)\nagreements with State emergency response teams, emergency response contractors, and equipment suppliers; and\n(4)\narrangements to familiarize local hospitals with the properties of used oil\nhandled at the facility and the types of injuries or illnesses which could\nresult from fires, explosions, or releases at the facility. (b) Where State or local authorities decline\nto enter into such arrangements, the owner or operator must document the\nrefusal in the operating record. (2)\n\nContingency plan and emergency\nprocedures. Owners and operators of used oil collection centers, transfer, processing and re-refining facilities must comply with the following\nrequirements: (i) Purpose and implementation\nof contingency plan. (a) Each owner or\noperator must have a contingency plan for the facility. The contingency plan\nmust be designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from\nfires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of used oil to\nair, soil, or surface water. (b) The provisions of the plan must be carried out immediately whenever there is a\nfire, explosion, or release of used oil which could threaten human health or\nthe environment. The facility operator must assure that the provisions of this\nplan are carried out in the event of an incident covered by it. (ii)\n\nContent of contingency plan. (a) The contingency plan must describe the\nactions facility personnel must take to comply with subparagraphs (i) and (vi)\nof this paragraph in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or\nnon-sudden release of used oil to air, soil, or surface water at the facility, and actions to be taken if the facility is shutdown for more than 24\nhours. (b) If the owner or operator\nhas already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC)\n\nPlan in accordance with 40 CFR part\n112, as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, or some other emergency or contingency plan, the owner or operator need\nonly amend that plan to incorporate used oil management provisions that are\nsufficient to comply with the requirements of this Subpart. (c) The plan must describe arrangements\nagreed to by local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and local emergency response teams to coordinate\nemergency services, pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1)(vi) of this\nsection. (d) The plan must list\nnames, addresses, and phone numbers (office and home) of all persons qualified\nto act as emergency coordinator (see subparagraph [v] of this paragraph), and\nthis list must be kept up to date. Where more than one person is listed, one\nmust be named as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the\norder in which they will assume responsibility as alternates. (e) The plan must include a list of all\nemergency equipment at the facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill\ncontrol equipment, communications and alarm systems [internal and external], and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list\nmust be kept up to date. In addition, the plan must include the location and a\nphysical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its\ncapabilities. (f) The plan must\ninclude an evacuation plan for facility personnel, including a description of\nsignal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate\nevacuation routes (in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by\nreleases of used oil or fires). (iii)\n\nCopies of contingency plan. A copy of\nthe contingency plan and all revisions to the plan must be: (a) maintained at the facility; and\n(b) submitted to all local police\ndepartments, fire departments, hospitals, and State and local emergency\nresponse teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services. (iv)\n\nAmendment of contingency\nplan. The contingency plan must be reviewed, and immediately amended, if\nnecessary, whenever: (a) applicable\nregulations are revised; (b) the\nplan fails in an emergency; (c) the\nfacility changes - in its design, construction, operation, maintenance, or\nother circumstances - in a way that materially increases the potential for\nfires, explosions, or releases of used oil, or changes the response necessary\nin an emergency; (d) the list of\nemergency coordinators changes; or\n(e) the list of emergency equipment\nchanges. (v) Emergency\ncoordinator. At all times, there must be at least one employee either on the\nfacility premises or on call (\ni.e., available to respond to an\nemergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the\nresponsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures. This emergency\ncoordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's\ncontingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location\nand characteristics of used oil handled, the location of all records within the\nfacility, and facility layout. In addition, this person must have the authority\nto commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency plan. Guidance: The\nemergency coordinator's responsibilities are more fully spelled out in\nsubparagraph (vi) of this paragraph. Applicable responsibilities for the\nemergency coordinator vary, depending on factors such as type and variety of\nused oil handled by the facility, and type and complexity of the\nfacility. (vi)\n\nEmergency\nprocedures. (a) Whenever there is an imminent\nor actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or the designee when\nthe emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately: (1)\nactivate internal facility alarms or\ncommunication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and\n(2)\nnotify appropriate State or\nlocal agencies with designated response roles if their help is\nneeded. (b) Whenever\nthere is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must\nimmediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of\nany released materials. This may be done by observation or review of facility\nrecords of logs, invoices, manifests, bills of lading, or other shipping\ndocuments and, if necessary, by chemical analysis. (c) Concurrently, the emergency coordinator\nmust assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result\nfrom the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct\nand indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (\ne.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-offs from water or chemical\nagents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions). (d) If the emergency coordinator determines\nthat the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten\nhuman health, or the environment, outside the facility, the incident must be\nassessed and findings reported as follows: (1)\nif the assessment indicated that\nevacuation of local areas may be advisable, the emergency coordinator must\nimmediately notify appropriate local authorities. The coordinator must be\navailable to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be\nevacuated; and\n(2)\nwithin two hours\nof detecting a spill, discharge, or release of used oil, the emergency\ncoordinator must notify the department Spill Hotline at (800) 457-7362, or, if\ncalling from out of state, (518) 457-7362. The emergency coordinator must\nimmediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene\ncoordinator (in the applicable National Contingency Plan under part\n300\nof\ntitle 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number\n[800] 424-8802). The report must include: (i) name and telephone number of reporter; (ii)\nname and address of facility; (iii)\ntime and type of incident\n(\ne.g., release, fire); (iv)\nname and quantity of material(s)\ninvolved, to the extent known; (v) the extent of injuries, if any; and\n(vi)\nthe possible hazards to human health, or\nthe environment, outside the facility. (e) During an emergency, the emergency\ncoordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other used oil, hazardous waste, solid waste or used oil-derived fuels or products at the\nfacility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and\noperation, collecting and containing released used oil, and removing or\nisolating containers. (f) If the\nfacility stops operation in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the\nemergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is\nappropriate. (g) Immediately after\nan emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for recycling, storing, or\ndisposing of recovered used oil, contaminated soil or surface water, or any\nother material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the\nfacility. (h) The emergency\ncoordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility: (1)\nno waste or used oil that may be\nincompatible with the released material is recycled, treated, stored, or\ndisposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; (2)\nall emergency equipment listed in the\ncontingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are\nresumed; and\n(3)\nthe owner or\noperator must notify the regional director of the department in the region in\nwhich the facility is located and local authorities that the facility is in\ncompliance with subclauses (\n1\n) and (\n2\n) of\nthis clause before operations are resumed in the affected area(s) of the\nfacility. (i) The owner\nor operator must note in the operating record: the time, date, and details of\nany incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days\nafter the incident, the owner or operator must submit a written report on the\nincident to the EPA regional administrator and the regional director of the\ndepartment in the region in which the facility is located. The report must\ninclude: (1)\nname, address, and telephone\nnumber of the owner or operator; (2)\nname, address, and telephone number of\nthe facility; (3)\ndate, time, and\ntype of incident (\ne.g., fire, explosion); (4)\nname and quantity of material(s)\ninvolved; (5)\nthe extent of\ninjuries, if any; (6)\nan assessment\nof actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this\nis applicable; and\n(7)\nestimated\nquantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the\nincident. (d) Quality control and rebuttable\npresumption for used oil. (1)\n\nTo\nensure that used oil managed at a used oil processing/re-refining facility is\nnot hazardous waste under the rebuttable presumption of section\n374-2.2\n(a)(2)(i)\n(\nb\n) of this Subpart, the facility owner or operator must\ndetermine whether the total halogen content of used oil managed at the facility\nis greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm. The owner or operator must make this\ndetermination, upon arrival of every used oil transport vehicle at the\nfacility, by obtaining a sample from each incoming load, in accordance with\n\nAppendix 19 of this Title or a method shown to be equivalent under section\n370.3\n(a) and (b)\nof this Title. Such sample must be tested by using an analytical method from\nSW-846, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e)(8)\nof\nthis Title, to determine whether the total halogen content of the load, whether\nor not commingled from various generators, is greater than or equal to 1,000\nppm. (i) If the tests for total halogens are\nperformed at other than a department acceptable laboratory, then five percent\nof all tests must have split samples taken and transmitted to a laboratory\nacceptable to the department. (2)\n\nIf the used oil contains greater than or\nequal to 1,000 ppm total halogens, it is presumed to be a hazardous waste\nbecause it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title. The owner or\noperator may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not\ncontain hazardous waste (for example, by demonstrating that the used oil does\nnot contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents\nlisted in Appendix 23 of this Title). (i) Laboratory analyses completed for purposes of rebuttable presumption must be\nperformed by a laboratory currently certified under the appropriate approval\ncategories by the New York State Department of Health's Environmental\n\nLaboratory Approval Program (ELAP). (ii)\n\nThe rebuttable presumption does not\napply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are\nprocessed through a tolling arrangement, as described in section\n374-2.3\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart, to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply\nto metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other\nmanner, or disposed. (iii)\n\nThe\nrebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are\ndestined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils\ncontaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other\nthan refrigeration units. (3)\n\nIf the owner or operator of a used oil\nprocessing/re-refining facility does not attempt or is unable to rebut the\npresumption, the owner or operator must immediately contact the appropriate\ndepartment Regional Environmental Remediation Engineer and reject the load, in\naccordance with the procedures of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. (4)\n\nUsed oil containing 50 ppm by weight, or\ngreater, of PCBs is a hazardous waste, excluding oil derived from small\ncapacitors, as defined in section\n371.4\n(e)(3)(ii)\nof\nthis Title, as the sole PCB contamination source. Applicable standards are\ncontained in Part 370 through Subpart 374-1 and Part 376 of this\n\nTitle. (e) Used oil\nmanagement. Used oil processors/re-refiners are subject to all\napplicable Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures ( 40 CFR part\n112, as\nincorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) in addition to the requirements of this section. Used oil\nprocessors/re-refiners are also subject to the Underground Storage Tank ( 40\nCFR part\n280, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) standards for used oil stored in underground tanks whether or not the\nused oil exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste, in addition to the\nrequirements of this section. (1)\n\nManagement units. Used oil processors/re-refiners shall not store used oil in\nunits other than tanks, containers, or units subject to regulation under\n\nSubparts 373-2 and 373-3 of this Title. (2)\n\nUsed oil tanks. Compliance with petroleum\nbulk storage regulations. (i) All aboveground\nor underground used oil tank systems, regardless of tank size, must be in\ncompliance with Part 613 of this Title. In addition, owners and/or operators\nmust comply with the following requirements: (a) Aboveground used oil tanks must be\nequipped with secondary containment: (1)\n\nThe\nsecondary containment system must consist of, at a minimum: (i) dikes, berms or retaining walls; and\n(ii)\na floor. The floor must\ncover the entire area within the dikes, berms, or retaining walls, except, for\ntanks existing as of January 14, 1995, where existing portions of the tank meet\nthe ground; or\n(iii)\nan equivalent\nsecondary containment system. (2)\n\nThe entire containment system, including\nwalls and floors, must be sufficiently impervious to used oil to prevent any\nused oil released into the containment system from migrating out of the system\nto the soil, groundwater, or surface water. (b) Used oil tanks at a facility licensed\nunder Part 610 of this Title do not require registration under Part 613 of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nNew\naboveground and new underground used oil tank systems, regardless of tank size, must be installed in accordance with Part 613 of this\n\nTitle. (3)\n\nCondition of\nunits. Containers and aboveground used oil tanks used to store or process used\noil at processing and re-refining facilities must be: (i) in good condition (no severe rusting, apparent structural defects or deterioration); and\n(ii)\nnot leaking (no visible\nleaks). (4)\n\nSecondary\ncontainment for containers. Containers used to store or process used oil at\nprocessing and re-refining facilities must be equipped with a secondary\ncontainment system. (i) The secondary\ncontainment system must consist of, at a minimum: (a) dikes, berms or retaining walls; and\n(b) a floor. The floor must\ncover the entire area within the dike, berm or retaining wall; or\n(c) an equivalent secondary containment\nsystem. (ii)\n\nThe entire\ncontainment system, including walls and floor, must be sufficiently impervious\nto used oil to prevent any used oil released into the containment system from\nmigrating out of the system to the soil, groundwater, or surface\nwater. (5)\n\nLabels. (i) Every container and aboveground used oil\ntank used to store used oil at a processing and re-refining facility must be\nclearly labeled or marked with the words \"Used Oil\". In addition, every\naboveground tank used to store oil at a processing and re-refining facility\nmust be labeled with the design capacity and working capacity of the\ntank. (ii)\n\nFill pipes used to\ntransfer used oil into underground used oil tanks at processing and re-refining\nfacilities must be clearly labeled or marked with the capacity of the tank and\nwith the words \"Used Oil\". (6)\n\nResponse to releases. (i) Any spill, discharge, or release of used\noil shall be subject to all applicable provisions of article 12 of the\n\nNavigation Law (NL sections 170 through 197) and its implementing rules and\nregulations, 17 NYCRR Parts\n32\n-\n33\nand Part 611 of this Title, regarding, but\nnot limited to, notification, clean up, and liability, and are also subject to\napplicable provisions of article 17, titles 10 and 17, of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law, and Subpart 613-6 of this Title. (ii)\n\nUpon detection of a release of used oil\nto the environment that is not subject to the requirements of subpart F of 40\nCFR part\n280, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, and Subpart 613-6 of this Title, the owner/operator must perform the\nfollowing cleanup steps: (a) stop the\nrelease; (b) contain the released\nused oil; (c) clean up and manage\nproperly the released used oil and other materials; (d) if necessary, repair or replace any\nleaking used oil storage containers or tanks prior to returning them to\nservice. (iii)\n\nWithin two\nhours of detecting a spill, discharge, or release of used oil, the facility\nowner or operator must notify the department Spill Hotline at (800) 457-7362, or, if calling from out of state, (518) 457-7362. (7)\n\nClosure. (i) Aboveground used oil tanks. Owners and\noperators who store or process used oil in aboveground used oil tanks must\ncomply with the following requirements within 180 days after used oil storage\nor processing has ceased: (a) At closure of a\ntank system, the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate used oil\nresidues in tanks, contaminated containment system components, contaminated\nsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with used oil, and, unless the\nmaterials are not hazardous waste under Part 371 of this Title, manage them as\nhazardous waste. In addition, the owner or operator must comply with the\nclosure requirements of section\n613-4.5\nof this Title. (b) If the owner or operator demonstrates\nthat not all contaminated soils can be practicably removed or decontaminated as\nrequired in clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph, then the owner or\noperator must close the tank system and perform post-closure care in accordance\nwith the closure and post-closure care requirements that apply to hazardous\nwaste landfills (section\n373-3.14\n[d]\nof\nthis Title). (ii)\n\nContainers. Owners and operators who store used oil in containers must comply\nwith the following requirements within 180 days after used oil storage has\nceased: (a) at closure, containers holding\nused oils or residues of used oil must be removed from the site; (b) the owner or operator must remove or\ndecontaminate used oil residues, contaminated containment system components, contaminated soils, and structures and equipment contaminated with used oil, and, unless the materials are not hazardous waste under Part 371 of this Title, manage them as hazardous waste. (iii)\n\nUnderground used oil tanks must be\nclosed in accordance with section 613-2.6 or\n613-3.5\nof this Title, as\napplicable, and the applicable requirements of 40 CFR\n280, subpart G, as\nincorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (f) Quality control plan. Owners or operators of used oil processing and\nre-refining facilities must develop and follow a written quality control plan\ndescribing the procedures that will be used to comply with the analysis\nrequirements of subdivision (d) of this section and, if applicable, section\n374-2.8\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart.
