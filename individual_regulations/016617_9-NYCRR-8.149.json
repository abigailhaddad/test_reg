  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8.149 - Executive Order No. 149: Expediting the Foil Process\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, we seek to further transparency and openness in\n\nNew York State government; and\nWHEREAS, the purpose of the Freedom of Information Law\n(FOIL) is, and has always been, to foster an open and transparent government\nthat all New Yorkers can hold proud; and\nWHEREAS, I received two bills pertaining to FOIL from the\n\nLegislature; and\nWHEREAS, while their goals were well-intended, these bills\nare seriously flawed and would radically transform the litigation process, are\nmyopic in their scope and focus only on one branch of government, and would\nonly serve to perpetuate a fractured system of transparency and data production\nby intentionally excluding other branches of government; and\nWHEREAS, Assembly Bill 114 has significant technical issues\nin that it: would substantially alter the balance of appellate rights between\nstate agencies and non-state agency requestors, in that the condensed timeframe\nwould only apply when a state agency appeals an adverse decision, which is\nnecessarily an inequitable outcome, conversely, a non-state agency party would\ncontinue to have the longer time periods for appeal that are currently allowed\nby law; would eliminate judicial discretion regarding the time available to\nperfect an appeal as permitted by Civil Procedure Law and Rules § 5530(c), which allows each department of the appellate divisions to set their own rules\ngoverning the time to perfect an appeal, and/or when an appeal is subject to\ndismissal for failure to prosecute and/or deemed abandoned; fails to provide\nfor an extension of the 60-day timeframe, even on consent; puts a substantial\nburden on state agencies to perfect their appeals and may make it difficult for\nagencies to serve and file appellate records and briefs, possibly compromising\na state agency's due process rights; and\nWHEREAS, Assembly Bill 1438-B also has significant\ntechnical issues in that it: would allow for attorney's fees to be assessed\nsolely against a state agency, rather than uniformly against both parties; would also allow for attorney's fees to be assessed against a state agency, even if the state agency ultimately prevails; would require a trial court to\nassess attorney's fees against an agency when an agency denies access to FOIL\nrequests in \"material violation\" of FOIL and with no reasonable basis for\ndenying such access; fails to define what a \"material violation\" is, allowing\neach court to define the scope of the term, and leaving litigants without any\nclarity; and\nWHEREAS, these bills fail to include the legislature in any\nmeaningful FOIL reform; and\nWHEREAS, I vetoed Assembly Bill 114 and Assembly Bill\n1438-B for the reasons set forth above; and\nWHEREAS, the Executive has and will continue to lead by\nexample in advancing transparency and efficiency in government and, consistent\nwith that principle, will immediately direct state agencies to fast track FOIL\nappeals, and will introduce legislation that will encompass these issues, address the described flaws, and execute more comprehensive FOIL reform that\nwill cover all branches of state government. NOW, THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M. CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nthe Laws of the State of New York, do hereby find that, in light of recent\nevents, we must do more to immediately advance transparency in government. Therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the\n\nState of New York and Section 28 of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, I hereby\ndirect all state agencies to adhere to the spirit of Assembly Bill 114, and\nmove post-haste in filing a notice of appeal, settling the record on appeal, and filing a brief, within 60 days, absent extremely complex matters or\nextraordinary circumstances outside agency control; and\nFURTHER, this Order shall take effect immediately and shall\nremain in effect until further notice. Signed: Andrew M. Cuomo\n\nDated: December 12, 2015\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n8.149\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
