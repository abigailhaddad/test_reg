  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 125.7 - Driveway profile\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In rural\nareas, recommended maximum grade within the highway right-of-way is 10 percent\nfor commercial driveways and 12 percent for residential driveways. In urban\nareas the recommended maximum grades are six and eight percent, respectively. Where special circumstances require driveway grades in excess of these\nrecommended maximums, an engineering determination is necessary by the\ndepartment to establish a safe profile design. (b) All driveways shall be constructed to\nslope away from the edge of pavement at the same slope as the highway shoulder\nwhich normally varies in slope from one-half to one inch per foot. This slope\nshall be continued the full width of the shoulder or longer to avoid causing a\nbump or depression on the shoulder area. (c) Whenever a change in a driveway grade\noccurs, the profile shall be rounded by connecting the two different grades\nwith a smooth vertical curve such that a normal shoulder is carried through the\ndriveway area. If possible, the low point of the driveway should be at or close\nto the center line of the highway ditch. (d) Where a sidewalk is located close to the\ncurb line and the driveway opening is to be provided by a depressed or cut\ncurb, the sidewalk should be warped to conform to the driveway profile. One or\nboth edges of the sidewalk may be depressed across the driveway providing the\nresulting sidewalk cross-slope does not exceed one-half inch per foot. A\nsidewalk grade shall not exceed 10 percent. In some cases, it may be necessary\nto discontinue the sidewalk across the driveway and construct a curb along each\ndriveway edge. In such cases, provisions shall be made for the\nhandicapped. (e) Where curb cuts\nare made for the construction of driveways, the entire curb section shall be\nremoved and replaced with a curb of one inch reveal. The removal of only the\nraised portion of the curb and paving over the broken section shall not be\nallowed. Cut curb ends shall be tapered from full height to one inch above\nground level in a distance of approximately two feet. Where drainage is carried\nalong the curb, the driveway shall be constructed with a short upgrade to\nprevent runoff from spilling into private property. Details of a curb cut are\nshown in section\n125.19\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n125.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
