  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4117.2 - Failure to finish\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If for any\ncause other than interference a horse fails to finish after starting in a heat\nor race, that horse shall be ruled out. (b) A horse finishing without its driver\ndriving shall be disqualified. (c) Any horse or sulky that shall leave the course, is disqualified and ruled out; except that, in races contested at a track without a continuous hub rail, if, in the opinion of the judges, a horse or sulky is forced off the course as a\nresult of the actions of another horse or driver, or as a result of a break\nfrom such horse's gait, the judges may determine the appropriate order of\nfinish. Any horse or sulky that may partly leave the course shall be\ndisqualified one or more positions, as appropriate, if, in the opinion of the\njudges, such occurrence has had a material effect on the finish of the\nrace. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4117.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
