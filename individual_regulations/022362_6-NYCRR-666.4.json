  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 666.4 - Classes of rivers and management objectives for river areas\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe system consists of three classes of rivers as\ndesignated under section 15- 2711 of the act. (a) Wild rivers are generally five miles or\nmore in length, free of diversions and impoundments, and accessible only by\nwater, foot or horse trail. Their river areas are primitive and undeveloped in\nnature. In general the minimum distance from the river to a public road or a\nprivate road open to the public is one-half mile. Management of wild river\nareas will be directed to the perpetuation of their wild condition. (b) Scenic rivers are generally free of\ndiversions or impoundments with limited road access. Their river areas are\nessentially primitive and undeveloped or are used for agriculture, forest\nmanagement and other dispersed human activities which do not in themselves\nsubstantially constrain public use and enjoyment of these rivers and their\nenvirons. Management of scenic river areas will be directed to preserving and\nrestoring their natural scenic qualities. (c) Recreational rivers are generally readily\naccessible, and may have a significant amount of development in their river\nareas and may have been impounded or diverted in the past. Management of\nrecreational river areas will be directed to preserving and restoring their\nnatural, cultural, scenic and recreational qualities, except in areas\ndelineated by the department as communities, which will be managed to avoid\nadverse environmental impacts and loss of existing river corridor\nvalues. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n666.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
