Every tank semi-trailer shall be equipped with brakes\nof such a character as to be automatically applied upon breakaway from the\ntowing vehicle and shall be designed to stop and hold such vehicles for 15\nminutes. In any tank semi-trailer the brakes shall be of such design that the\nbrakes on the trailer may be applied almost simultaneously or prior to the\nbrakes on the tractor. (b) Piping, hose and nozzle. The cargo shall be discharged through a system of\nrigid piping joined together by welding, screwed fittings, or vitaulic, gruv-a-grip flanged connections with O-ring or equal gaskets or equal\ncouplings, and if necessary or desirable flexible hose connections. Flexible\nhose connections, if used, shall be of armored or protected type gasoline hose\nfitted with standard screwed or flanged pattern fittings affixed to the hose by\nstandard internal expanding rings or machine pressed collars. Cargo lines\nbetween the tank and the pump suction shall be tested with the cargo tank as\nindicated in subparagraph (g)(1)(vi) of this section and subdivision\n1262.70\n(h), and\ncargo lines from the pump through the discharge hose shall be hydrostatically\ntested when so required by the Port Authority to a pressure 50 pounds above the\nnormal work pressure and so certified to the Port Authority in writing. The\ndelivery of product shall at all times be under the control of the vehicle\nattendant through the use of approved self-closing nozzles or approved\nunderwing fueling control devices operated by the attendant designed to shut\noff automatically upon release of hand or foot pressure-latching or fastening\ndevices on control units are not permitted. No delivery hose or hoses shall be\nused except: (1)\n\nStandard hose\ndesigned to handle gasoline or similar aircraft fuel at the highest pump\noperating pressures with allowances for surge conditions.

(c) Pumps. The flammable liquid cargo shall be discharged only\nby operation of hazardous liquid discharge pumps, driven by a power take-off\ndevice from the truck engine. Evidence of approval of such discharge pumps by a\nlaboratory or testing establishment designated by the Port Authority shall be\nsubmitted. Pumping compartments, if any, shall be ventilated to avoid\naccumulation of fumes. Power take-off devices shall include mechanical, hydraulic, or electrical units. (d) Valves and connections. All tank vehicles wherein the discharge piping is\nconnected to the bottom of the cargo tank compartments shall be equipped with\nan automatic shut-off valve located inside the shell of the tank in each\ncompartment outlet. On tank vehicles with discharge piping or pump suction\npiping connected from the top of the cargo tank, there shall be arranged in the\nsuction portion of piping, between every compartment and each pump, an\nautomatic valve or valves designed to close off the flow of product. Except\nduring tank filling or fuel delivery operations, such valves shall be kept\nclosed. The operating mechanisms for discharge valves shall be provided with\ntwo secondary manual \"emergency\" controls located on opposite sides and ends of\nthe tank vehicle separate from the regular discharge valve operating mechanism, and such control mechanism shall also be provided with fusible elements, sections or links at each discharge valve arranged to cause the valves to close\nautomatically in the event of fire. The fusible elements shall operate at a\ntemperature not exceeding 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The release mechanism for\ninternal or discharge valves under manual and/or fusible control shall be\narranged to effect closing of such valves and stop product discharge in not\nmore than 10 seconds operating time. (e) Trailer mounting. Semi-trailers shall be mounted by means of a\nfifth-wheel connection, the lower half of which shall be securely fastened to\nthe tractor frame, and the upper half securely fastened to the semi-trailer. A\nlocking mechanism shall be provided so the upper and lower halves may not be\nseparated except by manual release and a safety bolt or wire seizing shall be\napplied to retain the manual release. (f) Limitations. Tank vehicles operated on air terminal highways shall\nconform with all applicable portions of the State motor vehicle rules and\nregulations, provided that tank vehicles restricted to operation on terminal\nbuilding aprons, hangar aprons, cargo building operating aprons, or special\nservice roads not authorized for general public use, shall not exceed 102\ninches maximum over-all width, and 35 feet maximum over-all length for a single\nunit or 50 feet maximum over-all length for a semi-trailer unit without special\nwritten permission of the airport general manager or manager. (g) Cargo tank construction. (a) Capacity. Cargo tanks\nshall not exceed 6,000 gallons capacity, provided refuelers operating at\n\nKennedy International, LaGuardia and Newark Airports transporting type A and\ntype B turbine fuels may not exceed 10,000 gallons capacity including\nconstruction allowances under paragraph (g)(2) of this section and further\nprovide that truck filling racks to be used are designed for static electricity\ncode. (1)\n\nCompartmentation. (i) Every cargo tank shall be divided into\ncompartments and provided with baffles. (ii)\n\nEvery tank larger than 1,200 gallons\nshall be divided into compartments, none of which shall have a capacity\nexceeding 1,200 gallons. (iii)\n\nEvery tank and every compartment of a tank over 90 inches in length shall be\nprovided with baffles, the number of which shall be such that the linear\ndistance between any two adjacent baffles, or between any tank head or bulkhead\nand the bafflle nearest it, shall in no case exceed 60 inches. (iv)\n\nEach bulkhead required herein shall have\nadequate strength without undue stress or any permanent set to withstand a\nhorizontal force equal to the weight of so much of the contents of the tank as\nmay come between it and any adjacent bulkhead or tank head, applied as a\nuniformly distributed load on the surface of the bulkhead or tank\nhead. (v) Each baffle required\nherein shall have an area at least equal to 80 percent of the cross-sectional\narea of the tank. (vi)\n\nEach\ncompartment of the completed tank shall be hydrostatically tested and proven\ntight at three pounds minimum pressure at top of tank, at initial inspection\nand at such times thereafter as may be designated by the Port\n\nAuthority. (2)\n\nTolerance. A tolerance of 10 percent shall be allowed for tank\nor compartment capacity. (3)\n\nDome covers and tank outlets. Each compartment shall be fitted with an approved\ndome cover, securely fastened to the tank, constructed of steel, bronze or\nmalleable cast iron. The dome cover shall be hinged toward the front of the\nvehicle, be designed to open not more than 91 degrees, drop shut upon forward\nmovement of the truck and be fitted with a self-locking spring latch for secure\nclosing, and a gasket to prevent leakage during overturn in transportation.
