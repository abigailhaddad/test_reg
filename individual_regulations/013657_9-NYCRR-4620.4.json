  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4620.4 - Roulette\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Equipment. (1)\nA standard table has a betting layout, a\nroulette wheel and roulette balls. (2)\n\nWagers. All wagers at the roulette games\nshall be made with cash, scrip, chips or wheel checks. The color of the wheel\ncheck indicates the player, not a value. (3)\n\nRoulette wheels. (i) The wheel has 36 numbers and the symbols\n0 and 00. The table's area consists of the betting section and a large\nbowl-shaped recess called the bowl. This contains the wheel which is called the\nwheel head. The interior of the bowl has a back track that contains a groove\nrunning around the bowl's circumference. It is in this groove that the dealer\nspins the roulette ball. When the speed of the ball diminishes, the ball falls\nonto the bottom track of the bowl. The revolving wheel head and the bottom\ntrack are marked off by black lines into eight equal sections. In the center of\neach section on the bottom track there is a small obstacle. These obstacles are\nplaced alternately, vertically and horizontally and the rolling ball, as it\nstrikes them, is given a random and unpredictable motion. The bowl's bottom\nunderneath the wheel is open, and below it there is a flat base from the center\nof which rises a spindle. (ii)\n\nThe\nwheel head itself, the only moving part, consists of a disk or plate, slightly\nconvex in shape. Around its rim are partitions known as separators or frets, and the compartments or pockets between these are called canoes. These pockets\nare painted alternately red and black, except for two pockets that are green. Each of the red and black compartments bears a number from 1 to 36. The green\npockets carry the symbols 0 and 00. (b) Roulette personnel and their duties. (1)\nA roulette table with a single layout is\nusually worked by two persons. The person who spins the wheel and deals the\ngame is called the dealer. The dealer's assistant is called a\ncroupier. (2)\n\nDealer. The dealer is\nin charge of the conduct of the game. His main duties are: spinning the wheel, throwing the roulette ball, announcing winners, collecting losing bets, paying\noff winning bets. (3)\n\nCroupier. The\ncroupier separates and stacks the losing wagers that have been collected or\nswept from the layout by the dealer. The croupier helps the dealer pay off\nwinning bets. (c) The\nplay. (1)\n\nThe players begin making their bets\nby placing wagers on the spaces of the layout. The dealer starts the wheel\nspinning in a counterclockwise direction, then flips the ball onto the bowl's\nback track so that the ball travels clockwise. Players may continue placing\nbets while wheel and ball are in motion until the dealer calls: \"No more bets.\"\nThe dealer does this as the ball slows down and is about to drop off the back\ntrack. Bets placed on the layout after this announcement are not valid and must\nbe returned to the player or players. (2)\n\nWhen the ball falls and comes to rest\nbetween any two partitions of the wheel, it marks the winning number, a 0 or\n00, the winning color, and any other permitted bet that pertains to a winning\nnumber or symbol. The dealer immediately announces the winning number and its\ncolor, and the dealer points to the corresponding number on the layout. The\ndealer then collects all losing bets, not disturbing the wagers resting on\nwinning spaces, and pays off the winner or winners. The symbols 0 and 00 win\nfor the house all bets except those placed on 0 and 00. (3)\n\nOn the first spin the dealer has no fixed\npoint from which to spin the wheel or ball. Thereafter the dealer must spin the\nwheel and ball from the winning pocket into which the ball previously\ndropped. (d) Inside\nbets. The maximum bet shall be $2 or its equivalent in chips. (1)\n\nSingle-number bet or straight bet. The\nplayer places a wager squarely on one number on the layout, making certain that\nthe wager does not touch any of the lines enclosing the number. This indicates\nthat the player is betting that number to win. The house pays off at 35 to\n1. (2)\n\nThe symbols 0 and 00. These\ncan be played the same as any straight or single-number bet by placing the\nwager on either 0 or 00. The payoff odds are 35 to 1. (3)\n\nTwo-number bet or split bet. The player\nplaces a wager directly on any line separating any two numbers. If the winning\nnumber is one of the two wagered on, the player wins. Payoff odds are 17 to\n1. (4)\n\nThree-number bet or street\nbet. The player places his wager on the outside line of the layout. This\nindicates that the dealer is betting the three numbers opposite the wager, going across the layout (street). If the winning number is one of these three, the player wins. Payoff odds: 11 to 1. (5)\n\nFour-number bet, square bet, quarter bet\nor corner bet. The player places a wager on the intersection of the lines\nbetween any four numbers. If any one of these four numbers wins, the player\ncollects. Payoff odds: 8 to 1. (6)\n\nFive-number bet or line bet. The player places a wager on the line separating\nthe 1,2,3 from the 0 and 00 spaces at a corner intersection. This indicates\nthat the player is betting that one of the numbers 1, 2 or 3, or 0 or 00 will\nwin. Payoff odds: 6 to 1. (7)\n\nSix-number bet or line bet. The player places his wager on the intersection of\nthe side line and a line between two streets. If any of these six numbers wins, the player collects. Payoff odds: 5 to 1. (e) Outside bets. The maximum bet shall be $5\nor its equivalent in chips. (1)\n\nTwelve-number\nbet or column bet. The player places a wager on one of the three blank spaces\nat the bottom of the layout (some layouts have three squares marked 1st, 2nd, 3rd). This indicates that the player is betting the 12 vertical numbers above\nthe space wagered on. Payoff odds: 2 to 1. (2)\n\nDozens or twelve-number bet. The player\nplaces a wager on one of the spaces of the layout marked 1st 12, 2nd 12 or 3rd\n12. The 1st 12 indicates that the player is betting on the numbers 1 to 12\ninclusive; the 2nd 12, the numbers 13 to 24 inclusive; and the 3rd 12, the\nnumbers 25 to 36 inclusive. Payoff odds: 2 to 1. (3)\n\nLow-number bet (1 to 18). The player\nplaces a wager on the layout space marked 1 to 18, which indicates that the\nplayer is betting on the numbers 1 to 18 inclusive. The payoff is even\nmoney. (4)\n\nHigh-number bet (19 to\n36). The player places a wager on the layout space marked 19 to 36, which\nindicates that he or she is betting on the numbers 19 to 36 inclusive. The\npayoff is even money. (5)\n\nBlack\ncolor bet. The player places a wager on a space of the layout marked Black. (Some layouts have a large diamond-shaped design instead of the word Black.)\n\nThe player is betting that the winning color will be black. The payoff is even\nmoney. (6)\n\nRed color bet. The\nplayer places a wager on the space of the layout marked Red, or the red\ndiamond, and is betting that the winning color will be red. The payoff is even\nmoney. (7)\n\nOdd-number bet. The\nplayer places a wager on the space of the layout marked Odd. The player is\nbetting that the winning number will be an odd number. The payoff is even\nmoney. (8)\n\nEven-number bet. The\nplayer places a wager on the space of the layout marked Even. The player is\nbetting that the winning number will be even. The payoff is even\nmoney. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
