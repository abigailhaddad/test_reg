If the aggregate limits of liability shown in the Declarations are greater than $125,000, then the limit of liability is our maximum limit of liability for all damages resulting from any one ATV accident. We will apply the limit of liability to first provide the separate limits required by the laws of New York for: a. Bodily injury or death of any one person in any one ATV accident; b. Bodily injury or death of two or more people in any one ATV accident; and\nc. Injury to or destruction of property in any one ATV accident. This is the most we will pay regardless of the number of: a. Covered persons; b. Claims made; c. Vehicles or premiums shown in the Declarations; or\nd. Vehicles Involved in the accident. 2. If the aggregate limit of liability shown in the Declarations is $125,000, then that limit of liability is our maximum limit of liability for all damages resulting from any one ATV accident, except those damages for bodily injury resulting in death. We will apply the limit of liability to first provide the separate limits required by the laws of New York for: a. Bodily injury not resulting in death of any one person in any one ATV accident; b. Bodily injury not resulting in death of two or more people in any one ATV accident; and\nc. Injury to or destruction of property in any one ATV accident. This provision will not change our total limit of liability. Our limit of liability for bodily injury resulting in death is as follows: a.

Up to $100,000 for bodily injury resulting in death of two or more people in any one ATV accident, subject to a $50,000 maximum for any one person. If the limit of liability shown in the Declarations is not exhausted by payment of damages for: a. Bodily injury not resulting in death; or\nb.

OUT OF STATE COVERAGE. If an ATV accident to which this policy applies occurs in any state or province other than the one in which\nyour covered ATV\nis principally garaged, we will interpret your policy for that accident as follows: If the state or province has: 1. A financial responsibility or similar law specifying limits of liability for bodily injury or property damage higher than the limit shown in the Declarations your policy will provide the higher specified limit. 2. A compulsory insurance or similar law requiring a nonresident to maintain insurance whenever the nonresident uses a recreational vehicle in that state or province, your policy will provide at least the required minimum amounts and types of coverage. No one will be entitled to duplicate payments for the same elements of loss. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REQUIRED. When this is certified as future proof of financial responsibility, this policy shall comply with the law to the extent required. OTHER INSURANCE. If there is other applicable liability insurance we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits. However, any insurance we provide for a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any other collectible insurance.
