  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 50.15 - Designation of lasers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every laser not otherwise exempt by this Part (rule) shall have a label so\nattached as to be clearly visible and such label shall contain the following\ninformation: (1)\n\nThe laser radiation symbol\nin red. (2)\n\nThe words \"CAUTION\" or\n\"DANGER\" and \"LASER\" in black letters. (3)\n\nThe wave length or lengths of the emitted\nlaser radiation. (4)\n\nThe maximum\noutput power or energy density or densities of the emitted laser\nradiation. (5)\n\nThe divergence of\nthe emitted laser radiation in its lowest order transverse mode. (b) Such required information\nshall be legibly stamped, etched or otherwise permanently marked on a yellow or\nwhite label with letters and numbers not less than three millimeters (one-\neighth inch) in height where practicable. Exceptions: (1)\n\nIf\nsuch labeling of individual lasers is impractical because of laser size or\nlocation, such lasers shall be appropriately labeled in an alternative manner. Exceptions: (2)\n\nThe label on any laser used exclusively\nin research and development need not specify numerically the wave length, maximum output power or energy density or the divergence where such parameters\nmay be unknown or difficult to obtain. However, such labels shall contain the\nlaser radiation-symbol and the other wording required by paragraphs (a)(1) and\n(2) of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n50.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
