  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7.7 - Executive order no. 7: prohibition against personal use of state property and campaign contributions to the governor\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, government employment is a privilege rather than a\nright, and is based upon the trust and confidence placed in the State's workers\nby the public; and\nWHEREAS, all State employees and officers should be able to\npursue the interests of the public in an environment that is free from\npolitical party influence or interference; and\nWHEREAS, it is the obligation of every State employee and\nofficer to pursue a course of conduct that will not engender public concern as\nto whether the individual is engaged in acts that may violate his or her public\ntrust; and\nWHEREAS, all State employees therefore must act in a manner\nconsistent with that public trust, and must not take any actions that are\nintended, or appear to be intended, to achieve personal gain or benefit; and\nWHEREAS, employees and officers of State agencies and\npublic authorities are subject to certain ethical statutes and rules, including\nbut not limited to the State Code of Ethics (Section\n74\nof the\n\nPublic Officers Law), and statutory restrictions on business and professional\nactivities (Section\n73\nof the\n\nPublic Officers Law); and\nWHEREAS, there are some areas where New York's existing\nstatutes governing ethical standards can and should be improved or\nclarified; NOW, THEREFORE, I, David A. Paterson, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nthe laws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: A. Definitions\n1. \"Agency\" shall mean any state agency, department, office, board, commission or other instrumentality of the State, other than a public authority. 2. \"Public authority\" shall mean a public authority or public benefit corporation\ncreated by or existing under any State law, at least one of whose members is\nappointed by the Governor (including any subsidiaries of such public authority\nor public benefit corporation), other than an interstate or international\nauthority or public benefit corporation. B. Prohibition Against the Personal Use of\n\nState Property\n1. State supplies, equipment, computers, personnel and other resources may not be utilized for\nnon-governmental purposes, including for personal purposes or for outside\nactivities of any kind. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the\nfollowing: a. Official stationery may not be\nused for non-governmental purposes, nor may State government resources be used\nto mail personal correspondence. The designation \"personal\" on agency\nstationery means only that the contents are meant for the personal viewing of\nthe addressee and not that the sender is acting unofficially. All letters and\nother written materials printed on such official stationery are considered\nofficial, and thus the designation \"unofficial\" has no meaning and may not be\nused. b. Under no circumstances may\n\nState mail, postage, internal office mail, or inter-city couriers be used for\nnon-governmental purposes. c. State\ntelephones may not be used for non-governmental long-distance calls, except for\ntoll-free calls, collect calls, and calls billed to a personal telephone\nnumber. State telephones may be used for incidental and necessary personal\nlocal calls that are of limited number and duration and do not conflict with\nthe proper exercise of the duties of the State employee. d. State computers shall be used only for\nofficial business, except that state computers may be used for incidental and\nnecessary personal purposes, such as sending personal electronic mail messages, provided that such use is in a limited amount and duration and does not\nconflict with the proper exercise of the duties of the State\nemployee. e. State vehicles shall\nbe used only for official business or incidental personal use associated with\nofficial business away from an employee's official work station. Individuals\nwho are authorized by their agency or public authority to use a vehicle for\npersonal purposes shall keep records of such use, and the value of such\npersonal use shall be calculated and reported as personal income to such\nindividual for tax purposes. C. Prohibition Against Campaign Contributions\nto the Governor\n1. No State agency officer or\nemployee who serves at the pleasure of the Governor or their appointing\nauthority, and no member of a public authority appointed by the Governor, may\nmake or offer to make any monetary contribution to the campaign of the\n\nGovernor, or to any political campaign committee organized by or for the\nspecific benefit of the Governor. In addition, no such individual may request\nor demand that any other person make or offer to make any monetary contribution\nto the campaign of the Governor, or to any political campaign committee\norganized by or for the specific benefit of the Governor. D. Application to Public Authorities\n1. Each public authority shall adopt policies\nor rules applying the restrictions set forth above to all officers and\nemployees who serve at the pleasure of their appointing authority. E. Penalties\n1. Any violation of this order may result in\ndismissal or other appropriate sanction as determined by the appointing\nauthority of the individual committing such violation. Signed: David A.
