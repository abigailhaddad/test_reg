(a) No confidential HIV-related\ninformation shall be disclosed pursuant to a general release or subpoena\nwithout a court order, pursuant to Public Health Law, section 2785, unless such\nrelease is to another health care provider. Disclsoure is permitted for\nHIV-related information pursuant to a specific release form which has been\ndeveloped or approved by the Department of Health. The release must be signed\nby the protected individual, or if the protected individual lacks capacity to\nconsent pursuant to clause (vi)(\nd\n) of this paragraph, by a\nperson authorized pursuant to law to consent to health care for the\nindividual. (b) All written\ndisclosures of confidential HIV information must be accompanied by a statement\nprohibiting redisclosure. The statement shall include the following language or\nsubstantially similar language: \"This information has been disclosed to you\nfrom confidential records which are protected by state law. State law prohibits\nyou from making any further disclosure of this information without the specific\nwritten content of the person to whom it pertains, or as otherwise permitted by\nlaw. Any unauthorized further disclosure in violation of State law may result\nin a fine or jail sentence or both. A general authorization for the release of\nmedical or other information is not sufficient authorization for further\ndisclosure. Disclosure of confidential HIV information that occurs as the\nresult of a general authorization for the release of medical or other\ninformation will be in violation of the State law and may result in a fine or\njail sentence or both.\"\n(c) If oral\ndisclosures are necessary, they must be accompanied or followed as soon as\npossible, but no later than 10 days, by the statement required in clause\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph. All disclosures, oral or written, shall be recorded in the child's official record. (d) The statement required by clauses\n(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this subparagraph is not\nrequired for release to the protected person or to his or her legal\nrepresentative, for releases made by a physician or public health officer to a\ncontact, or for releases made by a physician to a person authorized pursuant to\nlaw to consent to the health care of the protected person when the person has\nbeen counseled and the disclosure is medically necessary pursuant to Public\n\nHealth Law, section 2782(4)(e). For disclosure of confidential HIV-related\ninformation from the youth's medical files to persons who are permitted access\npursuant to subclauses\n(vii)(\nb\n)(\n3\n)-(\n4\n), (\n6\n)-(\n7\n), (\n9\n)-(\n10\n) and\n(\n16\n)-(\n17\n) of this paragraph, it shall be\nsufficient for the statement required by clauses (\nb\n) and\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph to appear in the child's medical\nrecord. (ix)\n\nProtection\nof others at significant risk of infection. (a) Staff and child protection. Since medical\nhistory and examination cannot reliably identify all children infected with HIV\nor other blood-borne pathogens, blood and body-fluid precautions shall be\nconsistently used for all children. This approach, referred to as \"universal\nblood and body-fluid precautions\" or \"universal precautions,\" or \"universal\ninfection control procedures\" shall be used during job-related activities which\ninvolve or may involve exposure to significant risk body substances as defined\nin Department of Health regulations at 10 NYCRR, section\n63.9. (b) Facilities and programs shall abide by\nany additional regulations regarding protective barriers or procedures as may\nbe promulgated by the division. (c) Staff will educate children regarding behaviors which pose a risk for HIV\ntransmission. (d) Each detention\nfacility shall: (1)\nimplement and enforce a\nplan for the prevention of circumstances which could result in another employee\nor individual becoming exposed to blood or body fluids which could put them at\nrisk for HIV infection, during the provision of services. Such a plan shall\ninclude: (i) use of generally accepted\nprotective barriers during the job-related activities which involve, or may\ninvolve, exposure to blood or body fluids. Such preventive action shall be\ntaken by the employee with each youth and shall constitute an essential element\nfor the prevention of bi-directional spread of HIV; (ii)\nuse of generally accepted preventive\npractices during job-related activities which involve the use of contaminated\ninstruments or equipment which may cause puncture injuries; (iii)\ntraining at the time of employment and\nyearly staff development programs on the use of protective equipment, preventive practices, and circumstances which represent a risk for all\nemployees whose job-related tasks involve, or may involve, exposure to blood or\nbody fluids; (iv)\nprovision of\npersonal protective equipment for employees which is appropriate to the tasks\nbeing performed; and\n(v) a system\nfor monitoring preventive programs to assure compliance and safety; and\n(2)\nimplement and\nenforce a plan for the management of individuals who are exposed to blood or\nbody fluids. The plan shall include: (i) a\nsystem for voluntary reporting of all exposures thought to represent a\ncircumstance for significant risk; (ii)\navailability of services for evaluating\nthe circumstance of a reported exposure and providing appropriate follow-up of\nthe exposed individual which includes: (A)\nmedical and epidemiological assessment of the individual who is the source of\nthe exposure, where that individual is known and available; (B)\nif epidemiologically indicated, HIV\ncounseling and testing of the source individual as permitted under Public\n\nHealth Law, article 27-F. Where the HIV status is not known to the exposed\nindividual, disclosure can be made only with the express written consent of the\nprotected individual or pursuant to a Supreme Court order; and\n(C)\nappropriate medical follow-up of the\nexposed individual; and\n(iii)\nassurances for protection of\nconfidentiality for those involved in reported exposures. (x) Monitoring. Employees and agents of the division responsible for monitoring, inspecting, supervising, and investigating programs certified by the division shall have\naccess to confidential HIV information to the extent necessary to discharge\nthose responsibilities.
