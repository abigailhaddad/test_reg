Tit. 20 § 414.2 - Governmental entities\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 284(1), 289-c\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\n\nUnited States of America and any of its agencies and instrumentalities may: (i) import or cause motor fuel to be imported\ninto New York State; (ii)\nproduce, refine, manufacture or compound motor fuel in New York State; or\n(iii)\npurchase motor fuel in New York State, for their own use or consumption without payment of, or in the case of a\npurchase of such fuel, without having had passed through to them, the motor\nfuel tax imposed pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law. (2)\n(i) The\n\nUnited States\nas used in this section includes any department, office, bureau or other agency of the government of the United\n\nStates. (ii)\n\nAgencies and\ninstrumentalities of the United States\nas used in this section means\nany governmental authority, commission or independent board created by an Act\nof Congress for a public purpose, and which is immune from state taxation. Some\nentities, although created by an Act of Congress, are not governmental entities\nand are not exempt from the motor fuel tax. Where Congress has waived immunity\nfrom taxation with respect to instrumentalities or agencies of the United\n\nStates, no exemption from tax will exist. Further, states of the United States\nand their political subdivisions (excluding New York State), the District of\n\nColumbia, and territories and possessions of the United States are not exempt\nfrom the motor fuel tax. (b) (1)\n\nNew\n\nYork State, any of its agencies, instrumentalities, public corporations or\npolitical subdivisions may: (i) import or\ncause motor fuel to be imported into New York State; (ii)\nproduce, refine, manufacture or compound\nmotor fuel in New York State; or\n(iii)\npurchase motor fuel in New York State, for their own use or consumption without payment of, or in the case of a\npurchase of such fuel, without having had passed through to them, the motor\nfuel tax. (2)\n(i) New York State\nas used\nin this section includes any department, office, bureau or other agency of the\n\nState of New York. (ii)\n\nAgencies and instrumentalities of the State\nas used in this\nsection means any authority, commission or independent board created by an act\nof the Legislature for a public purpose. (iii)\nA\npublic corporation\nas used in this section means any corporation created by an act of the\n\nLegislature for a public purpose or pursuant to an agreement or compact with\nanother state or Canada. (iv)\nA\npolitical subdivision\nas used in this section means a county, town, city, village, school district, fire district, special district\ncorporation and board of cooperative educational services of this\n\nState. (c) (1)\n\nWhere a governmental entity as defined in\nthis section imports motor fuel or causes motor fuel to be imported into New\n\nYork State or produces, refines, manufactures or compounds motor fuel in New\n\nYork State for its own use or consumption, such entity is a distributor of\nmotor fuel and must be registered as a distributor and report these activities\nmonthly, by filing returns with the Department of Taxation and Finance, even\nthough no tax may be due. In the event the governmental entity does not use or\nconsume all such motor fuel and otherwise distributes the fuel in the State, it\nis subject to the tax imposed pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law on the\nmotor fuel distributed. (2)\n\nWhere\nmotor fuel is purchased by a governmental entity, without the seller passing\nthrough the motor fuel tax, and such fuel is not used or consumed by the\nentity, but is otherwise distributed in the State, such entity is jointly and\nseverally liable with the recipient of the motor fuel for the payment of the\nmotor fuel tax. (3)\n\nMotor fuel used\nby contractors in connection with work done for United States governmental\nentities or New York State governmental entities is not exempt from tax. Accordingly, where such contractors import or cause motor fuel to be imported\ninto New York State or produce, refine, manufacture or compound motor fuel in\n\nNew York State they are liable for the motor fuel tax and must be registered as\ndistributors of motor fuel. Purchases of motor fuel by contractors having\ncontracts with governmental entities are also not exempt from the motor fuel\ntax. Such tax must be passed through to a purchasing contractor by a seller of\nmotor fuel and included in the contractor's purchase price of the motor fuel. However, contractors may be reimbursed for taxes paid in respect of motor fuel\nconsumed in off-highway services pursuant to the provisions of section\n415.3\nof this Title. (d) (1)\n\nUnited States governmental entities and\n\nNew York State governmental entities (as defined herein) may purchase motor\nfuel upon which the seller has not passed through the motor fuel tax by issuing\nto the seller of such fuel a signed government purchase order, a signed\ngovernment purchase contract or an appropriate exemption document. For purposes\nof this subdivision, an appropriate exemption document must be made by the\ngovernmental entity claiming an exemption from tax, on its letterhead or on a\nprinted form issued by it, identifying itself as an exempt United States\ngovernmental entity or as an exempt New York State governmental entity. An\nappropriate exemption document must also contain a statement to the effect that\nthe motor fuel being purchased will be used or consumed exclusively by the\nsubject governmental entity. Such document must be signed and dated by a duly\nauthorized representative of the governmental entity seeking an exemption from\nthe motor fuel tax. (2)\n\nWhether a\nsingle tax-exempt purchase of motor fuel is made or multiple tax-exempt\npurchases of motor fuel are made, pursuant to any particular purchase order, purchase contract, or appropriate exemption document, each delivery of motor\nfuel must be substantiated as being exempt from tax with an individual bill, invoice, receipt or other form of written evidence given by the seller showing\nthe governmental entity as the purchaser. Every bill, invoice, receipt or other\nform of written evidence must indicate the quantity of motor fuel received, the\npurchase price of the fuel without regard to any exemption and the price paid\nor to be paid by the exempt purchaser for such fuel. In addition, such evidence\nof exemption must be signed and dated by the individual taking delivery of the\nmotor fuel on behalf of such entity. Sellers of motor fuel must establish a\nsystem of associating these individual bills, invoices, receipts and other\nforms of evidence with the applicable purchase orders, purchase contracts or\nappropriate exemption documents. (e) All purchases of motor fuel upon which\nthe seller has not passed through the motor fuel tax by a United States\ngovernmental entity or a New York State governmental entity must be billed\ndirectly to the governmental entity and paid from the funds of such entity. Alternatively, where a governmental entity has substantiated its exempt status\nto an oil company and such company consents to issuing credit cards to the\nentity for purposes of purchasing motor fuel, individual purchases will be\ncharged to such credit card accounts as if no exemption exists. Purchases of\nmotor fuel so charged to such authorized credit cards will then be billed to\nthe entity, exclusive of the taxes from which the purchaser is\nexempt. (f) (1)\n\nAny person selling motor fuel to a\ngovernmental entity for such entity's own use or consumption, as described in\nthis section, who has not passed through to the entity the motor fuel tax, will\nbe allowed a refund or credit in the amount of the motor fuel tax paid or\nassumed by, or passed through to such person but not passed through to the\nexempt purchaser. A refund or credit will also be allowed to any oil company in\nthe amount of any tax paid or assumed by, or passed through to such company\nwith respect to purchases of motor fuel billed a governmental entity exclusive\nof the motor fuel tax as described in subdivision (e) of this section. Records\nsufficient to substantiate all exemptions and any refund or credit claimed on\nthe basis of such exemptions must be maintained by the seller. (See Part 415 of\nthis Title for refunds, credits and reimbursements.)\n(2)\nA registered distributor must report\nmotor fuel sold to a governmental entity in its monthly return of tax on motor\nfuels and may deduct the quantity so sold in arriving at the net taxable\ngallonage to the extent such fuel was sold without passing through to such\nentity the motor fuel tax.
