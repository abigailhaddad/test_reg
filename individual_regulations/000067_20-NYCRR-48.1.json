  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 48.1 - Returns\n\nState Regulations\n\nUtilities reporting either gross income or gross operating\nincome are required to file returns. Question 72: How often must returns be filed?\nAnswer: On or before the 25th day of September, December, March and June for the three\ncalendar months preceding each such return date. However, any utility whose\naverage gross income or gross operating income, as the case may be, for the\nfour quarterly periods preceding June 25 in any year is less than $1,500 may\nfile an annual return on or before June 25 for the 12 preceding calendar\nmonths. Any utility whose gross income or gross operating income, as the case\nmay be, for any 12 months' period ending May 31, is less than $500 must file an\nannual return on or before June 25 for the 12 preceding calendar months. Question 73: In whose name are returns required to be filed?\nAnswer: Returns are required to be filed in the name of the\nutility subject to tax but may be verified by its duly authorized agent. Question 74: Many utilities have meter-reading periods which do not\ncoincide with the calendar month. How do such utilities report?\nAnswer: Such utilities may either (a) prorate receipts from\nsales made or services rendered to conform to the period covered by the return\nor (b) include in their returns receipts from sales made or services rendered\nduring their usual meter-reading periods. Regardless of the method adopted, receipts from sales made or services rendered for 365 days of each year must be\nincluded in returns. Question 75: May a utility, not subject to supervision by the State\n\nDepartment of Public Service, which owns or operates several properties, file a\nseparate return stating the gross operating income derived from one or more of\nsuch properties?\nAnswer: Yes, if it secures the written\napproval of the State Tax Commission. Such approval may be secured upon\napplication by the utility, made upon the form and containing the information\nprescribed by the State Tax Commission. Any change in the number of properties\nin which utility services are furnished, after approval to file separate\nreturns has been secured, is required to be promptly reported to the State Tax\n\nCommission.
