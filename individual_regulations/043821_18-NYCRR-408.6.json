  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 408.6 - Length of stay in a residential program for victims of domestic violence\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\nrequirements. A resident's initial authorized length of stay at a\nresidential program for victims of domestic violence and eligibility for any\nextensions must be based upon the individual safety and service needs of the\nresident or the resident's children. (b) Method of determining length of\nstay. (1)\nA resident's initial length\nof stay will be authorized for a period of up to 90 days, determined by the\nsocial services district financially responsible for the resident at the time\nof admission, based upon the individual safety and service needs of the\nresident or the resident's children. (2)\nA resident's eligibility for an extension\nwill be assessed as follows: (i) A resident's\nlength of stay may be extended a maximum of two times. Each extension may be up\nto 45 days contiguous to the initial 90-day period and must be based upon a\ndetermination by the social services district that: (a) such housing is necessary; and\n(b) neither the resident, the social services\ndistrict nor the residential program are able to secure safe and appropriate\nalternative housing, as defined in section\n408.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (ii)\n\nThe\nresidential program must request an extension of the length of stay prior to\nthe expiration of the resident's length of stay. Such request for extension\nshall be made to the social service district fiscally responsible for the\nresident no fewer than five business days prior to the expiration of the\nresident's length of stay. The social service district fiscally responsible for\nthe resident may agree to a shorter notice period only if emergency\ncircumstances make the need for such an extension not reasonably foreseeable in\nthe notice period set forth above. In such a case, notice of the extension must\nbe given to the social service district immediately upon circumstance becoming\nreasonably foreseeable. Whenever a resident's length of stay is extended, the\nsocial services district financially responsible for the resident must assist\nthe resident in obtaining alternative housing before the close of the extension\nperiod. (iii)\n\nWhen a resident is\nunable to secure safe and appropriate alternative housing and is deemed\neligible to remain in a residential program, the social services district\nfinancially responsible for the resident must pay the per diem rate for the\nresidential program for the period of such extension. (iv)\n\nThe resident's need for an extension\nmust be assessed pursuant to the following standards: (a) the resident must continue to be in need\nof temporary shelter and emergency services provided directly by the\nresidential program pursuant to sections\n453.4, 454.7\nor\n455.6\nof this Title because safe\nand appropriate alternative housing, as defined in section\n408.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart, is not available; (b) the\nresident must continue to meet the admission criteria of the residential\nprogram pursuant to section\n452.9\n(a) and, where applicable, sections 454.6 and\n455.5\nof this Title; and\n(c) the resident must continue to abide by\nthe rules of the residential program. (c) Assessment of service\nneeds. (1)\n\nGeneral requirements. (i) During the period of stay at a\nresidential program, each resident's need for temporary shelter, emergency\nservices and care, including the individual safety and service needs of a\nresident and the resident's children must be assessed at regular intervals to\nensure the provision of necessary and appropriate services to a resident and\nhis/her children. At a minimum, such assessment must include an evaluation of\nthe need for services provided directly by a residential program and any\nservices provided directly by a social services district. Unless there is a\ncontract between the residential program and the district pursuant to section\n408.8\nof this Part, the social\nservices district financially responsible for the resident will determine the\nprocedures for conducting such assessments. (ii)\n\nTo ensure that a resident's temporary\nshelter, emergency services and care needs assessment identifies all the\nservice needs of the resident and his/her children, including those services\noffered and provided directly by a social services district, a residential\nprogram must provide the social services district financially responsible for\nthe resident with relevant information concerning the resident's temporary\nshelter, emergency services and care. (2)\n\nFrequency of assessments. The frequency at which a resident's temporary shelter, emergency services and care needs must be assessed by a residential program\nmust be determined by the social services district financially responsible for\nthe resident, unless there is a contract between such district and the\nresidential program, in which case the frequency will be determined pursuant to\nthe terms of the contract.
