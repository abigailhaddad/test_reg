  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 176.10 - Aviation fueling\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nFuel handling. (i) Aircraft shall not be engaged in fuel\nhandling in an area where aircraft engines are operating, aircraft or engines\nare being warmed by application of heat, or while the aircraft is located in a\ncongested area. (ii)\nA properly\ntrained person shall be present and responsive while fuel is being transferred\ninto or out of any fuel storage facility (from or into refueling vehicle). (a) The person shall remain within the\nimmediate vicinity, in close proximity to, and in direct view of all operating\ncontrols and refueling vehicles. (b) The person shall not leave the discharge\nend of any hose(s) unattended at any time while the transfer of fuel is in\nprogress. (c) The person shall not\nblock open, disengage, or deactivate the \"deadman\" or any related controls\nwhile fuel handling. (iii)\n\nAll fuel handling\nshall be treated with due caution and circumspection with regard to the rights, safety, and security of others so as not to endanger, or be likely to endanger, persons or property. (iv)\n\nPersons\nengaged in fuel handling shall exercise care and extreme caution to prevent\noverflow or spills of fuel or oils. (a) Should\na fuel or oil spill occur at the airport, the party responsible shall\nfully comply with section\n176.3\n(p) of this\n\nPart. (v) Refueling vehicles shall be positioned so the vehicle can be directly\ndriven\naway from the loading or refueling position in the event of\nspill or fire. (vi)\n\nFuel handling shall be conducted\noutdoors and at least 25 feet from any\nhangar or building and 50 feet from any combustion and\nventilation air-intake to\nany boiler, heater, or incinerator room or as approved by the\nauthority and the\nfire department. (vii)\n\nVehicles shall be refueled only at\nrefueling stations and from dispensing\ndevices approved by the authority and the fire\ndepartment. (viii)\n\nIn the\nabsence of suitable ground support equipment, a turbine-powered\nauxiliary power unit mounted at the rear of the aircraft or\non the wing on the side\nopposite from the fueling point may be operated during fuel\nhandling. (a) A turbine-powered\nauxiliary power unit may be operated during fuel handling provided its design, installation, location, and combustion air source do not constitute a fuel\nvapor ignition source. (b) Fuel\nhandling shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the\naircraft operator's manual. (ix)\n\nFuel handling shall not occur if an\nelectrical storm is in progress in the immediate vicinity of the airport. (a) Fuel handling may resume 15 minutes\nfollowing any reported or\nobserved lightning flash within 5 miles of the airport. (x)\n\nThe refueling vehicle shall be bonded to the aircraft or fuel storage facility\nto equalize the voltage potential. (a) All hoses, nozzles, spouts, funnels, and\nappurtenances used in fuel\nhandling shall be FM or UL approved and shall be equipped\nwith a bonding\ndevice to prevent ignition of volatile liquids. (xi)\n\nRefueling vehicles shall not be operated in reverse unless another trained\nperson is present to safely monitor and direct the movement of the refueling\nvehicle. (xii)\n\nFuel handling shall not\noccur while passengers are on board the aircraft unless a passenger-loading\nramp is in place at the aircraft's cabin door, the door is in the open\nposition, and a qualified attendant is present at the door. (xiii) No person\nshall operate any radio transmitter or receiver or switch it on or off during\nfuel handling unless said radio transmitter or receiver is designed\nspecifically for such environment. (xiv)\n\nNo person shall operate aircraft\nelectrical systems or switch aircraft electrical appliances on or off during\nfuel handling. (xv)\n\nHold down or\nhold open devices on refueling vehicle nozzles are prohibited. (xvi) For single\npoint fueling, \"deadman\" controls or mechanisms shall be utilized and shall\nremain in safe operating condition and good working order. (a) No person shall deactivate or bypass a\n\"deadman\" control or\nmechanism at any time. (xvii) During fuel handling, no person\nshall use any material or equipment which is likely to cause a spark or\nignition within 50 feet. (a) Smoking, matches, lighters, and open\nflames\n(e.g., candles, fixtures, or\nfires)\nare prohibited within 50 feet of any\naircraft, refueling vehicle, or fuel\nstorage facility. (xviii) Refueling vehicles (including fuel\ntankers) shall only use the entrance, exit, and route designated by the\nauthority during the transportation and delivery of fuel. (xix)\n\nRefueling vehicles (including fuel\ntankers) shall be subject to inspection at any time to determine compliance\nwith these rules and regulations. (xx) The authority assumes no liability or\nresponsibility for any violation of any aircraft, refueling vehicle or\nrefueling requirement or procedure, any error, omission, negligence, or any\nviolation of any regulatory measure relating to fuel handling. (a) Entities engaged in fuel handling shall\nbe solely, fully, and completely responsible for any such violation, error, omission, or negligence incident to or in connection with the entities fuel\nstorage facilities, refueling vehicles, fuel handling, and training. (b) Entities engaged in fuel handling shall\nreimburse the authority for any fines, legal or court costs, incurred by the\nauthority for any such violation, error, omission, or negligence. (2)\n\nRotorcraft rapid\nrefueling. (i) Only turbine engine rotorcraft\nfueled with jet fuel shall be permitted to be\nfueled while an onboard engine is operating. All sources of\nignition must be\nlocated above the fuel inlet port(s), vents or tank\nopenings. (ii)\n\nAn\nFAA-licensed rotorcraft pilot shall be at the rotorcraft controls during the\nentire fuel handling process. (iii)\n\nIf applicable, medical crew members\nshall be ready to remove the patient\nfrom the rotorcraft to a safe area in the event of a fuel\nhandling accident. (iv)\n\nOnly designated personnel, properly trained in rapid refueling operations, shall operate the refueling vehicle. (v) All doors, windows, and access points\nallowing entry to the interior of the\nrotorcraft which are adjacent to, or in the immediate\nvicinity of, the fuel inlet ports\nshall be closed and shall remain closed during fuel\nhandling. (vi)\n\nFuel shall\nbe dispensed into an open port from approved dead-man type\nnozzles, with a flow rate not to exceed 60 gallons per minute\nor it shall be\ndispensed through close-coupled pressure fueling\nports. (vii)\n\nWhen fuel is\ndispensed from fixed piping systems the hose cabinet shall not\nextend into the rotor space. (viii)\n\nThe refueling vehicle shall be\npre-positioned in a designated area and the\nrotorcraft will land after the refueling vehicle has been\nparked and the wheels\nchocked (maintaining no less than 20 feet between any\nrotorcraft rotating\ncomponent and the refueling vehicle). The refueling vehicle\nshall not be moved\nor relocated while the rotorcraft is on the ground or\nhovering near-by. (3)\n\nStorage of refueling vehicles. (i) Refueling vehicles shall be stored\noutdoors and not less than 50 feet from a building or at the distance approved\nby the fire department unless the building is designed, constructed, and used\nexclusively, and approved by the fire\ndepartment specifically for this purpose. (ii)\n\nRefueling vehicles shall be parked in a\nmanner that provides a minimum of 10 feet of separation between vehicles and\nany other vehicle or aircraft and a minimum of 20 feet from a storm water\ninlet. (4)\n\nMaintenance\nof refueling vehicles. (i) Maintenance of\nrefueling vehicles shall be performed outdoors or in a building which is\napproved by the fire department specifically for this purpose. (ii)\n\nEntities engaged in fuel handling shall\ndocument and maintain and keep on file refueling vehicle maintenance records. These records shall be made available to the authority upon request. (5)\n\nFuel storage facilities. (i) All security gates leading into fuel\nstorage facilities shall remain (be kept) closed, locked, and secured except\nwhen actually in use. (b) Commercial fueling. Entities engaged in commercial fueling must be authorized to\nconduct commercial fueling operations under the minimum standards for\naeronautical services. (c) Non-commercial self-fueling. Entities engaged in non-commercial self-fueling shall comply\nwith the minimum standards for aeronautical\nservices. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n176.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
