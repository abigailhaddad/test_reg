  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 83.5 - Sharing of appreciation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Shared appreciation agreements may provide that the mortgagor shall share, in\naccordance with section\n83.6\nof this Part, in any\nappreciation in the value of the residential property with the holder in the\nevent of a sale or transfer of the residential property or any interest\ntherein, whether by deed, contract for deed or otherwise; including the\nfollowing cases: (1)\nsale or transfer for\nvalue that exceeds the outstanding principal balance of the modified mortgage\nloan; (ii)\ntaking of the residential property\nby eminent domain where payment is made for the full value of the property; or\n(iii)\ncasualty loss where the\nproceeds of the claim are used to repay the principal of the modified mortgage\nloan. (b) The\nfollowing cases do not necessitate a sharing, nor do they extinguish a holder's\nclaim to a share of the appreciation in value upon a subsequent sale or\ntransfer: (1)\nthe creation of a lien or other\nencumbrance subordinate to the holder's security instrument, which does not\nrelate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the residential\nproperty; (2)\nthe creation of a\npurchase money security interest for household appliances; (3)\na transfer by devise, descent, or\noperation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the\nentirety; (4)\nthe granting of a\nleasehold interest; provided, however, the leasehold interest is not for a\nperiod longer than the period permitted to pay off the modified mortgage loan, and the lease does not provide the lessee with an option to purchase; (5)\na transfer to a relative resulting from\nthe death of a mortgagor; (6)\na\ntransfer where the spouse or children of the mortgagor become an owner of the\nresidential property; (7)\na\ntransfer resulting from a decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation\nagreement, or from an incidental property settlement agreement, by which the\nspouse or former spouse of the mortgagor becomes an owner of the residential\nproperty; (8)\na transfer into an\ninter vivos\ntrust in which the mortgagor is and remains a\nbeneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in\nthe residential property; or\n(9)\nany other transfer or disposition permissible by Federal regulation as not\ntriggering a due-on-sale clause. (c) The following cases do not prevent a\nholder from sharing in any appreciation; rather, each entitles the holder to\ncollect the aggregate principal balance, including the principal reduction and\ninterest thereon, calculated at the modified note rate from the date of the\nshared appreciation agreement to the date of consummation of the transaction: (1)\na refinancing or other satisfaction in\nfull of the modified mortgage loan, which is not in connection with a sale or\ntransfer of the residential property or any interest therein; or\n(2)\na sale or transfer of the residential\nproperty or any interest therein, which occurs within one year of the execution\nof the modified mortgage loan.
