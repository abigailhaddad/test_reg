(h) Those requests determined to be ineligible for external appeal shall be returned to the enrollee or, in the case of a provider initiated retrospective appeal, the enrollee's health care provider, by the superintendent, with notification to the enrollee's health care plan and attending physician, as appropriate, accompanied by an explanation as to why the request was determined to be ineligible for external appeal within seven days of receipt of a complete request for a standard appeal and within 48 hours of receipt of a complete request for an expedited appeal.
