(1)\n\nFor housing\naccommodations other than hotels, upon the renting of a vacant housing\naccommodation, the owner shall provide to the tenant a copy of the fully\nexecuted lease for a one- or two-year term, at the tenant's option (except\nwhere a mortgage or mortgage commitment existing as of April 1, 1969 prohibits\nthe granting of one-year lease terms), bearing the signature of the owner and\ntenant and the beginning and ending dates of the lease term, within 30 days\nfrom the owner's receipt of the vacancy lease signed by the tenant. Such lease\nshall conform to the intent of section\n5-702\nof the General Obligations Law (plain English). The rent provided therein may\nnot exceed the last legal regulated rent in addition to all increases\nauthorized by this code. For a housing accommodation subject to the City Rent\n\nLaw which becomes vacant after March 31, 1984, the owner may not increase the\nrent charged in the initial lease or other rental agreement pursuant to annual\nguidelines for a period of one year or until the expiration date of the initial\nlease or rental agreement, whichever is later. (2)\n\nFor housing accommodations in hotels\nrented to an occupant who has never had a lease, such occupant may at any time\nduring his or her occupancy request a lease and the owner must, within 15 days\nafter such request, grant a lease commencing on the date such request was made\nat a rent which does not exceed the legal regulated rent, for a term of at\nleast six months. The hotel occupant who requests such a lease becomes a\npermanent tenant but the lease need not be renewed. Notwithstanding the above, an owner shall not refuse to grant a lease or to extend or continue a tenancy\nin order to prevent the hotel occupant from becoming a permanent tenant, except\nto the extent that the owner may be permitted to do so by law pursuant to a\nwarrant of eviction, or other order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or a\ngovernmental vacate order. (3)\n\nIn\naddition, where a hotel occupant has not requested a lease, an owner shall not\nrefuse to extend or continue a tenancy solely in order to prevent the hotel\noccupant from becoming a permanent tenant. (b) Renewal lease. (1)\n\nFor housing accommodations other than\nhotels, upon such notice as is required by section\n2523.5\nof this Title, the tenant\nshall have the right of selecting at his or her option a renewal of his or her\nlease for a one- or two-year term; except that where a mortgage or a mortgage\ncommitment existing as of April 1, 1969 prohibits the granting of one- year\nlease terms or the tenant is the recipient of a Senior Citizen Rent Increase\n\nExemption pursuant to section 26-509 of the Administrative code of the City of\n\nNew York, the tenant may not select a one-year lease. The owner shall furnish\nto the tenant signing a renewal lease form, pursuant to section\n2523.5\nof this Title, a copy of the\nfully executed renewal lease form, bearing the signatures of the owner and\ntenant, and the beginning and ending dates of the lease term, within 30 days\nfrom the owner's receipt of the renewal lease form signed by the tenant. Such\nrenewal lease form shall conform to the intent of section\n5-702\nof the General Obligations Law. (2)\n\nUpon complaint by the tenant that he or she was not served with a copy of the\nfully executed vacancy lease or renewal lease form pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (a) or paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the DHCR shall order the\nowner to furnish the copy of the vacancy lease or renewal lease form. In\naddition to any other penalties provided under this code, noncompliance by the\nowner within 20 days of such order shall result in the denial of any rent\nguideline increases for vacancy or renewal leases until the fully executed copy\nof the vacancy lease or renewal lease form is furnished by the owner to the\ntenant. (c) Lease rider\nand notice of rights. (1)\n\nFor housing\naccommodations subject to this code, an owner shall furnish to each tenant\nsigning a vacancy or renewal lease, a rider in a form promulgated or approved\nby the DHCR, in larger type than the lease, describing the rights and duties of\nowners and tenants as provided for under the RSL including a detailed\ndescription in a format as prescribed by DHCR of how the rent was adjusted from\nthe prior legal rent. Such rider shall conform to the \"plain English\"\nrequirements of section\n5-702\nof the General Obligations Law. Copies of the form as promulgated by DHCR shall\nalso be available in all languages that may be required pursuant to DHCR's\nlanguage access plan. The rider shall be attached as an addendum to the lease. Upon the face of each lease, in bold print, in English and any other language\nas required by the DHCR language access plan, shall appear the following: \"ATTACHED RIDER SETS FORTH RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF TENANTS AND LANDLORDS\nUNDER THE RENT STABILIZATION LAW.\"\n(i) For\nvacancy leases, such rider shall in addition also include a notice of the prior\nlegal regulated rent, if any, which was in effect immediately prior to the\nvacancy, an explanation, and in a format prescribed by DHCR, how the rental\namount provided for in the vacancy lease has been computed above the amount\nshown in the most recent annual registration statement, as well as the prior\nlease, and a statement that any increase above the amount set forth in such\nregistration statement is in accordance with the adjustments permitted by the\nrent guidelines board and this code. (ii)\n\nSuch rider shall also set forth that the\ntenant may, within 60 days of the execution of the lease, require the owner to\nprovide the documentation directly to the tenant supporting the detailed\ndescription regarding the adjustment of the prior legal rent pursuant to\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. The owner shall provide such documentation\nwithin thirty days of that request. (iii)\n\nThe method of service of the lease\nrider, the tenant request for documentation, and the owner's provision of\ndocumentation, together with proof of same, shall conform to the requirements\nset forth in the lease rider itself or such other bulletin or document rendered\npursuant to section\n2527.11\nof this Title. (iv)\n\nFor renewal leases, such rider shall be\nattached to the form sent to the tenant pursuant to section\n2523.5\nof this Title. (2)\n\nFor housing accommodations in\nhotels, each owner shall furnish to each person, at the time of registration, a\n\nNotice of Rights in a form promulgated or approved by the DHCR, describing the\nrights and duties of hotel owners, occupants and tenants as provided for under\nthe RSL and this code and a hotel occupant's right to become a permanent tenant\nat a legal regulated rent by requesting a lease for a term of at least six\nmonths at any time during his or her occupancy. Such notice, which shall\nconform to the \"plain English\" requirements of section\n5-702\nof the General Obligations Law, shall also be available in Spanish. Such notice\nshall be provided to each hotel occupant in residence on the effective date of\nthis code no later than 90 days from such effective date. An owner who violates\nthe RSL and this code by failing to furnish this Notice of Rights, and/or by\nengaging in any conduct which compels a person to rent as a hotel occupant, prevents a hotel occupant from becoming a permanent tenant, or results in a\nhotel occupant vacating a housing accommodation, shall be subject to a loss of\na guidelines adjustment pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision as well\nas penalties pursuant to section\n2526.2\n(b) and\n(c)(1)\nof this Title, and may be subject to a\npenalty pursuant to section\n2526.2\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Title, in an amount no less than $1,000. (3)\n\nWhere a tenant, permanent tenant or hotel\noccupant is not furnished, as required by the above provision, with a copy of\nthe lease rider pursuant to paragraph (1), the notice pursuant to paragraph\n(2), or the documentation required on demand by paragraph (1)(ii) of this\nsubdivision, the owner shall not be entitled to collect any adjustments in\nexcess of the rent set forth in the prior lease unless the owner can establish\nthat the rent collected was otherwise legal. In addition to issuing an order\nwith respect to applicable overcharges, DHCR shall order the owner to furnish\nthe missing rider, notice, or documentation. The furnishing of the rider, notice, or documentation by the owner to the tenant or hotel occupant shall\nresult in the elimination, prospectively, of such penalty. With respect to\nhousing accommodations in hotels, noncompliance by the owner shall not prevent\nthe hotel occupant from becoming a permanent tenant. (d) Limitations. No provision may be made in\nany vacancy or renewal lease for adjustment of the legal regulated rent\nreserved in the lease except as follows: (1)\nif the applicable rent guidelines rate has not been fixed by the execution date\nof the vacancy lease or the renewal offer, the lease may make provision for the\nrent increase, if any, pursuant to the said rate when filed, to become\neffective as of the commencement date of the lease term, unless the rent\nguidelines board shall have fixed a later effective date for the said rate, in\nwhich event the adjustment may only be effective as of the later\ndate; (2)\nwhere such lease provides\nthat the rental reserved therein may be increased pursuant to an order issued\nby the DHCR; or\n(3)\nwhere such\nlease provides that a rent increase shall be in the amount, if any, authorized\nby the DHCR in the event an application is filed to establish a hardship\npursuant to section\n2522.4\n(c) or (d)\nof this Part; and\n(4)\nin the case\nof a vacancy lease, where an application for a rent adjustment pursuant to\n2522.4(b), (c) or (d) of this Part is pending before the DHCR, such lease also\nrecites that such application is pending before the DHCR and the basis for the\nadjustment, and that the increase which is the subject of such application, if\ngranted, may be effective during the term of the lease. (e) Escalator clauses. (1)\n\nRegardless of whether an escalator clause\nwas contained in the last effective lease or other rental agreement prior to\n\nApril 1, 1984, no renewal lease or vacancy lease commencing on or after April\n1, 1984 shall provide for any escalator clause, except that nothing herein\nshall prohibit the use of escalator clauses otherwise required by any other\nstatute or regulation affecting the housing accommodation. (2)\n\nFor buildings receiving benefits pursuant\nto section\n421-a\nof the Real Property Tax Law and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, such clauses may provide for an annual or other periodic rent increase over the\ninitial rent at an average rate of not more than 2.2 percent of the amount of\nsuch initial rent per annum not to exceed the maximum cumulative amount, if\nany, permitted under the 421-a program rules and regulations. After the tax\nbenefits end, such additional 2.2 percent charges shall no longer be added but\nthe owner may continue to collect the cumulative 2.2 percent increases charged\nprior to the termination of said tax benefits. Any lease containing the\naforementioned provision shall also include a rider with an endorsement signed\nby the tenant acknowledging the owner's right to include such provision and to\ncollect such rent increase for the tax benefit period. Such rider shall state\nthe approximate date of the expiration of such tax benefits. (3)\n\nNothing in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision shall prohibit the inclusion of a lease provision for an annual or\nother periodic rent increase over the legal regulated rent at such rate of\nrental increase as is provided for and authorized by section\n423\nof\nthe Real Property Tax Law.

Any lease containing the\naforementioned provision shall also include a rider with an endorsement signed\nby the tenant acknowledging the owner's right to include such provision and to\ncollect such rent increase for the tax benefit period. Such rider shall state\nthe approximate date of the expiration of such tax benefits. (4)\n\nNo additional charge which became\neffective on or after November 19, 1982, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, shall become part of the legal regulated rent. (f) Same terms and conditions. (1)\n\nThe lease provided to the tenant by the\nowner pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section shall be on the same terms\nand conditions as the expired lease, except where the owner can demonstrate\nthat the change is necessary in order to comply with a specific requirement of\nlaw or regulation applicable to the building or to leases for housing\naccommodations subject to the RSL, or with the approval of the DHCR. Nothing\nherein may limit the inclusion of authorized clauses otherwise permitted by\nthis Code or by order of the DHCR not contained in the expiring lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tenant shall have the right to have his or\nher spouse or domestic partner added to the lease or any renewal thereof as an\nadditional tenant where said spouse or domestic partner resides in the housing\naccommodation as his or her primary residence. (g) Leases for housing accommodations in\ncooperative or condominium-owned buildings shall be governed as follows: (1)\n\nAn owner of one or more housing\naccommodations subject to this Code may evict the tenant of such housing\naccommodation and/or refuse to renew a lease therefor, if such housing\naccommodation is in a building, group of buildings or development which is the\nsubject of an Eviction Plan for conversion to cooperative or condominium\nownership under General Business Law, section 352-eeee (hereinafter \"section\n352-eeee\"), provided: (i) the Attorney\n\nGeneral has accepted for filing a plan to convert the building, group of\nbuildings or development to cooperative or condominium ownership and an\namendment declaring the plan effective as an Eviction Plan has been accepted\nfor filing and a closingh as been held thereunder; and\n(ii)\nthree years have elapsed from the date\non which the Attorney General has accepted for filing an amendment declaring\nthe plan effective as an Eviction Plan, and at such time or there after the\ntenant's lease has expired or has been cancelled pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision. (2)\nA\ntenant in occupancy of a housing accommodation subject to this Code shall have\nthe right to a renewal lease or in the case of a permanent tenant, to continue\nhis or her tenancy on the terms and conditions and at the rent and adjustments\nthereto as otherwise provided for in this Code. (3)\n\nFor the purposes of this section, filing\ndate shall mean the date on which a letter was issued by the Attorney General\naccepting a plan for filing. (4)\n\nAfter the filing date, and prior to the plan being declared effective, if a\nhousing accommodation subject to this Code is vacated, such housing\naccommodation may only be rented at a rent and upon such terms and conditions\nas are authorized under this Code for a vacancy lease. Notwith standing the\nforegoing, if a vacancy lease herein called an interim lease for such housing\naccommodation is executed in connection with an agreement to purchase such\nhousing accommodation or the shares allocated thereto, pursuant to any Eviction\n\nPlan or Non-Eviction Plan, as defined by section 352-eeee, such interim lease: (i) may provide that once the plan has been\ndeclared effective, if the tenant fails to purchase his or her housing\naccommodation or the shares allocated thereto on the terms set forth in the\nsubscription or purchase agreement, or otherwise terminates or defaults on the\nsubscription or purchase agreement, such tenant may be evicted; and\n(ii)\nmay provide for a rental below the legal\nregulated rent which shall not, upon the abandonment or withdrawal of the plan, be increased to the legal regulated rent. If the plan is abandoned or\nwithdrawn, such tenant remains a rent-stabilized tenant. (5)\n\nIf a housing accommodation which was\nsubject to this Code is vacated or is rented to a new tenant after any plan\nwhich affects such housing accommodation has been declared effective, and a\nclosing thereunder has occurred, such housing accommodation shall not be\nsubject to this Code. (6)\n\nIf a\nbuilding, group of buildings or development containing units to which this Code\napplies is converted to cooperative or condominium ownership, the services\nwhich shall be required to be maintained under this Code with respect to\nhousing accommodations which remain subject to this Code shall not be\ndiminished or modified without the approval of the DHCR as provided for in\nsection\n2522.4\n(e) or (f)\nof this Part.
