  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 471.3 - Government motor vehicles\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 504, subd. 2. (a) Motor vehicles operated by the United\n\nStates, New York State, or any other State, or by any county, city, town or\nmunicipality in New York State or any other State or by any agency or\ndepartment thereof are exempt from the statute. (b) If a motor vehicle is operated by a\nprivate person although owned by one of the foregoing it is not exempt and must\nhave a permit. Thus a motor vehicle owned by one of the foregoing governments, agencies or departments which is leased to a private contractor is not exempt. Similarly a motor vehicle operated by a private person under a contract with\nany of the foregoing governments, agencies or departments is not\nexempt. (c) However, if a motor\nvehicle is operated by one of the foregoing governments, agencies or\ndepartments, it is exempt from the statute even if owned by a private person. Example 1: A contractor having a cost-plus contract with the United\n\nStates owns a motor vehicle which he operates in connection with such contract. The motor vehicle is required to have a permit. Example 2: A county leases a truck from a private person and the\ntruck is operated by a county employee for purposes of snow removal. It is\nexempt from the statute when so used. Example 3: A county enters into an agreement with a contractor for\nthe removal of snow from its highways under which the contractor furnishes the\ntruck and the driver. The truck is not exempt.
