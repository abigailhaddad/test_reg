  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.18 - Checking accounts for the account of fiduciaries; checking accounts in the form of totten trusts\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked whether an individual serving as a\nfiduciary under a will or trust instrument may open a checking account at a\n\nState-chartered savings bank or savings and loan association. The department\nwas also asked whether an individual may open a checking account in the form of\na \"totten trust\". The department responded that an individual fiduciary for an\nindividual beneficiary could maintain a demand deposit at a mutual institution, if such trust is not for a business purpose and subject to compliance with\n\nBanking Law Section 237.1. The department also replied that demand deposits\ncould be maintained in the form of totten trusts. Section 237.2 of the Banking Law, as recently amended, prohibits a savings bank from accepting \"any deposit for credit to a municipal\ncorporation or for credit to any partnership, corporation, association or other\norganization for profit, or any demand deposit for credit to any depositor\nexcept a natural person\". Section 380.13 of the Banking Law, as amended, imposes a similar restriction upon savings and loan associations. The quoted language would cleraly prohibit a corporate\nfiduciary from opening a checking account at a mutual institution. It would\nalso prohibit an individual who serves as trustee for a corporate account from\nopening a checking account, since the corporation would be the beneficial owner\nof the funds. The issue, therefore, is whether the language quoted would permit\nan individual serving as a fiduciary for another individual to open a checking\naccount at a mutual institution. This, in turn, depends upon the Legislature's\nintent when it adopted Sections 237.2 and 380.13 of the Banking Law. Sections\n237.2 and 380.13 were enacted by Chapter 225 of the Laws of 1976. The language\nof the two sections was derived, in large measure, from the language contained\nin A. 11147/S. 8626, which was a Banking Department bill which included\nchecking as well as personal loan powers. During the Legislature's\nconsideration of A. 11147 and of A. 12452-A, which was subsequently enacted as\n\nChapter 225 of the Laws of 1976, the Banking Department repeatedly emphasized\nthat the bills would not affect the commercial banks' monopoly on commercial\nchecking accounts and that the bills were not intended to permit mutual\ninstitutions to offer checking accounts for business or commercial uses. The\ndepartment also stated that checking account powers would further the\nrestructuring of the thrift industry and would be the first of the steps\nnecessary toward the transformation of thrift institutions into family banking\ncenters. An examination of relevant provisions of law suggests that\ncertain trusts do not constitute business instruments and that the trustees of\nthose trusts may open a checking account with a mutual institution without\nviolating the purpose of Section 237.2, as understood by the Legislature. More\nspecifically: 1. A checking account in\nthe name of the trustee for a non-business trust is compatible with--and\nfurthers--the concept of the mutual institution as a family banking\ncenter. 2. As indicated above, Section 237.2 of the Banking Law prohibits savings banks from accepting\ndeposits from municipal corporations, partnerships, corporations and other\norganizations for profit and, in the case of demand deposits, from any person\nother than a natural person. The section does not include trusts or trustees\nwithin its language. Construing \"natural person\" in such a way as to include\nindividuals who serve as fiduciaries for non-business trusts would be\nconsistent with such other subdivisions of Section 237, as subdivision (1). Former subdivision 1 of Section 237, repealed in 1971, set a\nceiling on the amount of deposit which a savings bank could accept from \"any\nperson\". The statute excluded certain sums from such deposits, including\n\"\n(b) All amounts credited to him as\ntrustee under a voluntary trust, unless the aggregate of all such amounts, exclusive of dividends or interest, is in excess of twenty-five thousand\ndollars in which event not more than twenty-five thousand dollars may be\nexcluded. (c) All amounts standing\nto his credit as executor, administrator, trustee, committee or guardian, named\nin a will or appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction.\"\nAt the time former subdivision 1 was repealed, subdivision 2\nof Section 237 was renumbered subdivision 1. The renumbered subdivision 1\nspecifically permits certain kinds of trustees to open an account in the name\nof the trustee. The subdivision reads as follows: \"No savings bank shall accept any deposit for credit to any\nexecutor, administrator, trustee, committee or guardian, named in a will or\nappointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, unless a certified copy of the\nwill, order or decree of the court authorizing such deposits or appointing such\nexecutor, administrator, trustee, committee or guardian, or a certificate of\nsuch appointment is filed with the savings bank.\"\nPresumably, the current version of subdivision 1 of Section\n237 was retained to insure that trust funds be counted separately, as provided\nin former subdivision 1 of Section 237. 3. Subdivision 4 of Section 237 permits a\nsavings bank to accept deposits of moneys paid as security for the performance\nof a lease regardless of the fact that the person depositing such moneys may be\ndeemed to be a trustee of trust funds. While one might argue, on the basis of\nthe existence of subdivision 4, that acceptance of any deposit from a trustee\nrequires specific authorization, a close reading of subdivision 4 indicates\nthat it was added to the law in order to permit lessors to deposit the security\ndeposits they received with a savings institution, regardless of whether the\nlessor or the lessee is a corporation, partnership, association or other\norganization for profit. Stated otherwise, Section 237.4 creates an exception\nto Section 237.2 and permits a mutual institution to accept a deposit from a\ncorporate or other entity if the deposit is a security deposit. 4. As noted earlier, Section 237.1 requires\nany individual who serves as trustee and who wishes to deposit funds with a\nsavings bank to file a certified copy of the instrument appointing the\ndepositor as fiduciary. This requirement would have to be met by any fiduciary\nwho seeks to open a checking account. An examination of the instrument filed\nmay reveal the purpose of the trust. If not, the bank should require a sworn\nstatement from the fiduciary to the effect that the trust was not established\nfor a business purpose. 5. Section\n27\nof\nthe General Construction Law defines \"person\" to include a corporation, a\njoint-stock association and, under certain circumstances, a state, government\nor country. The use of the term \"natural person\" in Section 237.2 makes it\nclear that the reference is to a human being rather than a legal entity. Although the definition of \"person\" does not refer to a fiduciary, this was not\ndone to disqualify fiduciaries from the benefits otherwise available to\n\"persons\" under the law. Instead, the reference to trustees and other\nfiduciaries in Section 237 and the absence of other special mention of\nfiduciaries indicates that the Legislature contemplated that fiduciaries would\nbe considered \"persons\" but would be subject to certain special requirements. In view of the foregoing, the department concluded that an individual serving\nas fiduciary for an individual beneficiary may open a demand deposit account at\na mutual institution, subject, however, to compliance with Section 237.1 (made\napplicable to savings and loan associations by Section 380.18). The department\nfurther concluded that demand deposits could be opened and maintained in the\nform of totten trusts. DATED: November 1976\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
