  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.8 - Financial requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe\nrequirements of subdivisions (c), (d), (h) and (i) of this section and section\n373-2.8\n(j) of this\n\nPart apply to owners and operators of all hazardous waste facilities, except as\nprovided otherwise in this section or in section\n373-3.1\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nThe requirements of subdivisions (e) and\n(f) of this section apply only to owners and operators of: (i) disposal facilities; (ii)\ntank systems that are required under\nsection\n373-3.10\n(h) of\nthis Subpart to meet the requirements for landfills; and\n(iii)\ncontainment buildings that are required\nunder section\n373-3.30\n(c) of\nthis Subpart to meet the requirements for landfills. (3)\n\nStates and the Federal government are\nexempt from the requirements of this section. (4)\n\nThe department may replace all or part of\nthe requirements of this section applying to a regulated unit with alternative\nrequirements for financial assurance set out in the permit or in an enforceable\ndocument (as defined in section\n373-1.2\n[e][3]\nof\nthis Part), where the department: (i) prescribes alternative requirements for the regulated unit under sections\n373-3.6\nand/or 373-3.7(a)(4) of\nthis Subpart; and\n(ii)\ndetermines\nthat it is not necessary to apply the requirements of this section because the\nalternative financial assurance requirements will protect human health and the\nenvironment. (b) Definitions of terms as used in\nthis section. (1)\n\nClosure\nplan\nmeans the plan for closure prepared in accordance with the\nrequirements of section\n373-3.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nCurrent\nclosure cost estimate\nmeans the most recent of the estimates prepared\nin accordance with paragraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) of this section. (3)\n\nCurrent post-closure cost\nestimate\nmeans the most recent of the estimates prepared in accordance\nwith paragraphs (e)(1), (2) and (3) of this section. (4)\n\nParent corporation\nmeans\na corporation which directly owns at least 50 percent of the voting stock of\nthe corporation which is the facility owner or operator; the latter corporation\nis deemed a subsidiary of the parent corporation. (5)\n\nPost-closure plan\nmeans\nthe plan for post-closure care prepared in accordance with the requirements of\nsection\n373-3.7\n(g)-(j)\nof\nthis Subpart. (6)\n\nRevenue-oriented, or\nrevenue-oriented hazardous waste\nmanagement facility, means any facility (as defined in section\n27-0917[7] of the ECL or 6 NYCRR\n370.2\n[b]) for which a majority of both its\noperating revenues and profits after tax at that facility for the prior three\nyears and for the current and next year have been and are expected to be\nattributable to the transportation, storing, handling, disposal, treatment or\nmanagement of solid and hazardous wastes or related activities or to the\nownership of or leasehold or other interest in any persons, facilities or other\nassets engaged in or used for such activities. In making such calculations\nunder this provision, all sources of operating revenues and profits (both\nbefore and after tax) shall be included. The commissioner may request any\nperson to show to the satisfaction of the commissioner, that the facility is\nnot a revenue-oriented hazardous waste management facility by this definition. The commissioner may require a person to present its statements of account, independently audited by a certified public accountant, and other records to\nmake this showing. (7)\n\nThe\nfollowing terms are used in the specifications for the financial tests for\nclosure, post-closure care and liability coverage. The definitions are intended\nto assist in the understanding of these regulations and are not intended to\nlimit the meanings of terms in a way that conflicts with generally accepted\naccounting practices. (i) Assets\nmeans all existing and all probable future economic\nbenefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity. (ii)\n\nCurrent assets\nmeans\ncash or other assets or resources commonly identified as those which are\nreasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the\nnormal operating cycle of the business. (iii)\n\nCurrent liabilities\nmeans obligations whose liquidation is reasonably expected to require the use\nof existing resources properly classifiable as current assets or the creation\nof other current liabilities. (iv)\n\nCurrent plugging and abandonment cost estimate\nmeans the most\nrecent of the estimates prepared in accordance with\n40 CFR\n144.62\n(see section 370.1[e] of this\n\nTitle). (v) Independently\naudited\nrefers to an audit performed by an independent certified\npublic accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing\nstandards. (vi)\n\nLiabilities\nmeans probable future sacrifices of economic\nbenefits arising from present obligations to transfer assets or provide\nservices to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or\nevents. (vii)\n\nNet working\ncapital\nmeans current assets minus current liabilities. (viii)\n\nNet worth\nmeans total\nassets minus total liabilities and is equivalent to owner's equity. (ix)\n\nTangible net worth\nmeans the tangible assets that remain after deducting liabilities; such assets\nwould not include intangibles such as good will and rights to patents or\nroyalties. (8)\n\nIn the\nliability insurance requirements the terms\nbodily injury\nand\nproperty damage\nshall have the meanings given these terms by\napplicable State law. However, these terms do not include those liabilities\nwhich, consistent with standard industry practices, are excluded from coverage\nin liability policies for bodily injury and property damage. The department\nintends the meanings of other terms used in the liability insurance\nrequirements to be consistent with their common meanings within the insurance\nindustry. The definitions given below of several of the terms are intended to\nassist in the understanding of these regulations and are not intended to limit\ntheir meanings in a way that conflicts with general insurance industry usage. (i) Accidental occurrence\nmeans an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended\nfrom the standpoint of the insured. (ii)\n\nLegal defense costs\nmeans any expenses that an insurer incurs in defending against claims of third\nparties brought under the terms and conditions of an insurance\npolicy. (iii)\n\nNonsudden\naccidental occurrence\nmeans an occurrence which takes place over time\nand involves continuous or repeated exposure. (iv)\n\nSudden accidental\noccurrence\nmeans an occurrence which is not continuous or repeated in\nnature. (9)\n\nSubstantial business relationship\nmeans the extent of a\nbusiness relationship necessary under applicable State law to make a guarantee\ncontract issued incident to that relationship valid and enforceable. A\nsubstantial business relationship must arise from a pattern of recent or\nongoing business transactions, in addition to the guarantee itself, such that a\ncurrently existing business relationship between the guarantor and the owner or\noperator is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner. (c) Cost estimates for\nfacility closure. (1)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must have a detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the cost\nof closing the facility in accordance with the requirements in section\n373-3.7\n(b)-(f)\nand\napplicable closure requirements in sections\n373-3.9\n(i), 373-3.10\n(e), 373-3.11\n(f), 373-3.12\n(g), 373-3.13\n(g), 373-3.14\n(d), 373-3.15\n(e), 373-3.16\n(e), 373-3.17\n(e) and\n373-3.30\n(c) of\nthis Subpart. (i) The estimate must equal the\ncost of final closure at the point in the facility's active life when the\nextent and manner of its operation would make closure the most expensive, as\nindicated by its closure plan (see section\n373-3.7\n[c] [2]\nof\nthis Subpart). (ii)\n\nThe closure\ncost estimate must be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a\nthird party to close the facility. A\nthird party\nis a party\nwho is neither a parent nor a subsidiary of the owner or operator. (See\ndefinition of parent corporation in subdivision [b] of this section.) The owner\nor operator may use costs for onsite disposal if the owner or operator can\ndemonstrate that onsite disposal capacity will exist at all times over the life\nof the facility. (iii)\n\nThe closure\ncost estimate may not incorporate any salvage value that may be realized with\nthe sale of hazardous wastes, or nonhazardous wastes if applicable under\nsection\n373-3.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart, facility structures or equipment, land or other assets associated\nwith the facility at the time of partial or final closure. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator may not\nincorporate a zero cost for hazardous wastes, or nonhazardous wastes if\napplicable under section\n373-3.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart, that might have economic value. (2)\n\nDuring the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must adjust the closure cost estimate for inflation\nwithin 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the establishment of the\nfinancial instruments used to comply with subdivision (d) of this section. For\nowners and operators using the financial test or guarantee, the closure cost\nestimate must be updated for inflation within 30 days after the close of the\nfirm's fiscal year and before submission of updated information to the\ncommissioner as specified in section\n373-3.8\n(d)(5)(iii)\nof this Subpart. The adjustment may be made by recalculating the maximum costs\nof closure in current dollars, or by using an inflation factor derived from the\nmost recent\n\nImplicit Price Deflator for Gross National Product\npublished by the U.S. Department of Commerce in its\n\nSurvey of Current\n\nBusiness, as specified in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph. The inflation factor is the result of dividing the latest published\nannual deflator by the deflator for the previous year. (i) The first adjustment is made by\nmultiplying the closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result is\nthe adjusted closure cost estimate. (ii)\n\nSubsequent adjustments are made by\nmultiplying the latest adjusted closure cost estimate by the latest inflation\nfactor. (3)\n\nDuring the\nactive life of the facility, the owner or operator must revise the closure cost\nestimate no later than 30 days after a revision has been made to the closure\nplan which increases the cost of closure. If the owner or operator has an\napproved closure plan, the closure cost estimate must be revised no later than\n30 days after the commissioner has approved the request to modify the closure\nplan, if the change in the closure plan increases the cost of closure. The\nrevised closure cost estimate must be adjusted for inflation as specified in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator must keep the\nfollowing at the facility during the operating life of the facility: the latest\nclosure cost estimate prepared in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (3) of\nthis subdivision and, when this estimate has been adjusted in accordance with\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, the latest adjusted closure cost\nestimate. (d) Financial assurance for facility closure. An owner or operator of each facility must establish\nfinancial assurance for closure of the facility. The owner or operator must\nchoose from the options as specified in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this\nsubdivision. An owner or operator may also use a combination of the options\nspecified in paragraphs (1) through (5) to provide the total amount of\nfinancial assurance for the closure of the facility. (1)\n\nClosure trust fund. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by establishing a closure trust fund which\nconforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally\nsigned duplicate of the trust agreement to the commissioner. The trustee must\nbe an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust\noperations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the trust agreement must\nbe identical to the wording specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(1)\nof\nthis Part, and the trust agreement must be accompanied by a formal\ncertification of acknowledgment (for example, see section\n373-2.8\n[j][1]\n). Schedule A of the trust agreement must be updated within 60 days after a change\nin the amount of the current closure cost estimate covered by the\nagreement. (iii)\n\nPayments into the\ntrust fund must be made annually by the owner or operator over the first five\nyears of operation or over the remaining operating life of the facility as\nestimated in the closure plan, whichever period is shorter; this period is\nhereinafter referred to as the \"pay-in period.\" The payments into the closure\ntrust fund must be made as follows: (a) For a\nnew or revenue-oriented facility, the first payment must be equal to the total\nclosure cost estimate, or an alternative mechanism must be provided which, when\ncombined with the trust fund, provides financial assurance for an amount at\nleast equal to the current closure cost estimate. For a revenue-oriented\nfacility, the first payment is due 90 days after the date that these\nregulations are promulgated. For a new facility, this payment will be made\nbefore the initial receipt of hazardous waste for treatment, storage or\ndisposal. (b) For an existing\nfacility which is not revenue-oriented, the first payment must be at least\nequal to the current closure cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision, divided by the number of years in the pay-in\nperiod. (c) Subsequent payments\nmust be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first\npayment. The amount of each subsequent payment must be determined by this\nformula: Next payment =CE-CV/Y\nWhere CE is the current closure cost estimate, CV is the\ncurrent value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in the\npay-in period. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator may accelerate\npayments into the trust fund or may deposit the full amount of the current\nclosure cost estimate at the time the fund is established. However, the owner\nor operator must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value that\nthe fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph. (v) If the\nowner or operator established a closure trust fund after having used one or\nmore alternate mechanisms specified in this subdivision, the first payment must\nbe in at least the amount that the fund would contain if the trust fund were\nestablished initially and annual payments made as specified in subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph. (vi)\n\nAfter\nthe pay-in period is completed or whenever the current closure cost estimate\nchanges, the owner or operator must compare the new estimate with the trustee's\nmost recent annual valuation of the trust fund. If the value of the fund is\nless than the amount of the new estimate, the owner or operator, within 60 days\nafter the change in the cost estimate, must either deposit an amount into the\nfund so that its value after this deposit at least equals the amount of the\ncurrent closure cost estimate, or obtain other financial assurance as specified\nin this subdivision to cover the difference. (vii)\n\nIf the value of the trust fund is\ngreater than the total amount of the current closure cost estimate, the owner\nor operator may submit a written request to the commissioner for release of the\namount in excess of the current closure cost estimate. (viii)\n\nIf an owner or operator substitutes\nother financial assurance as specified in this subdivision for all or part of\nthe trust fund, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the\ncommissioner for release of the amount in excess of the current closure cost\nestimate covered by the trust fund. (ix)\n\nWithin 60 days after receiving a request\nfrom the owner or operator for release of funds as specified in subparagraph\n(vii) or (viii) of this paragraph, the commissioner will instruct the trustee\nto release to the owner or operator such funds as the commissioner specifies in\nwriting. (x) After beginning\npartial or final closure, an owner or operator or another person authorized to\nconduct partial or final closure may request reimbursements for partial or\nfinal closure expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the commissioner. The owner or operator may request reimbursements for partial closure only if\nsufficient funds are remaining in the trust fund to cover the maximum costs of\nclosing the facility over its remaining operating life. Within 60 days after\nreceiving bills for partial or final closure activities, the commissioner will\ninstruct the trustee to make reimbursements in those amounts as the\ncommissioner specifies in writing, if the commissioner determines that the\npartial or final closure expenditures are in accordance with the approved\nclosure plan, or otherwise justified. If the commissioner has reason to believe\nthat the maximum cost of closure over the remaining life of the facility will\nbe significantly greater than the value of the trust fund, the commissioner may\nwithhold reimbursements of such amounts as he or she deems prudent until the\ncommisioner determines, in accordance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision, that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial\nassurance for final closure of the facility. If the commissioner does not\ninstruct the trustee to make such reimbursements, the commissioner will provide\nthe owner or operator with a detailed written statement of reasons. (xi)\n\nThe commissioner will agree to\ntermination of the trust when: (a) an owner or\noperator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision; or\n(b) the\ncommissioner releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this\nsubdivision in accordance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nSurety bond. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by obtaining a surety bond which conforms to\nthe requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the commissioner. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed\nas acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department\nof the Treasury. (ii)\n\nThe wording\nof the surety bond must be identical to the wording specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(2)\nof\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nThe owner or\noperator who uses a surety bond to satisfy the requirements of this subdivision\nmust also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the bond, all\npayments made thereunder will be deposited by the surety directly into the\nstandby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the commissioner. The\nstandby trust fund must meet the requirements specified in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, except that: (a) an\noriginally signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the\ncommissioner with the surety bond; and\n(b) until the standby trust fund is funded\npursuant to the requirements of this subdivision, the following are not\nrequired by these regulations: (1)\npayments\ninto the trust fund as specified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision; (2)\nupdating of\n\nSchedule A of the trust agreement (see section\n373-2.8\n[j][1]\nof\nthis Part) to show current closure cost estimates; (3)\nannual valuations as required by the\ntrust agreement; and\n(4)\nnotices of\nnonpayment as required by the trust agreement. (iv)\n\nThe bond must guarantee that the owner\nor operator will: (a) fund the standby trust\nfund in an amount equal to the penal sum of the bond before the beginning of\nfinal closure of the facility; or\n(b) fund the standby trust fund in an amount\nequal to the penal sum within 15 days after an order to begin final closure is\nissued by the commissioner or a United States district court or other court of\ncompetent jurisdiction; or\n(c) provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision, and\nobtain the commissioner's written approval of the assurance provided, within 90\ndays after receipt by both the owner or operator and the commissioner of a\nnotice of cancellation of the bond from the surety. (v) Under the terms of the bond, the surety\nwill become liable on the bond obligation when the owner or operator fails to\nperform as guaranteed by the bond. (vi)\n\nThe penal sum of the bond must be in an\namount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, except as provided\nin paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (vii)\n\nWhenever the current closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the penal sum, the owner or\noperator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the penal sum to\nbe increased to an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate\nand submit evidence of such increase to the commissioner, or obtain other\nfinancial assurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the current closure cost estimate decreases, the penal sum may be\nreduced to the amount of the current closure cost estimate following written\napproval by the commissioner. (viii)\n\nUnder the terms of the bond, the\nsurety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail, return receipt requested to the owner or operator and to the commissioner. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date\nof receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the\ncommissioner, as evidenced by the return receipts. (ix)\n\nThe owner or operator may cancel the\nbond if the commissioner has given prior written consent based on the receipt\nof evidence of alternate financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nClosure\nletter of credit. (i) An owner or operator\nmay satisfy the requirements of this subdivision by obtaining an irrevocable\nletter of credit which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and\nsubmitting the letter to the commissioner. The issuing institution must be an\nentity which has the authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter of\ncredit operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State\nagency. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the\nletter of credit must be identical to the wording specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(3)\nof\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nAn owner or\noperator who uses a letter of credit to satisfy the requirements of this\nsubdivision must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the\nletter of credit, all amounts paid pursuant to a draft by the commissioner will\nbe deposited by the issuing institution directly into the standby trust fund in\naccordance with instructions from the commissioner. This standby trust fund\nmust meet the requirements of the trust fund specified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, except that: (a) an originally\nsigned duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the commissioner\nwith the letter of credit; and\n(b) unless the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this\nsubdivision, the following are not required by these regulations: (1)\npayments into the trust fund as specified\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (2)\nupdating of Schedule A of the trust\nagreement (see section\n373-2.8\n[j][1]\nof\nthis Part) to show current closure cost estimates; (3)\nannual valuations as required by the\ntrust agreement; and\n(4)\nnotices of\nnonpayment as required by the trust agreement. (iv)\n\nThe letter of credit must be accompanied\nby a letter from the owner or operator referring to the letter of credit by\nnumber, issuing institution, and date, and providing the following information: the EPA identification number, name and address of the facility, and the amount\nof funds assured for closure of the facility by the letter of credit. (v) The letter of credit must be irrevocable\nand issued for a period of at least one year. The letter of credit must provide\nthat the expiration date will be automatically extended for a period of at\nleast one year unless, at least 120 days before the current expiration date, the issuing institution notifies both the owner or operator and the\ncommissioner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a decision not to\nextend the expiration date. Under the terms of the letter of credit, the 120\ndays will begin on the date when both the owner or operator and the\ncommissioner have received the notice, as evidenced by the return\nreceipts. (vi)\n\nThe letter of credit\nmust be issued in an amount at least equal to the current closure cost\nestimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (vii)\n\nWhenever the current closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the amount of the credit, the\nowner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the\namount of the credit to be increased so that it at least equals the current\nclosure cost estimate, and submit evidence of such increase to the\ncommissioner, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the current closure cost estimate\ndecreases, the amount of the credit may be reduced to the amount of the current\nclosure cost estimate following written approval by the commissioner. (viii)\n\nFollowing a determination, pursuant to\nsection\n373-3.7\nof this Subpart, that the\nowner or operator has failed to perform final closure in accordance with the\nclosure plan and other interim status requirements when required to do so, the\ncommissioner may draw on the letter of credit. (ix)\n\nIf the owner or operator does not\nestablish alternate financial assurance, as specified in this subdivision, and\nobtain written approval of such alternate assurance from the commissioner\nwithin 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the commissioner\nof a notice from the issuing institution that it has decided not to extend the\nletter of credit beyond the current expiration date, the commissioner will draw\non the letter of credit. The commissioner may delay the drawing if the issuing\ninstitution grants an extension of the term of the credit. During the last 30\ndays of any such extension, the commissioner will draw on the letter of credit\nif the owner or operator has failed to provide alternate financial assurance as\nspecified in this subdivision and obtain written approval of such assurance\nfrom the commissioner. (x) The\ncommissioner will return the letter of credit to the issuing institution for\ntermination when: (a) an owner or operator\nsubstitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases\nthe owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with\nparagraph (8) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nClosure insurance. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by obtaining closure insurance which conforms\nto the requirements of this paragraph and submitting a certificate of such\ninsurance to the department. The owner or operator must submit to the\ndepartment a letter from an insurer stating that the insurer is considering\nissuance of closure insurance conforming to the requirements of this paragraph\nto the owner or operator. Within 90 days after the effective date of these\nregulations, the owner or operator must submit the certificate of insurance to\nthe department or establish other financial assurance as specified in this\nsection. At a minimum, the insurer must be authorized by the Superintendent of\nthe New York State Department of Financial Services to conduct the business of\ninsurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus lines\ninsurer, in New York State. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the wording\nspecified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(4)\nof\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nThe closure\ninsurance policy must be issued for a limit of liability at least equal to the\ncurrent closure cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision. The term\nlimits of liability\nmeans the total\namount the insurer is obligated to pay under the policy. Actual payments by the\ninsurer will not change the limits of liability, although the insurer's future\nliability will be lowered by the amount of the payments. (iv)\n\nThe closure insurance policy must\nguarantee that funds will be available to close the facility whenever final\nclosure occurs. The policy must also guarantee that once final closure begins, the insurer will be responsible for paying out funds, up to an amount equal to\nthe limits of liability of the policy, upon the direction of the commissioner, to such party or parties as the commissioner specifies. (v) After beginning partial or final closure, an owner or operator or any other person authorized to conduct closure may\nrequest reimbursements for closure expenditures by submitting itemized bills to\nthe commissioner. The owner or operator may request reimbursements for partial\nclosure only if the remaining value of the policy is sufficient to cover the\nmaximum costs of closing the facility over its remaining operating life. Within\n60 days after receiving bills for closure activities, the commissioner will\ninstruct the insurer to make reimbursements in such amounts as the commissioner\nspecifies in writing, if the commissioner determines that the partial or final\nclosure expenditures are in accordance with the approved closure plan or\notherwise justified. If the commissioner has reason to believe that the maximum\ncost of closure over the remaining life of the facility will be significantly\ngreater than the face amount of the policy, the commissioner may withhold\nreimbursements of such amounts as he or she deems prudent until the\ncommissioner determines, in accordance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision, that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial\nassurance for final closure of the particular facility. If the commissioner\ndoes not instruct the insurer to make such reimbursements, the commissioner\nwill provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of\nreasons. (vi)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust maintain the policy in full force and effect until the commissioner\nconsents to termination of the policy by the owner or operator as specified in\nsubparagraph (x) of this paragraph. Failure to pay the premium, without\nsubstitution of alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision, will constitute a significant violation of these regulations, warranting such\nremedy as the commissioner deems necessary. Such violation will be deemed to\nbegin upon receipt by the commissioner of a notice of future cancellation, termination or failure to renew due to nonpayment of the premium, rather than\nupon the date of expiration. (vii)\n\nEach policy must contain a provision allowing assignment of the policy to a\nsuccessor owner or operator. Such assignment may be conditional upon consent of\nthe insurer, provided such consent is not unreasonably refused. (viii)\n\nThe policy must provide that the\ninsurer may not cancel, terminate or fail to renew the policy except for\nfailure to pay the premium. The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a\nminimum, provide the insured with the option of renewal at the limits of\nliability of the expiring policy. If there is a failure to pay the premium, the\ninsurer may elect to cancel, terminate or fail to renew the policy by sending\nnotice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator\nand the commissioner. Cancellation, termination or failure to renew may not\noccur, however, during the 120 days beginning with the date of receipt of the\nnotice by both the commissioner and the owner or operator, as evidenced by the\nreturn receipts. Cancellation, termination or failure to renew may not occur\nand the policy will remain in full force and effect, in the event that on or\nbefore the date of expiration: (a) the\ncommissioner deems the facility abandoned; or\n(b) interim status is terminated or revoked; or\n(c) closure is ordered by the\ncommissioner or a United States district court or other court of competent\njurisdiction; or\n(d) the owner or\noperator is named as debtor in a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under\n11\nUSC\nA (Bankruptcy); or\n(e) the\npremium due is paid. (ix)\n\nWhenever the current closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the limits of liability of the\npolicy, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either\ncause the limits of liability face amount to be increased to an amount at least\nequal to the current closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase\nto the commissioner, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the current closure cost estimate\ndecreases, the limits of liability may be reduced to the amount of the current\nclosure cost estimate following written approval by the commissioner. (x) The commissioner will give written\nconsent to the owner or operator that the insurance policy may be terminated\nwhen: (a) an owner or operator substitutes\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases the owner or\noperator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (8)\nof this subdivision. (5)\n\nFinancial test and guarantee for closure. (i) An owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility may satisfy the requirements of this section\nby demonstrating that the owner or operator passes a financial test as\nspecified in this paragraph. No revenue-oriented facilities will be allowed to\nuse this financial assurance mechanism. To pass this test, the owner or\noperator must meet the criteria of either clause (\na\n) or\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph. (a) The owner or operator must have: (1)\ntwo of the following three ratios: a\nratio of total liabilities to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of\nnet income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization to total liabilities\ngreater than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater\nthan 1.5; (2)\nnet working capital\nand tangible net worth each at least six times the sum of the current closure\nand post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost\nestimates; (3)\ntangible net worth\nof at least $10 million; and\n(4)\nassets in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of the total\nassets or at least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure\ncost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost\nestimates. (b) The owner\nor operator must have: (1)\na current rating\nfor their most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A or BBB as issued by Standard\nand Poor's, or Aaa, Aa, A or Baa as issued by Moody's; (2)\ntangible net worth at least six times the\nsum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current\nplugging and abandonment costs; (3)\ntangible net worth of at least $10 million; and\n(4)\nassets located in the United States\namounting to at least 90 percent of the total assets or at least six times the\nsum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current\nplugging and abandonment costs. (ii)\n\nThe phrases \"current closure and\npost-closure cost estimates\" and \"current plugging and abandonment cost\nestimates,\" as used in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, refer to the cost\nestimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-3 of the letter from the owner's\nor operator's chief financial officer. (iii)\n\nTo demonstrate that he or she meets\nthis test, the owner or operator must submit the following items to the\ncommissioner: (a) a letter signed by the\nowner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in\nsection\n373-2.8\n(j)(5)\nof\nthis Part; (b) a copy of the\nindependent certified public accountant's report on examination of the owner's\nor operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and\n(c) a special report from the\nowner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or\noperator stating that: (1)\nthe accountant has\ncompared the data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies\nas having been derived from the independently audited, year-end financial\nstatements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial\nstatements; and\n(2)\nin connection\nwith that procedure, no matters came to the accountant's attention which caused\nthe accountant to believe that the specified data should be adjusted. (iv)\n\nAfter the initial\nsubmission of items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, the\nowner or operator must send updated information to the commissioner within 90\ndays after the close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must\nconsist of all three items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. (v) If the owner or\noperator no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, the owner or operator must send notice to the commissioner of intent\nto establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision. The notice must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 90\ndays after the end of the fiscal year for which the year-end financial data\nshow that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements. The owner or\noperator must provide the alternate financial assurance within 120 days after\nthe end of such fiscal year. (vi)\n\nThe commissioner may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator\nmay no longer meet the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, require reports of financial condition at any time from the owner or operator\nin addition to those specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. If the\ncommissioner finds, on the basis of such report or other information, that the\nowner or operator no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as\nspecified in this subdivision within 30 days after notification of such a\nfinding. (vii)\n\nThe commissioner may\ndisallow use of this test on the basis of qualifications in the opinion\nexpressed by the independent certified public accountant in his or her report\non examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements (see clause\n[iii][\nb\n] of this paragraph). An adverse opinion or a\ndisclaimer of opinion will be cause for disallowance. The commissioner will\nevaluate other qualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator\nmust provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision\nwithin 30 days after notification of the disallowance. (viii)\n\nThe owner or operator is no longer\nrequired to submit the items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph\nwhen: (a) an owner or operator substitutes\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases the owner or\noperator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (8)\nof this subdivision. (ix)\n\nAn owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility may meet the requirements of this\nsubdivision by obtaining a written guarantee, hereinafter referred to as\n\"guarantee.\" If the firm which is providing the guarantee does not meet the\ndefinition of \"revenue-oriented\" in section\n373-2.8\nor\n373-3.8\nof this Part, it may\nprovide the guarantee on behalf of the owner or operator even if the owner or\noperator is a \"revenue-oriented\" facility. For a revenue-oriented facility, the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator cannot be consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. The guarantor must be the direct or\nhigher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent\ncorporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm\nwith a \"substantial business relationship\" with the owner or operator. The\nguarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in subparagraphs\n(i) through (vii) of this paragraph and must comply with the terms of the\nguarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording\nspecified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(6)\nof\nthis Part. A certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the items sent to\nthe commissioner as specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. One of\nthese items must be the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If\nthe guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner\nor operator, the letter must describe the value received in consideration of\nthe guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a \"substantial business\nrelationship\" with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this\n\"substantial business relationship\" and the value received in consideration of\nthe guarantee. The terms of the guarantee must provide that: (a) If the owner or operator fails to perform\nfinal closure of a facility covered by the guarantee in accordance with the\nclosure plan and other interim status requirements whenever required to do so, the guarantor will do so or make payment as the commissioner shall direct, in\nwriting. (b) The guarantee will\nremain in force unless the guarantor sends notice of cancellation, by certified\nmail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator and to the\ncommissioner. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days\nbeginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the\nowner or operator and the commissioner, as evidenced by the return\nreceipts. (c) If the owner or\noperator fails to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision and obtain the written approval of such alternate assurance from\nthe commissioner, within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator\nand the commissioner of a notice of cancellation of the guarantee from the\nguarantor, the guarantor will provide such alternate financial assurance in the\nname of the owner or operator. (6)\n\nUse of multiple financial mechanisms. An\nowner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this subdivision by\nestablishing more than one financial mechanism per facility. These mechanisms\nare limited to trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit, and insurance. The\nmechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (1) through (4), respectively, of\nthis subdivision, except that it is the combination of mechanisms, rather than\nthe single mechanisms, which must provide financial assurance for an amount at\nleast equal to the current closure cost estimate. If an owner or operator uses\na trust fund in combination with a surety bond or a letter of credit, the trust\nfund may be used as the standby trust fund for the other two mechanisms. A\nsingle standby trust fund, if required, may be established for two or more\nmechanisms. The commissioner may use any or all of the mechanisms to provide\nfor closure of the facility. (7)\n\nUse of a financial mechanism for multiple facilities. An owner or operator may\nuse a financial assurance mechanism specified in this subdivision to meet the\nrequirements of this subdivision for more than one facility. Evidence of\nfinancial assurance submitted to the commissioner must include a list showing, for each facility, the EPA identification number, name, address, and the amount\nof funds for closure assured by the mechanism. The amount of funds available\nthrough the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be\navailable if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for each\nfacility. In directing funds available through the mechanism for closure of any\nof the facilities covered by the mechanism, the commissioner may direct only\nthe amount of funds designated for that facility, unless the owner or operator\nagrees to the use of additional funds available under the mechanism. (8)\n\nRelease of the owner or operator from the\nrequirements of this subdivision. Within 60 days after receiving certifications\nfrom the owner or operator and an independent professional engineer registered\nin New York that final closure has been completed in accordance with the\napproved closure plan, the commissioner will notify the owner or operator, in\nwriting, that the owner or operator is no longer required by this subdivision\nto maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility, unless the\ncommissioner has reason to believe that final closure has not been in\naccordance with the approved closure plan. The commissioner shall provide the\nowner or operator a detailed written statement of the reason to believe that\nclosure has not been in accordance with the approved closure\nplan. (e) Cost\nestimate for post-closure care. (1)\n\nThe\nowner or operator of a hazardous waste disposal unit must have a detailed\nwritten estimate, in current dollars, of the annual cost of post- closure\nmonitoring and maintenance of the facility in accordance with the applicable\npost- closure regulations in subdivisions (g) through (j) of this section and\nsections\n373-3.11\n(e), 373-3.12\n(g), 373-3.13\n(g) and\n373-3.14\n(d) of\nthis Subpart. (i) The post-closure cost\nestimate must be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a third\nparty to conduct post-closure care activities. A\nthird party\nis a party who is neither a parent nor a subsidiary of the owner or operator. (See definition of parent corporation in subdivision [b] of this\nsection.)\n(ii)\n\nThe post-closure\ncost estimate is calculated by multiplying the annual post-closure cost\nestimate by the number of years of post-closure care required under section\n373-2.7\n(g) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nDuring the\nactive life of the facility, the owner or operator must adjust the post-closure\ncost estimate for inflation within 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the\nestablishment of the financial instruments used to comply with subdivision (f)\nof this section. For owners and operators using the financial test or\nguarantee, the post-closure care cost estimate must be updated for inflation\nwithin 30 days after the close of the firm's fiscal year and before submission\nof updated information to the commissioner as specified in section\n373-3.8\n(f)(5)(v)\nof this Subpart. The adjustment may be made by recalculating the post-closure\ncost estimate in current dollars, or by using an inflation factor derived from\nthe most recent\n\nImplicit Price Deflator for Gross National\n\nProduct\npublished by the U.S. Department of Commerce in its\n\nSurvey of Current Business, as specified in subparagraphs (i)\nand (ii) of this paragraph. The inflation factor is the result of dividing the\nlatest published annual deflator by the deflator for the previous year. (i) The first adjustment is made by\nmultiplying the post-closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result\nis the adjusted closure cost estimate. (ii)\n\nSubsequent adjustments are made by\nmultiplying the latest adjusted post-closure cost estimate by the latest\ninflation factor. (3)\n\nDuring the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must revise the\npost-closure cost estimate no later than 30 days after a revision to the\npost-closure plan which increases the cost of post-closure care. If the owner\nor operator has an approved post-closure plan, the post- closure cost estimate\nmust be revised no later than 30 days after the commissioner has approved the\nrequest to modify the plan, if the change in the post-closure plan increases\nthe cost of post- closure care. The revised post-closure cost estimate must be\nadjusted for inflation as specified in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (4)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must keep the following at the facility during the operating life of\nthe facility: the latest post-closure cost estimate prepared in accordance with\nparagraphs (1) and (3) of this subdivision and, when this estimate has been\nadjusted in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the latest\nadjusted post-closure cost estimate. (f) Financial assurance for\npost-closure care. An owner or operator of a facility with a hazardous waste\ndisposal unit must establish financial assurance for post-closure care of the\ndisposal units. (1)\n\nPost-closure trust\nfund. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy\nthe requirements of this subdivision by establishing a post-closure trust fund\nwhich conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an\noriginally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the commissioner. The\ntrustee must be an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose\ntrust operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State\nagency. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the\ntrust agreement must be identical to the wording specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(1)\nof\nthis Part, and the trust agreement must be accompanied by a formal\ncertification of acknowledgment (for example, see section\n373-2.8\n[j][1]\n). Schedule A of the trust agreement must be updated within 60 days after a change\nin the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate covered by the\nagreement. (iii)\n\nPayments into the\ntrust fund must be made annually by the owner or operator over the first five\nyears of operation or over the remaining operating life of the facility as\nestimated in the closure plan, whichever period is shorter; this period is\nhereinafter referred to as the \"pay-in period.\" The payments into the\npost-closure trust fund must be made as follows: (a) For a new or revenue-oriented facility, the first payment must be equal to the total post-closure cost estimate, or an\nalternative mechanism must be provided, which when combined with the trust\nfund, provides financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the current\npost-closure cost estimate. For a revenue oriented facility the first payment\nis due 90 days after the date these regulations are promulgated. For all other\nfacilities, the first payment must be at least equal to the current\npost-closure cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision, divided by the number of years in the pay-in period. (b) Subsequent payments must be made no later\nthan 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The amount of\neach subsequent payment must be determined by this formula: Next payment =CE-CV/Y\nwhere CE is the current post-closure cost estimate, CV is\nthe current value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in\nthe pay-in period. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator may accelerate\npayments into the trust fund or may deposit the full amount of the current\npost-closure cost estimate at the time the fund is established. However, the\nowner or operator must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value\nthat the fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (v) If the owner or operator establishes a\npost-closure trust fund after having used one or more alternate mechanisms\nspecified in this subdivision, the first payment must be in at least the amount\nthat the fund would contain if the trust fund were established initially and\nannual payments made as specified in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. (vi)\n\nAfter the pay-in\nperiod is completed, whenever the current post-closure cost estimate changes\nduring the operating life of the facility, the owner or operator must compare\nthe new estimate with the trustee's most recent annual valuation of the trust\nfund. If the value of the fund is less than the amount of the new estimate, the\nowner or operator, within 60 days after the change in the cost estimate, must\neither deposit an amount into the fund so that its value after this deposit at\nleast equals the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate, or obtain\nother financial assurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the\ndifference. (vii)\n\nDuring the\noperating life of the facility, if the value of the trust fund is greater than\nthe total amount of the current post-closure cost estimate, the owner or\noperator may submit a written request to the commissioner for release of the\namount in excess of the current post-closure cost estimate. (viii)\n\nIf an owner or operator substitutes\nother financial assurance as specified in this subdivision for all or part of\nthe trust fund, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the\ncommissioner for release of the amount in excess of the current post-closure\ncost estimate covered by the trust fund. (ix)\n\nWithin 60 days after receiving a request\nfrom the owner or operator for release of funds as specified in subparagraph\n(vii) or (viii) of this paragraph, the commissioner will instruct the trustee\nto release to the owner or operator such funds as the commissioner specifies in\nwriting. (x) During the period of\npost-closure care, the commissioner may approve a release of funds if the owner\nor operator demonstrates to the commissioner that the value of the trust fund\nexceeds the remaining cost of post-closure care. (xi)\n\nAn owner or operator or any other person\nauthorized to conduct post-closure care may request reimbursements for\npost-closure expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the commissioner. Within 60 days after receiving bills for post-closure care activities, the\ncommissioner will instruct the trustee to make reimbursements in those amounts\nas the commissioner specifies in writing, if the commissioner determines that\nthe post-closure expenditures are in accordance with the approved post-closure\nplan, or otherwise justified. If the commissioner does not instruct the trustee\nto make such reimbursements, the commissioner will provide the owner or\noperator with a detailed written statement of reasons. (xii)\n\nThe commissioner will agree to\ntermination of the trust when: (a) an owner\nor operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision; or\n(b) the\ncommissioner releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this\nsubdivision in accordance with this paragraph. (2)\n\nSurety bond. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by obtaining a surety bond which conforms to\nthe requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the commissioner. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed\nas acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department\nof the Treasury. (ii)\n\nThe wording\nof the surety bond must be identical to the wording specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(2)\nof\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nThe owner or\noperator who uses a surety bond to satisfy the requirements of this subdivision\nmust also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the bond, all\npayments made thereunder will be deposited by the surety into the standby trust\nfund in accordance with instructions from the commissioner. This standby trust\nfund must meet the requirements specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except that: (a) an originally signed\nduplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the commissioner with the\nsurety bond; and\n(b) until the\nstandby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this subdivision, the following are not required by these regulations: (1)\npayments into the trust fund as specified\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (2)\nupdating of Schedule A of the trust\nagreement (see section\n373-2.8\n[j][1]\nof\nthis Part) to show current post-closure cost estimates; (3)\nannual valuations as required by the\ntrust agreement; and\n(4)\nnotices of\nnonpayment as required by the trust agreement. (iv)\n\nThe bond must guarantee that the owner\nor operator will: (a) fund the standby trust\nfund in an amount equal to the penal sum of the bond before the beginning of\nfinal closure of the facility; (b) fund the standby trust fund in an amount equal to the penal sum within 15 days\nafter an order to begin final closure is issued by the commissioner or a United\n\nStates district court or other court of competent jurisdiction; or\n(c) provide alternate financial assurance as\nspecified in this subdivision, and obtain the commissioner's written approval\nof the assurance provided, within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or\noperator and the commissioner of a notice of cancellation of the bond from the\nsurety. (v) Under the\nterms of the bond, the surety will become liable on the bond obligation when\nthe owner or operator fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond. (vi)\n\nThe penal sum of the bond must be in an\namount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate, except as\nprovided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (vii)\n\nWhenever the current post-closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the penal sum, the owner or\noperator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the penal sum to\nbe increased to an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost\nestimate and submit evidence of such increase to the commissioner, or obtain\nother financial assurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the\nincrease. Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate decreases, the penal\nsum may be reduced to the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate, following written approval by the commissioner. (viii)\n\nUnder the terms of the bond, the\nsurety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation, by certified\nmail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator and to the\ncommissioner. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days\nbeginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the\nowner or operator and the commissioner, as evidenced by the return\nreceipts. (ix)\n\nThe owner or\noperator may cancel the bond if the commissioner has given prior written\nconsent based on the receipt of evidence of alternate financial assurance as\nspecified in this subdivision. (3)\n\nPost-closure letter of credit. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by obtaining an irrevocable standby letter of\ncredit which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the\nletter to the commissioner. The issuing institution must be an entity which has\nthe authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter of credit operations\nare regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the letter of credit must\nbe identical to the wording specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(3)\nof\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nAn owner or\noperator who uses a letter of credit to satisfy the requirements of this\nsubdivision must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the\nletter of credit, all amounts paid pursuant to a draft by the commissioner will\nbe deposited by the issuing institution directly into the standby trust fund in\naccordance with instructions from the commissioner. This standby trust fund\nmust meet the requirements of the trust fund specified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, except that: (a) an originally\nsigned duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the commissioner\nwith the letter of credit; and\n(b) unless the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this\nsubdivision, the following are not required by these regulations: (1)\npayments into the trust fund as specified\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (2)\nupdating of Schedule A of the trust\nagreement (see section\n373-2.8\n[j][1]\nof\nthis Part), to show current post-closure cost estimates; (3)\nannual valuations as required by the\ntrust agreement; and\n(4)\nnotices of\nnonpayment as required by the trust agreement. (iv)\n\nThe letter of credit must be accompanied\nby a letter from the owner or operator referring to the letter of credit by\nnumber, issuing institution and date, and providing the following information: the EPA identification number, name and address of the facility, and the amount\nof funds assured for post-closure care of the facility by letter of\ncredit. (v) The letter of credit\nmust be irrevocable and issued for a period of at least one year. The letter of\ncredit must provide that the expiration date will be automatically extended for\na period of at least one year unless, at least 120 days before the current\nexpiration date, the issuing institution notifies both the owner or operator\nand the commissioner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a\ndecision not to extend the expiration date. Under the terms of the letter of\ncredit, the 120 days will begin on the date when both the owner or operator and\nthe commissioner have received the notice, as evidenced by the return\nreceipts. (vi)\n\nThe letter of credit\nmust be issued in an amount at least equal to the current post- closure cost\nestimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (vii)\n\nWhenever the current post-closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the amount of the credit during\nthe operating life of the facility, the owner or operator, within 60 days after\nthe increase, must either cause the amount of the credit to be increased so\nthat it at least equals the current post-closure cost estimate and submit\nevidence of such increase to the commissioner, or obtain other financial\nassurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the\ncurrent post-closure cost estimate decreases during the operating life of the\nfacility, the amount of the credit may be reduced to the amount of the current\npost-closure cost estimate following written approval by the\ncommissioner. (viii)\n\nDuring the\nperiod of post-closure care, the commissioner may approve a decrease in the\namount of the letter of credit if the owner or operator demonstrates to the\ncommissioner that the amount exceeds the remaining cost of post-closure\ncare. (ix)\n\nFollowing a\ndetermination, pursuant to section\n373-3.7\nof this Subpart, that the\nowner or operator has failed to perform post-closure care in accordance with\nthe post-closure plan and other permit requirements, the commissioner may draw\non the letter of credit. (x) If the\nowner or operator does not establish alternate financial assurance as specified\nin this subdivision and obtain written approval of such alternate assurance\nfrom the commissioner within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or\noperator and the commissioner of a notice from the issuing institution that it\nhas decided not to extend the letter of credit beyond the current expiration\ndate, the commissioner will draw on the letter of credit. The commissioner may\ndelay the drawings if the issuing institution grants an extension of the term\nof the credit. During the last 30 days of any such extension, the commissioner\nwill draw on the letter of credit if the owner or operator has failed to\nprovide alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision and\nobtain written approval of such assurance from the commissioner. (xi)\n\nThe commissioner will return the letter\nof credit to the issuing institution for termination when: (a) an owner or operator substitutes\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases the owner or\noperator from the requirements of this subdivision in accordance with paragraph\n(8). (4)\n\nPost-closure insurance. (i) An owner or\noperator may satisfy the requirements of this subdivision by obtaining\npost-closure insurance which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and\nsubmitting a certificate of such insurance to the commissioner. At a minimum, the insurer must be authorized by the superintendent of the New York State\n\nInsurance Department to conduct the business of insurance, or eligible to\nprovide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer, in New York\n\nState. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the\ncertificate of insurance must be identical to the wording specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(4)\nof\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nThe post-closure\ninsurance policy must be issued for a limit of liability at least equal to the\ncurrent post-closure cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of\nthis section. The term\nlimits of liability\nmeans the total\namount the insurer is obligated to pay under the policy. Actual payments by the\ninsurer will not change the limits of liability, although the insurer's future\nliability will be lowered by the amount of the payments. (iv)\n\nThe post-closure insurance policy must\nguarantee that funds will be available to provide post-closure care of the\nfacility whenever the post-closure period begins. The policy must also\nguarantee that once post-closure care begins, the insurer will be responsible\nfor paying out funds, up to an amount equal to the limits of liability of the\npolicy, upon the direction of the commissioner, to such party or parties as the\ncommissioner specifies. (v) An\nowner or operator or any other person authorized to perform post-closure care\nmay request reimbursements for post-closure expenditures by submitting itemized\nbills to the commissioner. Within 60 days after receiving bills for\npost-closure care activities, the commissioner will instruct the insurer to\nmake reimbursements in those amounts as the commissioner specifies in writing, if the commissioner determines that the post-closure expenditures are in\naccordance with the approved post-closure plan, or otherwise justified. If the\ncommissioner does not instruct the insurer to make such reimbursements, the\ncommissioner will provide the owner or operator with a detailed written\nstatement of reasons. (vi)\n(a) The owner or operator must maintain the\npolicy in full force and effect until the commissioner consents to termination\nof the policy by the owner or operator as specified in subparagraph (xi) of\nthis paragraph. (b) Failure to pay\nthe premium, without substitution of alternate financial assurance as specified\nin this subdivision, will constitute a significant violation of these\nregulations, warranting such remedy as the commissioner deems necessary. Such\nviolation will be deemed to begin upon receipt by the commissioner of a notice\nof future cancellation, termination or failure to renew due to nonpayment of\nthe premium, rather than upon the date of expiration. (vii)\n\nEach policy must contain a provision\nallowing assignment of the policy to a successor owner or operator. Such\nassignment may be conditional upon consent of the insurer, provided such\nconsent is not unreasonably refused. (viii)\n\nThe policy must provide that the\ninsurer may not cancel, terminate or fail to renew the policy except for\nfailure to pay the premium. The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a\nminimum, provide the insured with the option of renewal at the limits of\nliability of the expiring policy. If there is a failure to pay the premium, the\ninsurer may elect to cancel, terminate or fail to renew the policy by sending\nnotice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator\nand the commissioner. Cancellation, termination or failure to renew may not\noccur, however, during the 120 days beginning with the date of receipt of the\nnotice by both the commissioner and the owner or operator, as evidenced by the\nreturn receipts. Cancellation, termination or failure to renew may not occur, and the policy will remain in full force and effect, in the event that on or\nbefore the date of expiration: (a) the\ncommissioner deems the facility abandoned; (b) interim status is terminated or\nrevoked; (c) closure is ordered by\nthe commissioner or a United States district court or other court of competent\njurisdiction; (d) the owner or\noperator is named as debtor in a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under\n11\nUSC\nA (Bankruptcy); or\n(e) the\npremium due is paid. (ix)\n\nWhenever the current post-closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the limits of liability of the\npolicy during the operating life of the facility, the owner or operator, within\n60 days after the increase, must either cause the limits of liability to be\nincreased to an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate\nand submit evidence of such increase to the commissioner, or obtain other\nfinancial assurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate decreases during the operating\nlife of the facility, the limits of liability may be reduced to the amount of\nthe current post-closure cost estimate following written approval by the\ncommissioner. (x) Commencing on the\ndate that liability to make payments pursuant to the policy accrues, the\ninsurer will thereafter annually increase the limits of liability of the\npolicy. Such increase must be equivalent to the limits of liability of the\npolicy, less any payments made, multiplied by an amount equivalent to 85\npercent of the most recent investment rate or of the equivalent coupon-issue\nyield announced by the United States Treasury for 26-week Treasury\nsecurities. (xi)\n\nThe commissioner\nwill give written consent to the owner or operator that the insurance policy\nmay be terminated when: (a) an owner or\noperator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision; or\n(b) the\ncommissioner releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this\nsubdivision in accordance with paragraph (8). (5)\n\nFinancial test and guarantee for\npost-closure care. (i) An owner or operator\nof a facility which is not a revenue-oriented facility may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by demonstrating that the owner or operator\npasses a financial test as specified in this paragraph. No revenue-oriented\nfacilities will be allowed to use this financial assurance mechanism. To pass\nthis test, the owner or operator must meet the criteria of either clause\n(\na\n) or (\nb\n) of this subparagraph: (a) The owner or operator must have: (1)\ntwo of the following three ratios: a\nratio of total liabilities to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of\nnet income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization to total liabilities\ngreater than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater\nthan 1.5; (2)\nnet working capital\nand tangible net worth each at least six times the sum of the current closure\nand post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost\nestimates; (3)\ntangible net worth\nof at least $10 million; and\n(4)\nassets in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of total assets or\nat least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost\nestimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost estimates. (b) The owner or operator must\nhave: (1)\na current rating for their most\nrecent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's, or\n\nAaa, Aa, A or Baa as issued by Moody's; (2)\ntangible net worth at least six times the\nsum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current\nplugging and abandonment cost estimates; (3)\ntangible net worth of at least $10\nmillion; and\n(4)\nassets in the\n\nUnited States amounting to at least 90 percent of the total assets or at least\nsix times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and\nthe current plugging and abandonment cost estimates. (ii)\n\nThe phrases \"current closure\nand post-closure cost estimates\" and \"current plugging and abandonment cost\nestimates,\" as used in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, refer to the cost\nestimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-3 of the letter from the owner's\nor operator's chief financial officer. (iii)\n\nTo demonstrate that he or she meets\nthis test, the owner or operator must submit the following items to the\ncommissioner: (a) a letter signed by the\nowner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in\nsection\n373-2.8\n(j)(5)\nof\nthis Part; (b) a copy of the\nindependent certified public accountant's report on examination of the owner's\nor operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and\n(c) a special report from the\nowner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or\noperator, stating that: (1)\nthe accountant has\ncompared the data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies\nas having been derived from the independently audited, year-end financial\nstatements for the latest fiscal year; and\n(2)\nin connection with that procedure, no\nmatters came to the acountant's attention which caused the accountant to\nbelieve that the specified data should be adjusted. (iv)\n\nAfter the initial submission\nof items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, the owner or\noperator must send updated information to the commissioner within 90 days after\nthe close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must consist of all\nthree items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (v) If the owner or operator no longer meets\nthe requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the owner or operator\nmust send notice to the commissioner of intent to establish alternate financial\nassurance as specified in this subdivision. The notice must be sent by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested, within 90 days after the end of the\nfiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or\noperator no longer meets the requirements. The owner or operator must provide\nthe alternate financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal\nyear. (vi)\n\nThe commissioner may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the\nrequirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, require reports of\nfinancial condition at any time from the owner or operator in addition to those\nspecified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. If the commissioner finds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the owner or operator\nno longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the\nowner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in\nthis subdivision within 30 days after notification of such a finding. (vii)\n\nThe commissioner may disallow use of\nthis test on the basis of qualifications in the opinion expressed by the\nindependent certified public accountant in his or her report on examination of\nthe owner's or operator's financial statements (see clause [iii][\nb\n] of this paragraph). An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of\nopinion will be cause for disallowance. The commissioner will evaluate other\nqualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator must provide\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision within 30 days\nafter notification of the disallowance. (viii)\n\nDuring the period of post-closure\ncare, the commissioner may approve a decrease in the current post-closure cost\nestimate for which this test demonstrates financial assurance if the owner or\noperator demonstrates to the commissioner that the amount of the cost estimate\nexceeds the remaining cost of post-closure care. (ix)\n\nThe owner or operator is no longer\nrequired to submit the items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph\nwhen: (a) an owner or operator substitutes\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases the owner or\noperator from the requirements of this subdivision in accordance with paragraph\n(8) of this subdivision. (x) An owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility may meet the requirements of this\nsubdivision by obtaining a written guarantee, hereinafter referred to as\n\"guarantee.\" If the firm which is providing the guarantee does not meet the\ndefinition of revenue-oriented in section\n373-2.8\nor\n373-3.8\nof this Part, it may\nprovide the guarantee on behalf of the owner or operator even if the owner or\noperator is a revenue-oriented facility. For a revenue-oriented facility, the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator cannot be consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. The guarantor must be the director or\nhigher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent\ncorporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm\nwith a substantial business relationship with the owner or operator. The\nguarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in subparagraphs\n(i) through (viii) of this paragraph and must comply with the terms of the\nguarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording\nspecified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(6)\nof\nthis Part. A certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the items sent to\nthe commissioner as specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. One of\nthese items must be the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If\nthe guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner\nor operator, the letter must describe the value received in consideration of\nthe guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a \"substantial business\nrelationship\" with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this\n\"substantial business relationship\" and the value received in consideration of\nthe guarantee. The terms of the guarantee must provide that: (a) If the owner or operator fails to perform\npost-closure care of a facility covered by the guarantee in accordance with the\npost-closure plan and other interim status permit requirements whenever\nrequired to do so, the guarantor will do so, or make payment as the\ncommissioner shall direct, in writing. (b) The guarantee will remain in force unless\nthe guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail, return receipt\nrequested, to the owner or operator and to the commissioner. Cancellation may\nnot occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the\nnotice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the commissioner, as\nevidenced by the return receipts. (c) If the owner or operator fails to provide\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision and obtain the\nwritten approval of such alternate assurance from the commissioner within 90\ndays after receipt by both the owner or operator and the commissioner of a\nnotice of cancellation of the guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will\nprovide such alternate financial assurance in the name of the owner or\noperator. (6)\n\nUse of multiple financial mechanisms. An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this\nsubdivision by establishing more than one financial mechanism per facility. These mechanisms are limited to trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit, and insurance. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (1), (2), (3)\nand (4), respectively, of this subdivision, except that it is the combination\nof mechanisms, rather than the single mechanism, which must provide financial\nassurance for an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost\nestimate. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in combination with a\nsurety bond or a letter of credit, the trust fund may be used as the standby\ntrust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust fund, if required, may be established for two or more mechanisms. The commissioner may use any or\nall of the mechanisms to provide for post-closure care of the\nfacility. (7)\n\nUse of a\nfinancial mechanism for multiple facilities. An owner or operator may use a financial assurance\nmechanism specified in this subdivision to meet the requirements of this\nsubdivision for more than one facility. Evidence of financial assurance\nsubmitted to the commissioner must include a list showing, for each facility, the EPA identification number, name, address, and the amount of funds for\npost-closure care assured by the mechanism. The amount of funds available\nthrough the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be\navailable if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for each\nfacility. In directing funds available through the mechanism for post-closure\ncare of any of the facilities covered by the mechanism, the commissioner may\ndirect only the amount of funds designated for that facility, unless the owner\nor operator agrees to the use of additional funds available under the\nmechanism. (8)\n\nRelease of\nthe owner or operator from the requirements of this subdivision. Within 60 days\nafter receiving certifications from the owner or operator and an independent\nregistered professional engineer that the post-closure care period has been\ncompleted in accordance with the approved post-closure plan, the commissioner\nwill notify the owner or operator in writing that the owner or operator is no\nlonger required by this subdivision to maintain financial assurance for\npost-closure care of that unit, unless the commissioner has reason to believe\nthat post-closure care has not been in accordance with the approved\npost-closure plan. The commissioner will provide the owner or operator with a\ndetailed written statement of any reason to believe that post-closure care has\nnot been in accordance with the approved post-closure plan. Note: The notice releases the owner or operator only from the\nrequirements for financial assurance for post-closure care of the facility; it\ndoes not release the owner or operator from legal responsibility for meeting\nthe post-closure standards. (g) Use of a mechanism for financial\nassurance of both closure and post-closure care. An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements for\nfinancial assurance for both closure and post- closure care for one or more\nfacilities by using a trust fund, surety bond, letter of credit, insurance, financial test or guarantee that meets the specifications for the mechanism in\nboth subdivisions (d) and (f) of this section. The amount of funds available\nthrough the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be\navailable if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for\nfinancial assurance of closure and post-closure care. (h) Liability requirements. (1)\n\nCoverage for sudden accidental\noccurrences. An owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage or\ndisposal facility, or a group of such facilities, must demonstrate financial\nresponsibility for bodily injury and property damage to third parties caused by\nsudden accidental occurrences arising from operations of the facility or group\nof facilities. The owner or operator must have and maintain liability coverage\nfor sudden accidental occurrences in the amount of at least $1 million per\noccurrence, with an annual aggregate of at least $2 million, exclusive of legal\ndefense costs. This liability coverage may be demonstrated as specified in\nsubparagraph (i), (ii) (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of this paragraph. (i) An owner or operator may demonstrate the\nrequired liability coverage by having liability insurance as specified in this\nparagraph. (a) Each insurance policy must be\namended by attachment of the Hazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement or\nevidenced by a Certificate of Liability Insurance. The wording of the\nendorsement must be identical to the wording specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(7)\nof\nthis Part. The wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the\nwording specified in paragraph (j)(8) of such section. The owner or operator\nmust submit a signed duplicate original of the endorsement or the certificate\nof insurance to the commissioner. If requested by the commissioner, the owner\nor operator must provide a signed duplicate original of the insurance\npolicy. (b) Each insurance policy\nmust be issued by an insurer which, at a minimum, is licensed to transact the\nbusiness of insurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus\nlines insurer, within New York State by the Superintendent of the New York\n\nState Department of Financial Services. (ii)\n\nAn owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility may meet the requirements of this paragraph\nby passing a financial test or using the guarantee for liability coverage as\nspecified in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision. If the firm which is\nproviding the guarantee does not meet the definition of revenue-oriented in\nsection\n373-2.8\nor\n373-3.8\nof this Part, it may\nprovide the guarantee on behalf of the owner or operator even if the owner or\noperator is a revenue-oriented facility. For a revenue-oriented facility, the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator cannot be consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. (iii)\n\nAn owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a letter of credit for liability\ncoverage as specified in paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nAn owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a surety bond for liability\ncoverage as specified in paragraph (9) of this subdivision. (v) An owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a trust fund for liability coverage\nas specified in paragraph (10) of this subdivision. (vi)\n\nAn owner or operator may demonstrate the\nrequired liability coverage through the use of combinations of insurance, financial test, guarantee, letter of credit, surety bond, and trust fund, except that the owner or operator may not combine a financial test covering\npart of the liability coverage requirement with a guarantee unless the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator is not consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. The amounts of coverage demonstrated must\ntotal at least the minimum amounts required by this paragraph. If the owner or\noperator demonstrates the required coverage through the use of a combination of\nfinancial assurances under this paragraph, the owner or operator shall specify\nat least one such assurance as primary coverage and shall specify other\nassurances as excess coverage. An owner or operator of a revenue-oriented\nfacility may use all of the above- mentioned financial mechanisms except the\nfinancial test and/or guarantee. (vii)\n\nAn owner or operator shall notify the\ncommissioner in writing within 30 days whenever: (a) a claim results in a reduction in the\namount of financial assurance for liability coverage provided by a financial\ninstrument authorized in subparagraphs (i) through (vi) of this paragraph; or\n(b) a certification of valid\nclaim for bodily injury or property damages caused by a sudden or nonsudden\naccidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste\ntreatment, storage, or disposal facility is entered between the owner and\nthird-party claimant for liability coverage under subparagraphs (i) through\n(vi) of this paragraph; or\n(c) a\nfinal court order establishing a judgment for bodily injury or property damage\ncaused by a sudden or nonsudden accidental occurrence arising from the\noperation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility is\nissued against the owner or operator or an instrument that is providing\nfinancial assurance for liability coverage under subparagraphs (i) through (vi)\nof this paragraph. (2)\n\nCoverage for nonsudden accidental\noccurrences. An owner or operator of a surface impoundment, landfill\nor land treatment facility which is used to manage hazardous waste, or a group\nof such facilities, must demonstrate financial responsibility for bodily injury\nand property damage to third parties caused by nonsudden accidental occurrences\narising from operations of the facility or group of facilities. The owner or\noperator must have and maintain liability coverage for nonsudden accidental\noccurrences in the amount of at least $4.5 million per occurrence, with an\nannual aggregate of at least $9 million, exclusive of legal defense costs, for\neach separate facility in New York State. An owner or operator who must meet\nthe requirements of this paragraph may combine the required per-occurrence\ncoverage levels for sudden and nonsudden accidental occurrences into a single\nper-occurrence level, and combine the required annual aggregate coverage levels\nfor sudden and nonsudden accidental occurrences into a single annual aggregate\nlevel. Owners or operators who combine coverage levels for sudden and nonsudden\naccidental occurrences must maintain liability coverage in the amount of at\nleast $5.5 million per occurrence and $11 million annual aggregate. This\nliability coverage may be demonstrated as specified in subparagraph (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of this paragraph. (i) An owner or operator may demonstrate the\nrequired liability coverage by having liability insurance as specified in this\nparagraph. (a) Each insurance policy must be\namended by attachment of the Hazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement or\nevidenced by a Certificate of Liability Insurance. The wording of the\nendorsement must be identical to the wording specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(7)\nof\nthis Part. The wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the\nwording specified in paragraph (j)(8) of such section. The owner or operator\nmust submit a signed duplicate original of the endorsement or the certificate\nof insurance to the commissioner. If requested by the commissioner, the owner\nor operator must provide a signed duplicate original of the insurance\npolicy. (b) Each insurance policy\nmust be issued by an insurer which, at a minimum, is licensed to transact the\nbusiness of insurance, or authorized to provide insurance as an excess or\nsurplus lines insurer, within New York State by the Superintendent of the New\n\nYork State Insurance Department. (ii)\n\nAn owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility may meet the requirements of this paragraph\nby passing a financial test or using the guarantee for liability coverage as\nspecified in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision. If the firm which is\nproviding the guarantee does not meet the definition of revenue-oriented in\nsection\n373-2.8\nor\n373-3.8\nof this Part, it may\nprovide the guarantee on behalf of the owner or operator even if the owner or\noperator is a revenue-oriented facility. For a revenue-oriented facility, the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator cannot be consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. (iii)\n\nAn owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a letter of credit for liability\ncoverage as specified in paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nAn owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a surety bond for liability\ncoverage as specified in paragraph (9) of this subdivision. (v) An owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a trust fund for liability coverage\nas specified in paragraph (10) of this subdivision. (vi)\n\nAn owner or operator may demonstrate the\nrequired liability coverage through the use of combinations of insurance, financial test, guarantee, letter of credit, surety bond, and trust fund, except that the owner or operator may not combine a financial test covering\npart of the liability coverage requirement with a guarantee unless the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator is not consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. The amounts of coverage demonstrated must\ntotal at least the minimum amounts required by this paragraph. If the owner or\noperator demonstrates the required coverage through the use of a combination of\nfinancial assurances under this paragraph, the owner or operator shall specify\nat least one such assurance as primary coverage and shall specify other\nassurances as excess coverage. An owner or operator of a revenue-oriented\nfacility may use all of the above- mentioned financial mechanisms except the\nfinancial test and/or guarantee. (vii)\n\nAn owner or operator shall notify the\ncommissioner in writing within 30 days whenever: (a) a claim results in a reduction in the\namount of financial assurance for liability coverage provided by a financial\ninstrument authorized in subparagraphs (i) through (vi) of this paragraph; or\n(b) a certification of valid\nclaim for bodily injury or property damages caused by a sudden or nonsudden\naccidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste\ntreatment, storage, or disposal facility is entered between the owner or\noperator and third-party claimant for liability coverage under subparagraphs\n(i) through (vi) of this paragraph; or\n(c) a final court order establishing a\njudgement for bodily injury or property damage caused by a sudden or nonsudden\naccidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste\ntreatment, storage, or disposal facility is issued against the owner or\noperator or an instrument that is providing financial assurance for liability\ncoverage under subparagraphs (i) through (vi) of this paragraph. (3)\n\nRequest for\nvariance. If an owner or operator can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the\ncommissioner, that the levels of financial responsibility required by paragraph\n(1) or (2) of this subdivision are not consistent with the degree and duration\nof risk associated with treatment, storage or disposal at the facility or group\nof facilities, the owner or operator may obtain a variance from the\ncommissioner. The request for a variance must be submitted in writing to the\ncommissioner. If granted, the variance will take the form of an adjusted level\nof required liability coverage, such level to be based on the commissioner' s\nassessment of the degree and duration of risk associated with the ownership or\noperation of the facility or group of facilities. The commissioner may require\nan owner or operator who requests a variance to provide such technical and\nengineering information as is deemed necessary by the commissioner to determine\na level of financial responsibility other than that required by paragraph (1)\nor (2) of this subdivision. The commissioner will process a variance request as\nif it were a permit modification request under section\n373-1.7\nof this Part, and subject\nto the procedures of Part 621 of this Title. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision, the commissioner may hold a public hearing at his or her discretion\nor whenever the commissioner finds, on the basis of requests for a public\nhearing, a significant degree of public interest in a tentative decision to\ngrant a variance. (4)\n\nAdjustments\nby the commissioner. If the commissioner determines that the levels of\nfinancial responsibility required by paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision\nare not consistent with the degree and duration of risk associated with\ntreatment, storage or disposal at the facility or group of facilities, the\ncommissioner may adjust the level of financial responsibility required under\nparagraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision as may be necessary to protect human\nhealth and the environment. This adjusted level will be based on the\ncommissioner' s assessment of the degree and duration of risk associated with\nthe ownership or operation of the facility or group of facilities. In addition, if the commissioner determines that there is a significant risk to human health\nand the environment from nonsudden accidental occurrences resulting from the\noperations of a facility that is not a surface impoundment, landfill or land\ntreatment facility, the commissioner may require that an owner or operator of\nthe facility comply with paragraph (2) of this subdivision. An owner or\noperator must furnish to the commissioner, within a reasonable time, any\ninformation which the commissioner requests to determine whether cause exists\nfor such adjustments of level or type of coverage. The commissioner will\nprocess an adjustment of the level of required coverage as if it were a permit\nmodification under section\n373-1.7\nof this Part, and subject\nto the procedures of Part 621 of this Title. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision, the commissioner may hold a public hearing at his or her discretion\nor whenever the commissioner finds, on the basis of requests for a public\nhearing, a significant degree of public interest in a tentative decision to\nadjust the level or type of required coverage. (5)\n\nPeriod of coverage. Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the\nowner or operator and an independent professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork that final closure has been completed in accordance with the approved\nclosure plan, the commissioner will notify the owner or operator in writing\nthat the owner or operator is no longer required by this subdivision to\nmaintain liability coverage for that facility, unless the commissioner has\nreason to believe that closure has not been in accordance with the approved\nclosure plan. (6)\n\nFinancial\ntest for liability coverage. An owner or operator of a facility which is not a\nrevenue-oriented facility may satisfy the requirements of this subdivision by\ndemonstrating that the owner or operator passes a financial test as specified\nin this paragraph. To pass this test, the owner or operator must meet the\ncriteria of subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph: (i) The owner or operator must have: (a) net working capital and tangible net\nworth each at least six times the amount of liability coverage to be\ndemonstrated by this test; (b) tangible net worth of at least $10 million; and\n(c) assets in the United States amounting to\neither: (1)\nat least 90 percent of the total\nassets; or\n(2)\nat least six times\nthe amount of liability coverage to be demonstrated by this test. (ii)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must have: (a) a current rating for\ntheir most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A or BBB as issued by Standard and\n\nPoor's, or Aaa, Aa, A or Baa as issued by Moody's; (b) tangible net worth of at least $10\nmillion; (c) tangible net worth at\nleast six times the amount of liability coverage to be demonstrated by this\ntest; and\n(d) assets in the United\n\nStates amounting to either: (1)\nat least 90\npercent of the total assets; or\n(2)\nat least six times the amount of liability coverage to be demonstrated by this\ntest. (iii)\n\nThe phrase\namount of liability coverage, as used in\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, refers to the annual aggregate\namounts for which coverage is required under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision. (iv)\n\nTo demonstrate\nthat he or she meets this test, the owner or operator must submit the following\nthree items to the commissioner: (a) a letter\nsigned by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as\nspecified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(9)\nof\nthis Part. If an owner or operator is using the financial test to demonstrate\nboth assurance for closure or post-closure care, as specified by sections\n373-2.8\n(d)(5) and\n(f)(5), paragraphs (d)(5) and (f)(5) of this\nsection, and liability coverage, the letter specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(9)\nmust\nbe submitted to cover both forms of financial responsibility; a separate letter\nas specified in section\n373-2.8\n(j)(5)\nis\nnot required; (b) a copy of the\nindependent certified public accountant's report on examination of the owner's\nor operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and\n(c) a special report from the\nowner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or\noperator, stating that: (1)\nthe accountant has\ncompared the data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies\nas having been derived from the independently audited, year-end financial\nstatements for the latest fiscal year, with the amounts in such financial\nstatements; and\n(2)\nin connection\nwith that procedure, no matters came to the accountant's attention which caused\nthe acountant to believe that the specified data should be adjusted. (v) After the initial\nsubmission of items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, the\nowner or operator must send updated information to the commissioner within 90\ndays after the close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must\nconsist of all three items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. (vi)\n\nIf the owner or\noperator no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this\nparagraph, the owner or operator must obtain insurance, a letter of credit, a\nsurety bond, a trust fund, or a guarantee for the entire amount of required\nliability coverage as specified in this subdivision. Evidence of liability\ncoverage must be submitted to the commissioner within 90 days after the end of\nthe fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or\noperator no longer meets the test requirements.

For purposes of this paragraph, the full\namount of the liability coverage to be provided\nmeans the amount of\ncoverage for sudden and/or nonsudden occurrences required to be provided by the\nowner or operator by this subdivision, less the amount of financial assurance\nfor liability coverage that is being provided by other financial assurance\nmechanisms being used to demonstrate financial assurance by the owner or\noperator.
