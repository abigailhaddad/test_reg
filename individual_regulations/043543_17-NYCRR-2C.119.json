  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.119 - Safety Zone Sign (NYW9-5)\n\nState Regulations\n\nOption: 01 The Safety Zone (NYW9-5) sign (see Sign Drawing SD-W34)\nmay be used to warn of pedestrian safety zones established pursuant to Section\n141 of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law. Support: 02 Pedestrian safety zones are channelizing islands, established for pedestrian protection, where traffic may pass on either side. The Safety Zone sign is similar in function to the W12-1 sign (see Section\n2C.25) as traffic is allowed to pass on either side of the island. Guidance: 03 Where traffic must pass on one side of the pedestrian\nsafety zone, a Keep Right (R4-7) or Keep Left (R4-8) sign (see Section\n2B.32\n) should be used. 04 Where used, the Safety Zone sign should be placed in the\npedestrian safety zone, as close as practicable to the approach end, facing\napproaching traffic. It should be placed at a height of at least seven\nfeet. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.119\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
