Critical work areas shall have a positive pressure gradient greater than or equal to 0.05 inches of water relative to an adjacent less clean area. Critical surfaces shall be sterile and shall not interact with the tissue so as to affect the quality of the tissue adversely. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
