  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 454.4 - Metering\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Transmission\nmetering. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable service tariff or other\ncontract documents, the total electric power and energy delivered to customer\nwill be measured alone or in conjunction with deliveries to others by metering\nequipment to be furnished and maintained by authority. The meter or meters\nshall be sealed and the seals shall be broken only upon occasions when the\nmeters are to be inspected, tested or adjusted, and representatives of customer\nshall be afforded reasonable opportunity to be present upon such occasions. The\nmeter or meters shall be tested at least once each year by authority and at any\nreasonable time upon request therefor by either authority or customer. Any\nmetering equipment found to be defective or inaccurate shall be repaired and\nreadjusted or replaced. Should any meter fail to register, the electric power\nand energy delivered during the period of failure to register shall, for\nbilling purposes, be estimated by authority from the best information\navailable. (b) Delivery and service\nmetering. (1)\n\nWhere delivery and service (as\ndistinguished from transmission) are carried out through the systems of others\nand by the personnel of others, the total electric power and energy, including\nreactive power and energy where authority deems appropriate, transmitted or\ndelivered to a customer (as distinguished from transmitted over the facilities\nof others) will be measured by metering equipment and measuring devices to be\nfurnished and maintained by either authority or the utility providing delivery\nand service. Seals on meters, meter equipment and associated equipment shall be\nbroken only upon occasions when the meters and measuring devices are to be\ninspected, tested, or adjusted. No person, except a duly authorized and\nidentified representative of authority or the utility providing delivery and\nservice, shall be permitted to break or replace a seal or to alter or change a\nmeter of its connections or location, except when wiring changes are being made\nby customer following receipt of appropriate specifications of authority or the\nutility providing delivery and service as to service supply. In such case, a\nqualified electrician may break the meter seal and remove and remount a meter\nwhen authorized to do so by authority and/or by the utility providing delivery\nand service, whichever seals such meter. Meters owned by the authority or the\nutility providing delivery and service shall be tested by authority or such\nutility providing delivery and service as mutually determined by\nthem. (2)\n\nShould any meter fail to\nregister for any period of time, or if the actual power and energy usage cannot\nbe measured because of inability to read a meter or other measuring device, the\nelectric power and energy delivered during such period shall, for billing\npurposes, be estimated by authority from the best information available, and\ncustomer billed accordingly. (3)\n\nExcept as provided in this section, customer shall not permit access by anyone, except authorized representatives of authority or the utility providing\ndelivery and service, to the meter equipment or any other property of authority\nor the utility providing delivery and service, and shall not interfere or\npermit interference with such equipment. Customer shall be responsible for\ntheir safekeeping on his premises. Duly authorized representatives of authority\nand the utility providing delivery and service shall have the right to access\nto the premises of customer and to all appropriate property of authority or the\nutility providing delivery and service to all reasonable times for the purpose\nof reading and testing meters, inspecting equipment used in connection with its\nservice, repairing, readjusting, or replacing defective or inaccurate meters, metering the demand, ascertaining and counting the connected load of customer's\ninstallation, removing its property, or any other purpose. (c) Meters errors. If any of the meter tests\nprovided for in this section discloses that the error of any meter or meters\nexceeds two percent correction based upon the inaccuracy found shall be made of\nthe records of electric service furnished since the beginning of the monthly\nbilling period immediately preceding the billing period during which the test\nwas made; provided, that no correction shall be made for a longer period than\nsuch inaccuracy may be determined by authority to have existed. Any correction\nin billing resulting from such correction in meter records shall be made in the\nnext monthly bill rendered by authority to customer, and such correction when\nmade shall constitute full adjustment of any claim between customer and\nauthority arising out of such inaccuracy of meters.
