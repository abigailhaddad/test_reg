  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.507 - Test requirements for pipelines to operate at less than 125 PSIG (862 kPa)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except\nfor service lines, each segment of a pipeline that is to be operated at less\nthan 125 psig (862 kPa) must be tested in accordance with this\nsection. (b) The test pressure\nshall be 90 psig (621 kPa) or 1.5 times the maximum operating pressure\nwhichever is greater; however, the maximum test pressure for plastic pipelines\nmay not be more than three times the design pressure for the pipe determined\nunder section\n255.121\nof this Part, at a\ntemperature not less than the pipe temperature during the test. During the\ntest, the temperature of thermoplastic material may not be more than 100° F\n(38°C), or the temperature at which the material's long-term hydrostatic\nstrength has been determined under the listed specification, whichever is\ngreater. (c) The test medium shall\nbe water, inert gas or air. (d) Except as provided in subdivision (f) of this section, the test must be\nconducted by maintaining the pressure at or above the test pressure for at\nleast one hour after stabilization. For fabricated units and short sections of\npipe, for which a post installation test is impractical, a preinstallation\nhydrostatic pressure test must be conducted in accordance with the requirements\nof this section. (e) A calibrated\npressure gauge that will indicate increments of two psig (14 kPa) or less shall\nbe attached to the test section. (f) For plastic insertions of less than 1500 feet\n(457.2 meters) length, the test duration may be 30 minutes prior to insertion\nfollowed by a 30 minute test after insertion and an inspection of all visible\nportions of the pipe for damage.
