  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.14 - Individual agency procedures to implement seqr\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Article 8 of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law requires all agencies to adopt and publish, after public\nhearing, any additional procedures that may be necessary for them to implement\nSEQR. Until an agency adopts these additional procedures, its implementation of\nSEQR will be governed by the provisions of this Part. If an agency rescinds its\nadditional SEQR procedures, it will continue to be governed by this Part. The\nagency must promptly notify the commissioner, and the commissioner shall\npublish a notice in the ENB, of the adoption of additional procedures or the\nrescission of agency SEQR procedures. (b) To the greatest extent possible, the\nprocedures prescribed in this Part must be incorporated into existing agency\nprocedures. An agency may, by local law, code, ordinance, executive order, resolution or regulation vary the time periods established in this Part for the\npreparation and review of SEQR documents, and for the conduct of public\nhearings, in order to coordinate the SEQR environmental review process with\nother procedures relating to the review and approval of actions. Such time\nchanges must not impose unreasonable delay. Individual agency procedures to\nimplement SEQR must be no less protective of environmental values, public\nparticipation and agency and judicial review than the procedures contained in\nthis Part. This Part supersedes any SEQR provisions promulgated or enacted by\nan agency that are less protective of the environment. (c) Agencies may find it helpful to seek the\nadvice and assistance of other agencies, groups and persons on SEQR matters, including the following: (1)\nadvice on\npreparation and review of EAF's; (2)\nrecommendations on the significance or\nnonsignificance of actions; (3)\npreparation and review of EISs and recommendations on the scope, adequacy, and\ncontents of EISs; (4)\npreparation\nand filing of SEQR notices and documents; (5)\nconduct of public hearings; and\n(6)\nrecommendations to\ndecisionmakers. (d) Agencies are strongly encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements with\nother agencies regularly involved in carrying out or approving the same actions\nfor the purposes of coordinating their procedures. (e) All agencies are subject to the lists of\n\nType I and Type II actions contained in this Part, and must apply the criteria\nprovided in section\n617.7\n(c) of this Part. In addition, agencies may adopt their own lists of Type I\nactions, in accordance with section\n617.4\nof this Part\nand their own lists of Type II actions in accordance with section\n617.5\nof this\n\nPart. (f) Every agency that adopts, has adopted or amends SEQR procedures must, after public hearing, file them\nwith the commissioner, who will maintain them to serve as a resource for\nagencies and interested persons. The commissioner will provide notice in the\nENB of such procedures upon filing. All agencies that have promulgated their\nown SEQR procedures must review and bring them into conformance with this Part. Until agencies do so, their procedures, where inconsistent or less protective, are superseded by this Part. (g) A\nlocal agency may designate a specific geographic area within its boundaries as\na critical environmental area (CEA). A state agency may also designate as a CEA\na specific geographic area that is owned or managed by the state or is under\nits regulatory authority. Designation of a CEA must be preceded by written\npublic notice and a public hearing. The public notice must identify the\nboundaries and the specific environmental characteristics of the area\nwarranting CEA designation. (1)\n\nTo be\ndesignated as a CEA, an area must have an exceptional or unique character\ncovering one or more of the following: (i) a\nbenefit or threat to human health; (ii)\na natural setting (e.g., fish and\nwildlife habitat, forest and vegetation, open space and areas of important\naesthetic or scenic quality); (iii)\nagricultural, social, cultural, historic, archaeological, recreational, or\neducational values; or\n(iv)\nan\ninherent ecological, geological or hydrological sensitivity to change that may\nbe adversely affected by any change. (2)\n\nNotification that an area has been\ndesignated as a CEA must include a map at an appropriate scale to readily\nlocate the boundaries of the CEA, the written justification supporting the\ndesignation, and proof of public hearing and, must be filed with: (i) the commissioner; (ii)\nthe appropriate regional office of the\ndepartment; and\n(iii)\nany other\nagency regularly involved in undertaking, funding or approving actions in the\nmunicipality in which the area has been designated. (3)\n\nThis designation shall take effect 30\ndays after filing with the commissioner. Each designation of a CEA must be\npublished in the ENB by the department and the department will serve as a\nclearinghouse for information on CEAs. (4)\n\nFollowing designation, the potential\nimpact of any Type I or Unlisted Action on the environmental characteristics of\nthe CEA is a relevant area of environmental concern and must be evaluated in\nthe determination of significance prepared pursuant to section\n617.7\nof\nthis Part.
