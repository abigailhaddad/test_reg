APPENDIX E\nProcedures for questioning, challenging and\nselecting jurors authorized by section\n202.33\nof the Rules of the Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts. A. General principles applicable to jury\nselection.Selection of jurors pursuant to any of the methods authorized by\nsection\n202.33\n(e) of the\n\nRules of the Chief Administrator shall be governed by the following: (1)\n\nIf for any reason jury\nselection cannot proceed immediately, counsel shall return promptly to the\ncourtroom of the assigned trial judge or the Trial Assignment Part or any other\ndesignated location for further instructions. (2)\n\nGenerally, a total of eight jurors, including two alternates, shall be selected. The court may permit a greater\nnumber of alternates if a lengthy trial is expected or for any appropriate\nreason. Counsel may consent to the use of \"nondesignated\" alternate jurors, in\nwhich event no distinction shall be made during jury selection between jurors\nand alternates, but the number of peremptory challenges in such cases shall\nconsist of the sum of the peremptory challenges that would have been available\nto challenge both jurors and designated alternates. (3)\n\nAll prospective jurors shall\ncomplete a background questionnaire supplied by the court in a form approved by\nthe Chief Administrator. Prior to the commencement of jury selection, completed\nquestionnaires shall be made available to counsel. Upon completion of jury\nselection, or upon removal of a prospective juror, the questionnaires shall be\neither returned to the respective jurors or collected and discarded by court\nstaff in a manner that ensures juror privacy. With Court approval, which shall\ntake into consideration concern for juror privacy, the parties may supplement\nthe questionnaire to address concerns unique to a specific case. (4)\n\nDuring the voir dire each\nattorney may state generally the contentions of his or her client, and identify\nthe parties, attorneys and the witnesses likely to be called. However, counsel\nmay not read from any of the pleadings in the action or inform potential jurors\nof the amount of money at issue. (5)\n\nCounsel shall exercise peremptory\nchallenges outside of the presence of the panel of prospective\njurors. (6)\n\nCounsel\nshall avoid discussing legal concepts such as burden of proof, which are the\nprovince of the court. (7)\n\nIf an unusual delay or a lengthy\ntrial is anticipated, counsel may so advise prospective jurors. (8)\n\nIf counsel objects to\nanything said or done by any other counsel during the selection process, the\nobjecting counsel shall unobtrusively request that all counsel step outside of\nthe juror's presence, and counsel shall make a determined effort to resolve the\nproblem. Should that effort fail, counsel shall immediately bring the problem\nto the attention of the assigned trial judge, the Trial Assignment Part judge\nor any other designated judge. (9)\n\nAfter jury selection is completed, counsel shall advise the clerk of the assigned Trial Part or of the Trial\n\nAssignment Part or other designated part. If counsel anticipates the need\nduring trial of special equipment (if available) or special assistance, such as\nan interpreter, counsel shall so inform the clerk at that time. B. \"White's Method\"\n(1)\n\nPrior to the identification\nof the prospective jurors to be seated in the jury box, counsel shall ask\nquestions generally to all of the jurors in the room to determine whether any\nprospective juror in the room has knowledge of the subject matter, the parties, their attorneys or the prospective witnesses. A response from a juror that\nrequires elaboration may be the subject of further questioning of that juror by\ncounsel on an individual basis. Counsel may exercise challenges for cause at\nthis time. (2)\n\nAfter\ngeneral questions have been asked to the group of prospective jurors, jury\nselection shall continue in rounds, with each round to consist of the\nfollowing: (1)\nseating\nprospective jurors in the jury box; (2)\nquestioning of seated prospective\njurors; and (3) removal of seated prospective jurors upon exercise of\nchallenges. Jurors removed for cause shall immediately be replaced during each\nround. The first round shall begin initially with the seating of six\nprospective jurors (where undesignated alternates are used, additional\nprospective jurors equal to the number of alternate jurors shall be seated as\nwell). (3)\n\nIn each\nround, the questioning of the seated prospective jurors shall be conducted\nfirst by counsel for the plaintiff, followed by counsel for the remaining\nparties in the order in which their names appear in the caption. Counsel may be\npermitted to ask follow-up questions. Within each round, challenges for cause\nshall be exercised by any party prior to the exercise of peremptory challenges\nand as soon as the reason therefor becomes apparent. Upon replacement of a\nprospective juror removed for cause, questioning shall revert to the\nplaintiff. (4)\n\nFollowing questioning and the exercise of challenges for cause, peremptory\nchallenges shall be exercised one at a time and alternately as follows: In the\nfirst round, in caption order, each attorney shall exercise one peremptory\nchallenge by removing a prospective juror's name from a \"board\" passed back and\nforth between or among counsel. An attorney alternatively may waive the making\nof a peremptory challenge. An attorney may exercise a second, single peremptory\nchallenge within the round only after all other attorneys have either exercised\nor waived their first peremptory challenges. The board shall continue to\ncirculate among the attorneys until no other peremptory challenges are\nexercised. An attorney who waives a challenge may not thereafter exercise a\nperemptory challenge within the round, but may exercise remaining peremptory\nchallenges in subsequent rounds. The counsel last able to exercise a peremptory\nchallenge in a round is not confined to the exercise of a single challenge but\nmay then exercise one or more peremptory challenges. (5)\n\nIn subsequent rounds, the\nfirst exercise of peremptory challenges shall alternate from side to side. Where a side consists of multiple parties, commencement of the exercise of\nperemptory challenges in subsequent rounds shall rotate among the parties\nwithin the side. In each such round, before the board is to be passed to the\nother side, the board must be passed to all remaining parties within the side, in caption order, starting from the first party in the rotation for that\nround. (6)\n\nAt the end\nof each round, those seated jurors who remain unchallenged shall be sworn and\nremoved from the room. The challenged jurors shall be replaced, and a new round\nshall commence. (7)\n\nThe selection of designated alternate jurors shall take place after the\nselection of the six jurors. Designated alternate jurors shall be selected in\nthe same manner as described above, with the order of exercise of peremptory\nchallenges continuing as the next round following the last completed round of\nchallenges to regular jurors. The total number of peremptory challenges to\nalternates may be exercised against any alternate, regardless of\nseat. C. \"Struck Method\"\n(1)\n\nUnless otherwise ordered by the\n\nCourt, selection of jurors shall be made from an initial panel of 25\nprospective jurors, who shall be seated randomly and who shall maintain the\norder of seating throughout the voir dire. If fewer prospective jurors are\nneeded due to the use of designated alternate jurors or for any other reason, the size of the panel may be decreased. (2)\n\nCounsel first shall ask questions\ngenerally to the prospective jurors as a group to determine whether any\nprospective juror has knowledge of the subject matter, the parties, their\nattorneys or the prospective witnesses. A response from a juror that requires\nfurther elaboration may be the subject of further questioning of that juror by\ncounsel on an individual basis. Counsel may exercise challenges for cause at\nthis time. (3)\n\nAfter\nthe general questioning has been completed, in an action with one plaintiff and\none defendant, counsel for the plaintiff initially shall question the\nprospective jurors, followed by questioning by defendant's counsel. Counsel may\nbe permitted to ask follow-up questions. In cases with multiple parties, questioning shall be undertaken by counsel in the order in which the parties'\nnames appear in the caption. A challenge for cause may be made by counsel to\nany party as soon as the reason therefor becomes apparent. At the end of the\nperiod, all challenges for cause to any prospective juror on the panel must\nhave been exercised by respective counsel. (4)\n\nAfter challenges for cause are\nexercised, the number of prospective jurors remaining shall be counted. If that\nnumber is less than the total number of jurors to be selected (including\nalternates, where non-designated alternates are being used) plus the maximum\nnumber of peremptory challenges allowed by the court or by statute that may be\nexercised by the parties (such sum shall be referred to as the \"jury panel\nnumber\"), additional prospective jurors shall be added until the number of\nprospective jurors not subject to challenge for cause equals or exceeds the\njury panel number. Counsel for each party then shall question each replacement\njuror pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph (3). (5)\n\nAfter all prospective jurors\nin the panel have been questioned, and all challenges for cause have been made, counsel for each party, one at a time beginning with counsel for the plaintiff, shall then exercise allowable peremptory challenges by alternately striking a\nsingle juror's name from a list or ballot passed back and forth between or\namong counsel until all challenges are exhausted or waived. In cases with\nmultiple plaintiffs and/or defendants, peremptory challenges shall be exercised\nby counsel in the order in which the parties' names appear in the caption, unless following that order would, in the opinion of the court, unduly favor a\nside. In that event, the court, after consulting with the parties, shall\nspecify the order in which the peremptory challenges shall be exercised in a\nmanner that shall balance the interests of the parties. An attorney who waives\na challenge may not thereafter exercise a peremptory challenge. Any Batson or\nother objections shall be resolved by the court before any of the struck jurors\nare dismissed. (6)\n\nAfter all peremptory challenges have been made, the trial jurors (including\nalternates when non-designated alternates are used) then shall be selected in\nthe order in which they have been seated from those prospective jurors\nremaining on the panel. (7)\n\nThe selection of designated alternate\njurors shall take place after the selection of the six jurors. Counsel shall\nselect designated alternates in the same manner set forth in these rules, but\nwith an initial panel of not more than 10 prospective alternates unless\notherwise directed by the court. The jury panel number for designated alternate\njurors shall be equal to the number of alternates plus the maximum number of\nperemptory challenges allowed by the court or by statute that may be exercised\nby the parties. The total number of peremptory challenges to alternates may be\nexercised against any alternate, regardless of seat. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
