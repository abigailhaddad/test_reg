Tit. 5 § 143.3 - Work force diversity bidding and award requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) State agencies shall require as part of\nall bid requests and contract solicitations that the contractor submit to the\ncontracting agency an EEO policy statement and, may require, a staffing plan, as described in section\n143.2\nof this Part. A contracting\nagency's approved master goal plan may specify, with reasons, that the\npre-award submission of a staffing plan will not be required for particular\ncontracts. (b) Prior to the award\nof a State contract and in the case where the work force to be utilized in the\nperformance of the State contract cannot be separated out from the contractor's\nand/or subcontractor's total work force (for example, certain commodities\ncontracts), the contractor shall, where required by the contracting agency, submit to the contracting agency, in lieu of a staffing plan, information on\nthe contractor's and/or subcontractor's total work force broken down by ethnic\nbackground, gender, and federal occupational categories or other appropriate\ncategories specified by the contracting agency. (c) A contractor's failure to submit an EEO\npolicy statement and, where required by the contracting agency, staffing plan\nor total work force data shall result in the rejection of the contractor's bid\nor proposal, unless the contractor provides the contracting agency with a\nreasonable justification in writing for such failure (e.g., the failure to\nsubmit a staffing plan where a contractor has a work force of 10 employees or\nless), or makes a commitment to submit an EEO policy statement and a staffing\nplan or total work force data by a date to be specified by the contracting\nagency. (d) The contracting agency\nshall be responsible for determining the time frames for the pre-award\nsubmission of the EEO policy statement and staffing plan or total work force\ndata and for determining whether all bidders or only the lowest responsible\nbidder(s) or finalists shall be required to submit such\ndocumentation. (e) After the award\nof the State contract and in the case where the work force to be utilized in\nthe performance of the State contract can be separated out from the\ncontractor's and/or subcontractor's total work force, a contracting agency may\nrequire the contractor to submit a work force employment utilization report in\na form developed by the director. In instances where such a report is required, the work force employment utilization report form shall be provided to the\ncontractor by the contracting agency at the time of the execution of the\ncontract. The work force utilization report shall include the following\ninformation: (1)\nthe total number of employees\nperforming work on the State contract; (2)\nfor commodities, services/consulting, and\nprofessional construction consultant contracts (including not-for-profit\ncontracts within those industries), the contractor's and all subcontractor's\nwork force on the State contract broken down by specified ethnic background, gender, and federal occupational categories; and\n(3)\nfor construction contracts, the hours a\ncontractor's and all subcontractor's employees worked on activities related to\nthat contract, and a breakdown of those hours by ethnic background, gender and\nthe construction related job titles that fall within relevant federal\noccupational categories. (f) For construction contracts, a contractor\nshall submit to the contracting agency a work force utilization report on a\nmonthly basis throughout the life of the contract. (g) For all other contracts where the work\nforce to be utilized in the performance of the State contract can be separated\nout from the contractor's and/or subcontractor's total work force, the\ncontracting agency shall require a contractor to submit work force utilization\nreports on a quarterly basis throughout the life of the contract when the\ncontractor's and/or subcontractor's work force on the State contract changes. In the case where the contractor's and/or subcontractor's work force does not\nchange within the quarterly period, the contractor shall so notify the\ncontracting agency in writing. (h) After an award of the State contract and in the case where the work force to be\nutilized in the performance of the State contract cannot be separated out from\nthe contractor's and/or subcontractor's total work force, the contractor may\nsubmit to the contracting agency information on the contractor's and/or\nsubcontractor's total work force broken down by specified ethnic background, gender, and federal occupational categories. Such total work force data may be\nsubmitted by the contractor to the contracting agency on a semi-annual basis\nduring the life of the particular State contract or during the course of an\nextended and ongoing contractual relationship involving various State contracts\nentered into between the contractor and contracting agency. (i) For all State contracts that are bid and\nawarded by the Office of General Services, the Office of General Services shall\nbe solely responsible for requiring contractors to submit work force employment\nutilization reports and all other required information.
