  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 6-2.2 - Capital stock requirement\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-C)\n(a) A taxpayer and another corporation meet\nthe capital stock requirement if: (1)\nthe\ntaxpayer owns or controls, either directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the\nvoting power of the capital stock of another corporation; or\n(2)\nmore than 50% of the voting power of the\ncapital stock of the taxpayer is owned or controlled, either directly or\nindirectly, by another corporation; or\n(3)\nmore than 50% of the voting power of the\ncapital stock of the taxpayer and more than 50% of the voting power of the\ncapital stock of one or more other corporations are owned or controlled, either\ndirectly or indirectly, by the same interests. Whether or not the same\ninterests test is met will be determined based on the facts and circumstances\nof each case. The same interests include, but are not limited to, one or more\nalien, foreign or domestic corporations, partnerships, trusts or\nindividuals. (b) The\nterm \"capital stock of a corporation\" means the issued and outstanding stock of\nthe corporation. (c) The term\n\"ownership\" means actual or beneficial ownership, rather than mere record title\nas shown by the stock books of the corporation. To be considered the owner, the\nstockholder must have the right to vote and the right to receive any dividends\ndeclared. (d) The term \"control\"\nmeans all cases where one corporation directly or indirectly possesses the\npower to dictate or influence the management and policies of another\ncorporation through the direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the\nvoting power of the capital stock of that corporation. In addition, a\ncorporation controls the voting power of capital stock if it has been given the\nright to vote that stock by proxy or otherwise. The determination as to whether\nor not a corporation is controlled by or controls another corporation or is\ncontrolled by the same interests will be determined by the facts in each\ncase. (e) The term \"voting power of\ncapital stock of a corporation\" means the shares of stock, under the applicable\nlaw, corporate charter, articles of incorporation, or shareholder agreements, that have the power to elect the board of directors of the corporation. In\ndetermining whether the stock owned by a person or entity possesses a certain\npercentage of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a\ncorporation entitled to vote, consideration will be given to all the facts and\ncircumstances of each case. A share of stock generally will be considered as\npossessing the voting power accorded to that share by the corporate charter, bylaws, or share certificate. If there is any agreement, whether express or\nimplied, that a stockholder will not exercise its right to vote, the formal\nvoting rights possessed by that stock may be disregarded in determining the\npercentage of the total combined voting power possessed by that stockholder in\nthe corporation. Moreover, if a stockholder agrees to vote its stock in a\ncorporation in the manner specified by another stockholder in the corporation, the voting rights possessed by the stock owned by the first stockholder may be\nconsidered to be possessed by the stock owned by the other stockholder. For\ncontingent voting rights, the stock is deemed to possess voting power only when\nthe contingency occurs, and the rights become exercisable. (f) (1)\n\nThe\nownership test is applied before the control test. Direct ownership is examined\nbefore indirect ownership, and direct control is examined before indirect\ncontrol. However, the capital stock requirement may be satisfied through direct\nor indirect ownership, direct or indirect control or through a combination of\ndirect or indirect ownership or control. (2)\n\nExamples. The following examples are intended to illustrate the\nindicia of ownership and control set forth above. Generally, the examples are\nmeant to illustrate either ownership or control since both do not need to be\nmet concurrently in order for the capital stock requirement to be met. Example 1: The taxpayer, X Corporation, owns 40% of the\ncapital stock with voting rights of Y Corporation. The remaining capital stock\nof Y Corporation with voting rights is owned by three employees of X\nCorporation. These employees have agreed in writing to sell their stock to X\nCorporation when they leave the corporation. As part of the agreement, the\nemployees have given X Corporation their voting proxy. Thus, X Corporation\ncontrols more than 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of Y\nCorporation. X and Y Corporations satisfy the capital stock requirement to be\nincluded in a combined report. Example 2: The taxpayer, R Corporation, has issued 900\nshares of common stock with voting rights equal to one vote per share. These\nshares are owned by P Corporation. R Corporation has also issued 1,000 shares\nof preferred stock. These shares possess voting rights equal to one-tenth of\none vote (.10) per share of preferred stock. Those shares are owned by Q\nCorporation. Even though P Corporation owns less than 50% of the number of\nvoting shares (900 shares out of a total of 1,900 shares), it owns more than\n50% of the voting power of the capital stock of R Corporation (900 votes out of\na total of 1,000 votes). Thus, P Corporation and R Corporation satisfy the\ncapital stock requirement to be included in a combined report. While Q\nCorporation owns more than 50% of the number of shares of R Corporation (1,000\nshares out of a total of 1900 shares), it only owns one-tenth of the voting\npower of the capital stock of R Corporation (100 votes of a total of 1,000\nvotes). Q Corporation does not satisfy the capital stock requirement to be\nincluded in a combined report with P Corporation and R Corporation. Example 3: The taxpayer, Corporation A, owns 51% of the\ncapital stock of Corporation B. Corporation B in turn owns 51% of the capital\nstock of Corporation C. The capital stock in both corporations has voting\nrights. By owning 51% of the capital stock with voting rights of Corporation B, Corporation A controls more than 50% of the voting power of the capital stock\nof Corporation B. Because Corporation A controls more than 50% of the voting\npower of the capital stock of Corporation B, it also controls indirectly more\nthan 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation C. Corporations A, B and C satisfy the capital stock requirement to be included in\na combined report. Example 4: The taxpayer, Corporation A, is a 60% partner\nof Partnership Y, and is the general partner of Partnership Y. Partnership Y\nowns 40% of the capital stock with voting rights of Corporation B. Thus, Corporation A indirectly owns only 24% of the voting power of the capital stock\nof Corporation B (60% multiplied by 40%). However, because Corporation A holds\nmore than a 50% interest in Partnership Y and has the power to manage the\naffairs of the partnership under the operating agreement, it can control how\n\nPartnership Y votes its stock in Corporation B. Thus, Corporation A controls\nindirectly the voting power of the capital stock owned by Partnership Y. In\nthis case, because Partnership Y owns only 40% of the voting power of the\ncapital stock of Corporation B, Corporation A controls indirectly only 40% of\nthe voting power of the capital stock of Corporation B. Because Corporation A\ndoes not own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of voting power\nof the capital stock of Corporation B, Corporation A and Corporation B do not\nsatisfy the capital stock requirement to be included in a combined\nreport. Example 5: The taxpayer, Corporation A, has a 60%\nmembership interest in Limited Liability Company Y, which is treated as a\npartnership for tax purposes. Limited Liability Company Y owns 80% of the\ncapital stock with voting rights of Corporation B. Corporation A is considered\na managing member of Limited Liability Company Y, since the terms of the\noperating agreement do not impose limitations on the corporate member's\nparticipation in the management either equivalent to or more stringent than the\nlimitations on the participation in the control of the business of a limited\npartnership imposed on limited partners under article 8-A of the New York\n\nPartnership Law. Since Corporation A is a managing member of Limited Liability\n\nCompany Y, which in turn has greater than 50% voting power of the capital stock\nof B, Corporation A has the authority to direct how Limited Liability Company Y\nuses its voting power in Corporation B. Thus, Corporation A controls indirectly\nmore than 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation B, and\n\nCorporations A and B satisfy the capital stock requirement to be included in\nthe combined report. Example 6: The taxpayer, Corporation A, is an 80% limited\npartner of Partnership Y. Partnership Y owns 40% of the capital stock with\nvoting rights of Corporation B. Corporation A also directly owns 22% of the\ncapital stock with voting rights of Corporation B. Even though Corporation A\nhas an 80% interest in Partnership Y, Corporation A is a limited partner and\ncannot control how Partnership Y votes its stock in Corporation B. Thus, Corporation A does not control indirectly 40% of the voting power of the\ncapital stock of Corporation B, and so that 40% is not combined with the 22% of\nthe voting power of the capital stock of Corporation B that Corporation A\ncontrols directly through its ownership of Corporation B stock to determine if\n\nCorporation A controls more than 50% of the voting power of the capital stock\nof Corporation B. As a result, Corporations A and B do not meet the capital\nstock requirement and therefore cannot be included in a combined report. Example 7: The taxpayer, Corporation A, is a 60% general\npartner of Partnership Y. Partnership Y owns 40% of the capital stock with\nvoting rights of Corporation B. Corporation A also directly owns 30% of the\ncapital stock with voting rights of Corporation B. By combining its direct and\nindirect ownership of the stock of Corporation B, Corporation A owns, directly\nand indirectly, 54% of the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation B\n(30% plus 60% multiplied by 40%). Because Corporation A directly or indirectly\nowns more than 50% of the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation B, Corporations A and B satisfy the capital stock requirement to be included in a\ncombined report. Example 8: The taxpayer, Corporation A, owns 100% of the\nvoting power of the capital stock of Corporation B. Corporation B owns 51% of\nthe voting power of the capital stock of Corporation C. Corporation C owns 40%\nof the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation D. Individual X owns\n100% of the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation A and also owns\n20% of the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation D. Corporations A, B, C and D satisfy the capital stock requirement to be included in a combined\nreport because they are all directly or indirectly controlled by the same\ninterests (Individual X). Example 9: The taxpayer, Corporation A, owns 60% of the\ncapital stock with voting rights of Corporation C and 60% of the capital stock\nwith voting rights of Corporation D. Corporation B, also a taxpayer, owns 40%\nof the capital stock with voting rights of Corporation C and 40% of the capital\nstock with voting rights of Corporation D. Corporations C and D each own 30% of\nthe capital stock with voting rights of Corporation E. Corporation B directly\nowns the remaining 40% of the capital stock with voting rights of Corporation\nE. Corporation A directly owns more than 50% of the voting power of\n\nCorporations C and D. Corporation A, acting indirectly through its control of\n\nCorporations C and D, controls Corporation E. Corporation B directly and\nindirectly owns 64% of the voting power of the capital stock of Corporation E\n(B's 40% ownership of C multiplied by C's 30% ownership of E plus B's 40%\nownership of D multiplied by D's 30% ownership of E plus B's direct ownership\nof 40% of E). Corporations A, B, C, D and E satisfy the capital stock\nrequirement to be included in a combined report. Example 10: Individuals A, B, C and D each own 25% of the\nvoting stock of Corporations S and T. Because more than 50% of the ownership of\nthe voting stock of both corporations is owned by the same interests, Corporations S and T satisfy the capital stock requirement to be included in a\ncombined report.
