  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 500.2 - Types of meters\n\nState Regulations\n\nService meters covered by this Part in use for measuring\nwater delivered to consumers are divided into four general classes, as follows: displacement, current, compound, and fire-service. (a) Displacement meters. Displacement meters\nare known by the motion of the piston, as reciprocating, rotary, oscillating, and nutating disc meters. These meters are positive in action and displace or\ncarry over a fixed quantity for each stroke or revolution of the piston or\ndisc. (b) Current meters. Current\nmeters are nonpositive in action, but record the flow by the number of\nrevolutions of a water wheel or propeller, which is set in motion by the force\nof the flowing water coming in contact with the wheel or propeller\nblades. (c) Compound meters. Compound meters consist of a combination of a mainline meter of the current or\ndisplacement type for measuring large flows and a small by-pass meter of the\ndisplacement type for measuring small flows, together with an automatic valve\nmechanism for diverting the small flows through the by-pass meter. (d) Fire-service meters. Fire-service meters\nare compound meters consisting of a main-line meter of the proportional type\nfor measuring large flows and a small by-pass meter of the displacement type\nfor measuring small flows together with an automatic valve mechanism for\ndiverting the small flows through the by-pass meter. The combination is\ndesigned to afford a clear passage through the meter when the valve is raised\nfrom its seat. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n500.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
