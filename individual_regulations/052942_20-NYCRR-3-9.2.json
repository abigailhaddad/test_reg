  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-9.2 - Net operating loss deduction\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, sections 210, 210-C)\n(a) (1)\nA\ncorporation that reports as part of a consolidated group for Federal income tax\npurposes, but on a separate basis for purposes of article 9-A, computes its NOL\nand its net operating loss deduction (NOLD) as if it were filing on a separate\nbasis for Federal income tax purposes. (2)\n\nIf the combined group is different than\nthe consolidated group for Federal income tax purposes, then the combined group\ncomputes its NOL and NOLD as if it were filing a consolidated return for\n\nFederal income tax purposes with the combined group members. (b) The NOLD is not limited to the\n\nFederal NOLD amount. However, such deduction is determined using the same\nlimitations that would apply for Federal income tax purposes under the IRC and\nthe related regulations regarding the NOLs of the acquired or merged loss\ncompanies. (c) The NOLD that is\nrequired to be utilized in a taxable year is the amount that reduces the tax on\napportioned total business income after the prior net operating loss conversion\n(PNOLC) subtraction and prior to the NOLD to the higher of the tax on the\ncapital base or the fixed dollar minimum tax. In the case of a combined report, the NOLD that is required to be utilized in a taxable year is the amount that\nreduces the tax on apportioned total combined business income after the PNOLC\nsubtraction and prior to the NOLD to the higher of the tax on the combined\ncapital base or the fixed dollar minimum tax of the designated agent. (d) (1)\nA\ncorporation is allowed an NOLD in computing its business income base or, in the\ncase of a combined report, in computing the combined group's business income\nbase. (2)\n\nThe NOLD is the amount of\nNOL from one or more taxable years that is carried forward or carried back to a\nparticular taxable year, subject to the limitations in this Subpart. In the\ncase of a combined report, the NOLD is the aggregate amount of the combined\ngroup members\" NOL from one or more taxable years that is carried forward or\ncarried back to a particular taxable year, subject to the limitations in this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nWhen both a PNOLC\nsubtraction and an NOLD are being claimed for a particular taxable year, the\nPNOLC subtraction must be applied against the business income base before the\nNOLD. (e) A corporation\nwill not be allowed an NOLD for any NOL sustained in any of the taxable years\nlisted in paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this subdivision: (1)\na New York S year. The New York S year\nmust, however, be treated as a taxable year for purposes of determining the\nnumber of taxable years to which an NOL may be carried forward or\nback. (2)\nany taxable year\nbeginning prior to January 1, 2015; or\n(3)\nany taxable year in which the corporation\nwas not subject to tax under article 9-A or not a member of a combined group\nsubject to tax under article 9-A.
