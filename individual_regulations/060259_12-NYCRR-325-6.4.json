  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 325-6.4 - Objections to requests for reimbursement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Notice of objection by a carrier to any\nrequest for reimbursement by a health insurer shall be served on the health\ninsurer in accordance with section\n325-6.15\n(a) of\nthis Subpart, within 90 days after the date the HIMP-1 form was served on the\ncarrier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may mutually agree in\nwriting to extend the period in which the carrier must serve a notice of\nobjection. The basis for objection shall be specified on the HIMP-1 form or\ncopy thereof which was sent by the health insurer to the carrier. (b) The following issues may be interposed by\na carrier as objections to requests for reimbursement, in whole or in part, by\na health insurer: (1)\n\nThe compensability of\nthe claim has not been established or the workers' compensation case has been\nclosed without acceptance of the claim or findings of accident or occupational\ndisease, notice and causal relationship, or the compensability of the claim is\nthe subject of a pending application for review to the board or a pending\nappeal to the courts, and is not subject to arbitration and therefore the claim\nis not subject to reimbursement. (2)\n\nThe request for reimbursement has not\nbeen timely served in accordance with section\n325-6.2\nor section\n325-6.3\n(b) of\nthis Subpart. (3)\n\nThe treatment, services or hospitalization for which the health insurer made payments was on\nbehalf of a person other than the workers' compensation claimant, or was for a\ncondition or injury unrelated to the workers' compensation claim, or for\ntreatment of a part of the body for which causal relationship has not been\nestablished. (4)\n\nThe treatment, services or hospitalization for which the health insurer made payments were not\nfurnished on an emergency basis, and were obtained by the injured employee\nafter authorization for such treatment, services or hospitalization was\nrequested by the injured employee and such authorization was denied by a\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law judge or other duly designated board employee or such\nauthorization was denied by the carrier and the claimant or health care\nprovider did not seek a board or Workers' Compensation Law judge determination\non the denial. (5)\n\nThe fee was in\nexcess of the workers' compensation fee schedule or, in the case of inpatient\nhospital bills, in excess of the rate of payment for inpatient hospital\nservices established pursuant to the provisions of the Public Health Law, or\nthe proper fee schedule amount or rate of payment for inpatient hospital\nservices cannot be determined. In any case in which this objection is\ninterposed, the carrier must explain why the fee was in excess of the fee\nschedule or rate of payment or why the proper amount cannot be determined. If\nthis is the sole objection to the request for reimbursement, the carrier must\nstate the amount which it believes to be the proper amount and must pay the\nundisputed amount to the health insurer. (6)\n\nThe bill should have been pro-rated with\nanother physician or health provider. (7)\n\nThe carrier cannot determine from the\ndocumentation served whether it is responsible for payment. (8)\n\nThe carrier has previously reimbursed the\nhealth insurer or paid the health provider with respect to the claim. Proof of\npayment must be submitted. (9)\n\nThe\ntreatment was provided on or after the date that the board approved a waiver on\nthe part of the claimant to the right to medical treatment in connection with\nan agreement made pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law section 32. (10)\n\nThe carrier would not be obligated to\npay for the treatment pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law section 29 because\nthe claimant recovered proceeds from a third party and the corresponding\ncarrier lien or offset has not been extinguished. (11)\n\nThe treatment provided by a board\nauthorized provider was not consistent with the applicable medical treatment\nguidelines adopted by the board in section\n324.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. (c) In addition\nto the objections which may be interposed pursuant to subdivision (b) of this\nsection, a carrier may interpose any objection to a request for reimbursement\nwhich demonstrates that the request for reimbursement should not be made, unless such objection is specifically prohibited by subdivision (d) of this\nsection. (d) The following issues\nmay not be interposed as objections by a carrier to requests for reimbursement\nby a health insurer: (1)\n\nThe failure of a\nprovider to seek prior authorization for treatment pursuant to section\n13-a\n(5)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law and the\nrules and regulations promulgated there under. (2)\n\nThe failure of a provider to file notices\nand/or reports required by section\n13-a\n(4), 13-k\n(3), 13-l\n(3)\nor\n13-m\n(4)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law and the\nrules and regulations promulgated there under. (3)\n\nThe treatment was excessive or too\nfrequent, except as set forth in the applicable medical treatment guidelines\nadopted by the board in section\n324.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. (4)\n\nThe period of\nhospitalization was excessive and/or unnecessary, except as set forth in the\napplicable medical treatment guidelines adopted by the board in section\n324.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. (e) Where an\nobjection to a request for reimbursement has been made on any of the bases set\nforth in paragraphs (b)(4)-(10) and subdivision (c) of this section, the issues\ninterposed as objections shall be subject to mandatory arbitration. Where the\nbasis for the objection is the failure to establish ANCR, no such request for\nreimbursement is eligible for or subject to arbitration until the\ncompensability of the claim is established. (f) All objections to requests for\nreimbursement pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section must explain\nin detail the basis for the objection and must be accompanied by documentation\nsupporting the objection. Except as provided in sections\n325-6.6\n(c), 325-6.7\n(c) and\n325-6.11\n(c) of\nthis Subpart, no objections or supporting documents will be considered unless\nthey have been timely served on the health insurer in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Subpart.
