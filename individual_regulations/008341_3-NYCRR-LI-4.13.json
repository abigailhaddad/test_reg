  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.13 - Years of service to mutual savings banks in computing allowable pensions\n\nState Regulations\n\nMaximum allowable pensions in retiring savings bank employees\ncan under section\n250\nof the Banking\n\nLaw be increased, up to a stated limit, \"for each year of service\" by such\nemployee. The department was asked whether it would be permissible to include\nyears spent by the employee in service to other institutions prior to his\nemployment by the bank from which he is retiring. The department responded that it would regard it as within\nthe spirit as well as the letter of the law to permit inclusion of years of\nprior service to other New York savings banks, as well as to institutions owned\nin substantial entirety by one or more such banks during the entire period of\nthe employee's prior service. The department was not asked to pass on, and\nreserved for future judgment on a case-by-case basis, the legal acceptability\nof including prior service to savings banks in other States, commercial banks, State or Federal savings and loan associations, entities not substantially\nwholly owned by New York savings banks, and entities presently so owned but\nserved by the retiring employee before such ownership occurred. DATED: October 25, 1973\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 4.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
