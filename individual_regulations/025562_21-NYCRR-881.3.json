Tit. 21 § 881.3 - Exempt uses under the Compact\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section 15.1(b) of the Delaware River\n\nBasin Compact provides that \"no provision of section\n3.7\nof the Compact shall be deemed\nto authorize the commission to impose any charge for water withdrawals or\ndiversions from the basin if such withdrawals or diversions could lawfully have\nbeen made without charge on the effective date of the Compact;... \" In\ncompliance with this provision: There shall be no charge for water withdrawn or\ndiverted in quantities not exceeding the legal entitlement of the user, determined as of October 27, 1961. Each water user may submit proof\nsatisfactory to the commission of the factors constituting legal entitlement, as defined in subdivision (b) of this section. In the absence of such proof of\nthese conditions as of October 27, 1961, the quantity of water exempt from\ncharge to each user will be the legal entitlement of the user determined as of\n\nMarch 31, 1971. (b) For the purposes\nof subdivision (a) of this section: (1)\n\nLegal\nentitlement means the quantity or volume of water expressed in million gallons\nper month determined by the lesser of the following conditions: (i) a valid and subsisting permit, issued\nunder the authority of one of the signatory parties, if such permit was\nrequired as of October 27, 1961, or thereafter; (ii)\nphysical capability as required for such\ntaking; or\n(iii)\nthe total\nallocable flow without augmentation by the commission, using a seven-day, 10-year, low-flow criterion measured at the point of withdrawal or\ndiversion. (2)\n\nPhysical\ncapability means the capacity of pumps, water lines and appurtenances installed\nand operable, determined according to sound engineering principles. The\nphysical capability specifically includes plant facilities actually using\nwater, but excludes facilities which may have been installed in anticipation of\nfuture plant expansion not yet realized. (c) Whenever adequate records of legal\nentitlement for agricultural irrigation purposes are not available to the\ncommission, such legal entitlement shall be measured by the maximum number of\nacres under irrigation by the water user at any time during the year ending\n\nMarch 31, 1971, allowing one acre-foot of surface water annually per acre\nirrigated. (d) Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of subdivisions (a)-(c) of this section, there shall be no charge\nfor water made available from storage where: (1)\nthe cost of the storage facility has or\nwill be otherwise paid for by the user; (2)\nsuch storage controls a drainage area; and\n(3)\nthe use does not exceed the\nyield of such storage without augmentation from other surface water of the\nbasin.
