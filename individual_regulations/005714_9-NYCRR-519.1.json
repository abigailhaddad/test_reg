  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 519.1 - Applicable policies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The administration of non-judicial punishment in the State military\nforces shall be governed by section\n130.15\nof the Military Law of the State of\n\nNew York, by the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984 and AR 27-10\ndated 25 September 1986, as amended, except insofar as the provisions of the\n\nManual for Courts-Martial and AR 27-10 may be inconsistent with the State Code\nor inconsistent with or modified by this Part and Part V, NY Manual for\n\nCourts-Martial. Any inconsistency with this Part and any of the above cited\nreferences shall be resolved in favor of this Part and Part V, NYMCM. (b) Use of non-judicial punishment. (1)\nA commander should use nonpunitive\nmeasures to the fullest extent to further the efficiency of the command before\nresorting to non-judicial punishment. Use of non-judicial punishment is proper\nin all cases involving minor offenses in which nonpunitive measures are\nconsidered inadequate or inappropriate. If it is clear that non-judicial\npunishment will not be sufficient to meet the ends of justice, more stringent\nmeasures must be taken. Prompt action is essential for non-judicial punishment\nto have the proper corrective effect. Non-judicial punishment may be imposed\nto: (i) correct, educate and reform offenders\nwho the imposing commander determines cannot benefit from less stringent\nmeasures; (ii)\npreserve a member's\nrecord of service from unnecessary stigma by a record of court-martial\nconviction; and\n(iii)\nfurther\nmilitary efficiency by disposing of minor offenses in a manner requiring less\ntime and personnel than trial by court-martial. (c) Relationship of non-judicial punishment\nto nonpunitive measures. (1)\n\nGeneral. Non-judicial punishment is imposed to correct misconduct in violation of the\n\nState Code of Military Justice. Such conduct may result from intentional\ndisregard of or failure to comply with prescribed standards of military\nconduct. Non-punitive measures usually deal with misconduct resulting from\nsimple neglect, forgetfulness, laziness, inattention to instructions, sloppy\nhabits, immaturity, difficulty in adjusting to disciplined military life and\nsimilar deficiencies. These measures are primarily tools for teaching proper\nstandards of conduct and performance and do not constitute\npunishment. (2)\n\nIncluded among\nnonpunitive measures are denial of pass or other privileges, counseling, administrative reduction in grade, administrative reprimands and admonitions, extra training, bar to reenlistment, and MOS reclassification. Certain\ncommanders may administratively reduce enlisted personnel for inefficiency and\nother reasons. This authority exists apart from any authority to punish\nmisconduct under Military Law, section\n130.15. These two separate and distinct\nkinds of authority must not be confused (AR 600-200). (3)\n\nReprimands and admonitions. (i) Commanding Officers have authority to\ngive admonitions or reprimands either as an administrative measure or as\nnon-judicial punishment. If imposed as a punitive measure under section\n130.15\nthe procedure set forth in section\n519.3\nof this Part\nmust be followed. (ii)\nA written\nadministrative admonition or reprimand will contain a statement that it has\nbeen imposed as an administrative measure and not a punishment under section\n130.15\n(AR 600-37). Admonitions and reprimands imposed as punishment under\nsection\n130.15, whether administered orally or in writing (para 5c(1), Part V, MCM), should state clearly that they were imposed as punishment under that\nsection. (4)\n\nExtra\ntraining or instruction. One of the most effective nonpunitive measures\navailable to a commander is extra training or instruction (AR 600- 200). It is\nused when a member's duty performance has been substandard or deficient; e.g., a member who fails to maintain proper attire may be required to attend classes\non the wearing of the uniform and stand inspection until the deficiency is\ncorrected. The training or instruction should relate directly to the deficiency\nobserved and should be oriented to correct that particular deficiency. Extra\ntraining or instruction may be conducted after duty hours. (5)\n\nAdministrative reductions. These\nreductions may be made at the member's request to avoid adverse action. If\ntaken to avoid such adverse action, reductions will state that the action was\ntaken \"with prejudice\". (See para 6- 33, AR 600-200). (d) Personal exercise of discretion. A\ncommander who is considering a case for possible disposition under section\n130.15\nwill personally exercise discretion in: (1)\nevaluating the case to determine whether\nnon-judicial punishment should be imposed; (2)\ndetermining the amount and nature of any\npunishment, if punishment is appropriate.
