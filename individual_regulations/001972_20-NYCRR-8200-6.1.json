  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8200-6.1 - Computation of tentative railroad ceiling\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In any assessing unit other than an\nassessing unit which is expected to complete a reassessment, the tentative\nrailroad ceiling shall be computed as follows: (1)\n\nThe local reproduction cost of the\nrailroad real property is computed at the valuation date that applies to the\ncurrent roll, as set forth in sections\n489-e\nand\n489-ee\nof the Real Property\n\nTax Law. (2)\n\nTaxable full value\nequals the local reproduction cost, determined in accordance with paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision, multiplied by the applicable economic factor determined\npursuant to either section 489-e or 489-ee of the Real Property Taw Law, as the\ncase may be. (3)\n\nThe equalized\nvalue of the railroad real property is determined by multiplying the taxable\nfull value of the railroad real property, as determined in accordance with\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, by the final State equalization rate for the\nprior year's final assessment roll; provided, however, that if the final\nequalization rate for that roll has not been established at the time the\ntentative railroad ceiling assessment is to be determined, the tentative\nequalization rate for that roll shall be used in lieu thereof. (4)\n\nThe tentative railroad ceiling equals the\nequalized value of the railroad real property as determined in accordance with\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision adjusted pursuant to section\n489-w\nof Real Property Tax Law. (b) In an assessing unit which is\nexpected to complete a reassessment, the tentative railroad ceiling shall be\ncomputed as follows: (1)\n\nThe taxable full\nvalue of the railroad real property is computed at the valuation date that\napplies to the current roll, as set forth in sections\n489-e\nand\n489-ee\nof the\n\nReal Property Tax Law. (2)\n\nThe\ntentative railroad ceiling equals the taxable full value of the railroad\nproperty adjusted pursuant to section\n489-w\nof the Real Property Tax\n\nLaw. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n8200-6.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
