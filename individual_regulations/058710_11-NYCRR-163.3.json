  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 163.3 - Rules and standards governing changes in rating factors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An insurer may adjust its rating factors as part of a file and use change. The insurer shall incorporate the rate impact of these adjustments in the overall average rate change. These changes shall be consistent with the rate change limitations for individual insureds contained in section\n163.4\nof this Part. (b) An insurer may adjust its rating factors in separate and distinct filings independent of an overall average rate change. If these filings have no overall average rate impact, then the insurer may implement them on a file and use basis and the insurer shall not be precluded from implementing a file and use change for an overall average rate increase within the time periods specified in section\n163.2\n(b) of this Part. For example, the introduction of a physical damage coverage's model year rating factor for a new model year that is consistent with an existing model year rating rule is not subject to prior approval. These filings shall be consistent with the rate change limitations for individual insureds contained in section\n163.4\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n163.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
