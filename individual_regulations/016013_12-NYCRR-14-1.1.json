  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-1.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Alteration\nmeans a change in a boiler that substantially alters the original design and\nthat requires consideration of the effect of the change on the original design. Alteration does not include the addition to a boiler of nozzles smaller than an\nunreinforced opening size. (b) Approved means, in respect to a device or material: in compliance with a\nsubsisting resolution of approval adopted by the Commissioner; in respect to\naction by the commissioner: made the subject of a resolution of\napproval. (c) ASME Code means the\nboiler and pressure vessel code published by the American Society of Mechanical\n\nEngineers. (d) Boiler means a\nclosed vessel in which water is heated, steam is generated, steam is\nsuperheated, or any combination thereof, under pressure or vacuum for use\nexternally to itself by the application of heat from combustible fuels, electricity, or any other source, but shall not include a device or apparatus\nused solely to heat water for a hot water supply system. The term boiler shall\ninclude the apparatus used by which heat is generated, and all controls and\ndevices related to such apparatus or to the closed vessel. The term boiler also\nshall include fired units for heating or vaporizing liquids other than water\nwhere these units are separate from processing systems and are complete within\nthemselves. (e) Boiler external\npiping means piping within the scope of ASME Code section I and which requires\nASME Code stamping as specified in section I and this Code. (f) Certificate of competence means a\ncertificate issued to a boiler inspector by the department. (g) Commissioner means the Commissioner of\n\nLabor of the State of New York. (h) Component means a constituent part of a boiler assembly. (i) Condemned, with reference to a boiler, means declared to be unsafe and having an applied stamping designating its\ncondemnation. (j) Defect means a\ncondition which may directly or indirectly cause a boiler to be or become a\nsource of danger to any person by reason of fire, explosion, leakage, electricity or ionizing radiation. (k) Defective boiler means one which as an\nassembly includes a defect, or a boiler which is not provided with all required\ncontrols and devices in good operating condition. (l) Department means the Department of\n\nLabor. (m) External inspection\nmeans an inspection made while the boiler is in operation. (n) Fusion welding means the melting together\nof filler metal and base metal, or of base metal only, which results in\ncoalescence. (o) High temperature\nwater boiler means a boiler completely filled with water intended for operation\nat pressures in excess of 160 psi or temperatures in excess of 250°\nFahrenheit. (p) Hot water heating\nboiler means a boiler in which no steam is generated, from which hot water is\ncirculated for heating purposes and then returned to the boiler, and which\noperates at a pressure not exceeding 160 psi or a temperature of 250°\nFahrenheit at or near the boiler outlet. (q) Hot water supply boiler means a boiler\ncompletely filled with water that furnishes hot water to be used externally to\nitself at pressures not exceeding 160 psi at temperatures not exceeding\n250° Fahrenheit at or near the boiler outlet. (r) Incompetence means conduct which\nevidences a lack of ability to discharge a duty required to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, lack of knowledge of the fundamental\nprinciples of inspection services or an inability to apply those principles, or\nfailure to maintain competency in the current practices and methods applicable\nto inspection services and the rules of New York State. (s) Inspector means a boiler inspector who\nholds a valid certificate of competency issued by the department. (t) Installed means, in respect to a heating\nsystem boiler as a vessel, placed in a fixed operating location and connected\nto the heat distributing system; in respect to an unfired pressure vessel, placed in a fixed operating location. The term does not include a reassembly\nnot involving a change of location. (u) Insurance company means a company which\nhas been licensed in this State to write boiler insurance and which is actively\nengaged in writing such insurance for the general public. (v) Internal inspection means an inspection\nmade when the boiler is shut down and handholes and manholes or other\ninspection openings are opened or removed for inspection of the interior as\nrequired by the inspector. (w) Low\npressure boiler means a steam boiler on which the safety valves are set at\npressures not exceeding 15 psi. (x) Maximum allowable working pressure means the maximum gage pressure permissible\nat the top of a completed vessel in its operating position for a designated\ntemperature. (y) Maximum allowable\nworking temperature means the maximum temperature at or near the outlet of a\nhot water boiler, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, at which the boiler may be\nsafely operated. (z) Miniature\nboiler means a power boiler or high temperature water boiler which does not\nexceed any of the following limits: (1)\n16\ninches inside diameter of shell; (2)\n20 square feet of heating surface, except\nfor electric boilers; (3)\n5 cubic\nfeet gross volume exclusive of casing and insulation; and\n(4)\n100 psi maximum allowable working\npressure. (aa)\n\nNational\n\nBoard means the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors, Columbus, Ohio. (bb)\n\nOwner means\nthe owner or a lessee of a boiler or unfired pressure vessel. (cc)\n\nPortable boiler means an internally\nfired boiler primarily intended for temporary location and whose construction\nand usage is of a movable nature. (dd)\n\nPost-1917 installations means\ninstallations made on or after January 1, 1918. (ee)\n\nPower boiler means a boiler in which\nsteam or other vapor is generated at a pressure of more than 15 psi. (ff)\n\nPre-1918 installations means\ninstallations made before January 1, 1918. (gg)\n\nRelief valve means an automatic pressure\nrelieving device actuated by the static pressure upstream of the valve which\nopens further with the increase in pressure over the opening pressure. Note: A\nrelief valve is used primarily for liquid service. (hh)\n\nRepair means work necessary to restore a\nboiler to a safe operating condition. (ii)\n\nSafety relief valve means an automatic\npressure actuated relieving device suitable for use as either a safety valve or\na relief valve, depending upon application. (jj)\n\nSafety valve means an automatic pressure\nrelieving device actuated by the static pressure upstream of the valve and\ncharacterized by full-opening pop action. Note: A safety valve is used for gas\nor vapor service. (kk)\n\nSecondhand\nvessel means a boiler or unfired pressure vessel that has changed location\nsubsequent to the original installation. (ll)\n\nStandard means, with reference to a\nboiler or unfired pressure vessel, constructed and stamped in accordance with\nthe ASME Code. (mm)\n\nUnfired\npressure vessel means a container for the containment of internal or external\npressure which may be obtained from an external source or by the application of\nheat from a direct or indirect source, or any combination thereof, but\nexcluding: (1)\na pressure vessel meeting the\nrequirements of the United States department of transportation for the shipment\nof liquids or gases under pressure; (2)\nan air tank used on a vehicle used for\ncarrying passengers or freight or used directly in the operation of\ntrains; (3)\na pressure vessel\nhaving a volume of five cubic feet or less or having an inside diameter not\nexceeding six inches; (4)\na\npressure vessel designed for pressures of less than 15 psi; (5)\na hot water supply storage tank, provided\nnone of the following limitations is exceeded: (i) a heat input of 200,000 BTU's per\nhour; (ii)\na water temperature of\n210° Fahrenheit; or\n(iii)\na\nnominal water containing capacity of 120 gallons; (6)\na pressure vessel under Federal control\nor regulation; (7)\na pressure\nvessel containing water under pressure, including one containing air, the\ncompression of which serves only as a cushion, provided neither of the\nfollowing limitations is exceeded: (i) a\ndesign pressure of 300 psi; (ii)\na\ndesign temperature of 210° Fahrenheit; and\n(8)\na pressure vessel used for agricultural\npurposes.
