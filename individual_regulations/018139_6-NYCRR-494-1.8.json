(2)\n\nForce Majeure Event. The Applicant cannot\ncomply with the regulatory requirements, and the Applicant can demonstrate the\ntwo (2) following criteria: (i) noncompliance\nis due to a Force Majeure Event; and\n(ii)\nthe Applicant has used best efforts to\nanticipate and address any Force Majeure Event and any potential noncompliance, including minimizing any adverse effects of the greenhouse gas emissions\nrelated to noncompliance or making all efforts to repair all identified leaks\nand to operate and maintain equipment in accordance with manufacturer\nrecommendations, where applicable. (3)\n\nEconomic Hardship. The Applicant cannot\ncomply with the regulatory requirements, and the Applicant can demonstrate the\ntwo (2) following criteria: (i) The regulated\nequipment or facility is located in a Disadvantaged Community as defined in\nsection 4941.3 of this Part and is either a retail food facility or meets the\ndefinition of small business as defined in section\n131\nof\nthe Economic Development Law. (ii)\n\nCompliance would result in closure of the entire facility or a large portion of\nthe facility, or a substantial loss of revenue from the facility. (c) Application for\n\nVariance.

(5)\n\nExplanation and\ndescription of the reasons for seeking a variance. (6)\n\nIdentification of whether the variance\nrequested is pursuant to paragraphs 494-1.8(b)(1) or (2) or (3) of this\nsection, clear and convincing evidence demonstrating how the variance criteria\nspecified in subdivision 494-1.8(b) has been met and supporting documentation\nfor attributing noncompliance to the type of variance requested.

(8)\n\nLength of variance\nrequested as well as the earliest date when compliance will be\nachieved.

(ii)\n\nMilestone\nachievements and dates. (iii)\n\nFor\nvariance requests based on impossibility, quantification of GHG emissions\nresulting from normal business-as-usual operations as it directly relates to\nthe continued use of any regulated substance in sectors listed in section\n494-1.4 of this Part. This includes quantification of the direct emissions of\nregulated substances resulting from the manufacture, use, and disposal of\nequipment and products in New York State with all calculations, based on the\naverage lifetime of the equipment or product that will continue to use\nprohibited substances. Applicant must include all calculations used to\ncalculate GHG emissions estimates, including emission factors (e.g., refrigerant charge capacity and leak rate as defined in section 494-1.3 of this\n\nPart, and regulated substances used over the average lifetime of the equipment, system, or product). (iv)\n\nDescription of any negative impacts to human health or the environment that may\nresult from the granting of a variance. (v) A mitigation plan that demonstrates how\nthe Applicant will reduce excess emissions of regulated substances to a level\nequal to or below what would have been emitted had the Applicant complied and\nhow the Applicant will mitigate any negative impacts to human health or the\nenvironment. For variance requests based on impossibility, the Applicant must\ninclude all calculations used to calculate emissions estimates, including\nemission factors. These calculations may include refrigerant charge capacity\nand leak rate as defined in section 494-1.3 of this Part and regulated\nsubstances used over the average lifetime of the equipment, system, or product. The mitigation plan may include actions such as to minimize usage of regulated\nsubstances, efforts to reduce leaks or venting of regulated substances, or\nactions to recycle or destroy high-GWP refrigerant(s).

(2)\n\nThe variance shall cease to be effective\nimmediately upon the failure of the Applicant, to whom the variance was\ngranted, to comply with any term or condition of the approved\nvariance.
