Tit. 1 § 159.12 - Disposal or remediation of non-compliant hemp\n\nState Regulations\n\nCommercial lots shall be subject to disposal or remediation\nwhen a sample tests over the acceptable hemp THC level based on regulatory\nsampling. (a) Disposal. (i) A grower shall dispose of and document\nthe disposal of non-compliant hemp within 5 days of the delivery of notice of\nregulatory testing results finding that a grower's hemp is\nnon-compliant. (ii)\n\nAll\nnon-compliant hemp shall be disposed of by one of the following methods: (1)\n\nDisposal off site by using a\nDEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement; or\n(2)\n\nDisposal on site at the farm or hemp\nproduction facility using the following methods: plowing under non-complaint\nplants, composting into \"green manure\" for use on the same land, tilling, discing, burial or burning or other disposal methods, approved by the\n\nDepartment, and which make the product unusable, non-consumable, non-retrievable and unmarketable. (iii)\n\nOn site disposal requires that the crop\ndestruction be verified through the use of one of the following methods, which\nshall be approved by the Department in writing, prior to such disposal: inperson verification by a Department inspector, the taking of pictures, videos, or other proof of disposal, with the prior written approval of the\n\nDepartment. (iv)\n\nIf the grower\nrequests re-testing at its own expense, the grower shall dispose of and\ndocument the disposal of the non-compliant hemp within 5 days of the delivery\nof the notice of a final determination that the hemp is\nnon-compliant. (b) Remediation. (i) A commercial grower with\nnon-compliant hemp may remediate the non-compliant crop by either: (1)\ndisposing of flower materials and\nsalvaging the remainder of the plant; or\n(2)\nblending the entire plant into plant\nmaterial biomass by chopping or shredding all flowers, buds, trichomes, leaves, stalks, seed, and all plant parts from the non-compliant sampled lot in such a\nway to create a homogeneous and uniform blend of all plant material of that\nlot. (ii)\n\nAll remediated\nplant material shall be sampled by the Department or a Department approved\nsampling agent and tested for the material's THC levels at the grower's\nexpense. (iii)\n\nRemediated biomass\nshall be separated from any compliant hemp stored in the area and clearly\nlabeled and demarcated as \"hemp for remediation purposes.\" All lots subject to\nremediation shall be stored, labeled, and demarcated apart from each other and\nfrom other compliant hemp lots stored or held nearby. Remediated biomass shall\nnot leave the labeled and demarcated area until a test result showing\ncompliance with the acceptable hemp THC level is received or until the biomass\nis destroyed. (iv)\n\nOnly\nsuccessfully remediated plant material may enter the stream of commerce and any\nnon-compliant hemp shall be destroyed as set forth above. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
