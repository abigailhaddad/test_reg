  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 550.2 - Classification of waters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) There\nare two classes of waters within the Interstate Environmental District: class A\nand class B. Each class is divided into subclasses. The requirements of section\n550.1\nof this Part shall apply to\nall waters within the Interstate Environmental District. In addition, each\nsubclass of the waters shall meet the requirements and be available for the\nuses as provided for that subclass. (b) It is the underlying principle of these\nregulations that each class and subclass of waters within the Interstate\n\nEnvironmental District is to be suitable for its best intended uses and that\nall waters are to be protected, maintained, and improved to the end that they\nwill afford as satisfactory conditions as possible for the maintenance and\nrestoration of the natural ecosystems. It is also recognized that different\nclassifications of waters are appropriate for different areas because of\nvarying activities such as are associated with industry, commerce (including\nwaterborne transportation), recreation, and aesthetic enjoyment. All waters\nshould be aesthetic assets and should, at a minimum, be available for those\nrecreational uses which do not bring the human body into direct contact with\nthe water. (c) (1)\n\nStreams and other waterbodies shall have\na minimum dissolved oxygen content in accordance with their respective\nclassifications as follows: (i) A: Dissolved\n\nOxygen: 5 milligrams per liter; (ii)\nB-1: Dissolved Oxygen: 4 milligrams per\nliter; (iii)\nB-2: Dissolved Oxygen: 3 milligrams per liter. (2)\n\nIn addition to meeting the requirements\nset forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, waters shall in all respects be\nsuitable for their best intended uses as follows: (i) A: Suitable for all forms of primary and\nsecondary contact recreation and for fish propagation. In designated areas, they also shall be suitable for shellfish harvesting. (ii)\nB-1: Suitable for fishing and secondary\ncontact recreation. They shall be suitable for the growth and maintenance of\nfish life and other forms of marine life naturally occurring therein, but may\nnot be suitable for fish propagation. (iii)\nB-2: Suitable for passage of anadromous\nfish and for the maintenance of fish life in a manner consistent with the\ncriteria established in section\n550.1\n(a)-(b)\nof\nthis Part. (d) As used in this Part: (1)\n\nPrimary contact\nrecreation means recreational activity that involves significant ingestion\nrisk, including but not limited to wading, swimming, diving, surfing and water\nskiing. (2)\n\nSecondary contact\nrecreation means recreational activity in which the probability of significant\ncontact with the water or water ingestion is minimal, including but not limited\nto boating, fishing, and shoreline recreational activity involving limited\ncontact with surface waters. (e) Effluents discharged or flowing into\nwaters of any class shall meet the requirements provided in this Part. The\neffluent limitation values contained in paragraph (2) of this subdivision are\ngeometric means, and in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subdivision are\narithmetic means. Industrial effluent limitation values are for process water\nvolume. Any contaminants taken into the discharger's plant or process from the\nwaters of the Interstate Environmental District shall not be charged against\nthe effluent quality in computing the values for compliance with these\nregulations. (1)\npH within the range from 6.0\nto 9.0 may be required if the receiving waters are outside this\nrange. (2)\n\nFecal coliform content\nshall not exceed 200 per 100 ml on a 30-consecutive-day average; 400 per 100 ml\non a 7-consecutive-day average; and 800 per 100 ml on a 6-consecutive-hour\naverage, but no sample may contain more than 2,400 per 100 ml. The only portion\nof the Interstate Environmental District to which this provision shall not\napply at all times is that referred to in section\n550.3\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Part. For the aforementioned portion of the district, these disinfection\nrequirements shall apply when disinfection is required to protect the best\nintended uses of the waters in question. For example, in the case of discharge\ninto waters used primarily for bathing, this bacterial standard need not be\nrequired except during the bathing season. (3)\n\nBiochemical oxygen demand shall not\nexceed 30 mg/l on a 30-consecutive-day average, 45 mg/l on a 7-consecutive-day\naverage, and 50 mg/l on a 6- consecutive-hour average. Further, all sewage or\nother polluting matter discharged or permitted to flow into waters of the\ndistrict shall first have been so treated as to effect a reduction in the\noxygen demand of the effluent sufficient to maintain the dissolved oxygen\ncontent in the waters of the district, and in the general vicinity of the point\nof discharge of the sewage or other polluting matter into those waters, at a\ndepth of about five feet below the surface, of not less than the dissolved\noxygen concentration set forth in subdivision (c) of this section. (4)\n\nTotal suspended solids content shall not\nexceed 30 mg/l on a 30- consecutive-day average, 45 mg/l on a 7-consecutive-day\naverage, and 50 mg/l on a 6-consecutive-hour average. (5)\n\nEffluents shall contain no floating\nsolids. (6)\n\nAll wastes shall be of\na character that will not violate or cause violation of the requirements\ncontained in section\n550.1\nof this Part. (7)\n\nAn effluent discharge which does not\nsatisfy the requirements of the commission shall not be considered to be in\nviolation thereof if caused by temporary excess flows due to storm water\nconveyed to treatment plants through combined sewer systems, provided that the\ndischarger is operating the facility with reasonable care, maintenance and\nefficiency, and has acted and continues to act with due diligence and speed to\ncorrect the condition resulting from the storm water flow. (f) Unless there has been rainfall in greater\nthan trace amounts or significant melting of frozen precipitation during the\nimmediately preceding 24 hours, no discharges to the waters of the Interstate\n\nEnvironmental District shall occur from combined sewer regulating\ndevices.
