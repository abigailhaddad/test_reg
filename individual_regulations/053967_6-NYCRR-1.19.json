  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 1.19 - Deer management permit quotas, group sizes, and legal harvest\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Legal harvest. Only deer without antlers or having antlers measuring\nless than three inches in length, except as provided in section\n1.20\n(k) of this\n\nPart, may be taken on a deer management permit (DMP). (b) Number of DMPs available to an\nindividual. A person may apply for and be a permittee on not more\nthan two DMPs during the initial application period, as described in section\n1.20\n(b)(2)\nof this\n\nPart, except that in wildlife management units (WMUs) where the number of\nhunters is inadequate to achieve needed harvest, the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation (department) may provide for the issuances of\nadditional permits to an individual or group. WMUs are defined in section\n4.1\nof this Title. Subsequent\napplication periods, as described in section\n1.20\n(e) of this\n\nPart, may be conducted for DMPs in WMUs where insufficient numbers of\napplicants exist to achieve adequate deer harvest. A person may apply for and\nbe a permittee on no more than two additional DMPs during all subsequent\napplication periods, except in WMUs where the department has elected to issue\nbonus permits. (c) Number of DMPs issued for each WMU. The number of permits required to achieve optimal deer\nharvest will be calculated using the following WMU specific variables: the\nexpected buck take, the desired adult female take, the proportion of adult\nfemales in the anticipated harvest, DMP harvest, DMP success rate and the\ndesired population objective. The actual number of permits issued may vary\nslightly from the optimal number of permits due to the nature of the DMP\nissuance described in section\n1.20\nof this Part. (d) Group sizes. Deer hunting groups must be formed by the hunters\nthemselves. (1)\n\nFor all other than\nlandowner/disabled veteran DMPs, the size of the hunting group will be one\nhunter in all WMUs. (2)\n(i) For landowner DMPs, the size of the\nhunting group shall be a minimum of one and a maximum of two hunters in all\nWMUs. (ii)\n\nFor disabled veteran\nDMPs, the size of the hunting group will be one hunter in all WMUs. (3)\n\nFor second DMPs, when\navailable, the group size shall be the same as the group size required for the\nunit selected for an applicant's first permit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n1.19\n\nAmended, New\n\nYork State Register August 27, 2014/Volume XXXVI, Issue 34, eff. 8/27/2014\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
