Additional analyses may be\nrequired, as determined by the department; (iii)\nthe volume of waste land-applied does\nnot cause ponding, except for temporary conditions within 12 hours of\napplication; (iv)\nthe application\nrate of waste does not exceed the agronomic rate, a chloride loading of 170\npounds per acre per year, or results in an organic matter content above eight\npercent in the plow layer, whichever is more restrictive; (v) the waste is beneficial to the crop grown\nand does not contain any human sanitary waste (e.g., domestic sewage, biosolids, septage) or it is demonstrated that pathogen content is below\ndetectable levels in the waste; (vi)\nfor papermill residuals, the residuals are 20\npercent solids or greater and must not contain secondary treatment (biological)\nresiduals; (vii)\nthe facility\nsubmits an odor management plan to the department prior to land application and\nimplements the plan when needed; (viii)\nland application in the New York City\nwater supply watershed or in Nassau or Suffolk county is addressed in a CNMP; and\n(ix)\nthe temporary field\nstorage of papermill residuals and dry food processing waste prior to land\napplication is allowed, provided the following criteria are met: (a) the storage period is a maximum of 30\ndays or six months if under covered storage; (b) unless stored under covered storage, the\nresiduals are stored on the field where they will be applied, and the amount\nstored does not exceed the amount that will be land applied on the\nsite; (c) the storage area must not\nbe located on areas with a slope greater than three percent; (d) the residuals must have sufficient solids\ncontent that they will retain their shape if stacked three feet high and must\nbe formed so that precipitation is shed from the pile; (e) any run-off from the stockpile must be\ncontained within the land application site; and\n(f) after removal of the residuals, the\nstorage area must be reseeded or returned to active cropland. (4)\nA land application\nfacility for septage from a transporter using no more than two vehicles at any\none time for collection related to land application, or for the residuals from\na composting toilet (liquid and solids) or source separated urine, provided the\nfollowing conditions are satisfied: (i) the\noperating requirements of section\n361-2.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart are met, except section\n361-2.5\n(b)(4) and\n(12)\nof this Subpart; (ii)\nprior to land application, septage is\nscreened to remove visible nondegradable debris such as plastics, etc., and the\nlarger nondegradable debris is disposed in a landfill or by other means\napproved by the department; (iii)\nat least 15 acres are available for each vehicle, except for composting toilet\nresiduals; (iv)\nvegetation is grown\nat the application site that is sufficient to use all the available nitrogen\nprovided from waste application; (v) the liquid septage application rate does\nnot exceed 25,000 gallons per acre per year, or the rate determined by the\nfollowing calculation, whichever is less. Application Rate (gallons/acre/year)\n= Crop nitrogen needs (pounds nitrogen/acre) x 385 The department can alter the\nallowed application rate if the septage is dewatered or is otherwise different\nthan a typical septage; (vi)\nthe\napplication rate for the composting toilet residuals does not exceed the\nagronomic rate; (vii)\nfor pathogen\nreduction, the pH of the waste is raised to 12 or higher by alkali addition and\nremains at 12 or higher for 30 minutes or analyses demonstrate an equivalent or\ngreater level of pathogen reduction has been achieved. In addition, the\nfollowing restrictions must be followed: (a) public access must be restricted during land application and for at least one\nyear after land application by the posting of signs, or the use of fences, gates or other department-approved means of preventing access; (b) food crops with harvested parts that\ntouch the soil and are totally above the land surface must not be grown for 14\nmonths after land application. Food crops with harvested parts below the\nsurface of the land must not be grown for 38 months after land\napplication; (c) feed crops, fiber\ncrops, and food crops grown above the soil with harvested parts that do not\ntouch the soil must not be grown for at least 30 days after land\napplication; (d) animals must not\nbe grazed on the land for at least 30 days after land application; and\n(e) turf grown on land where\nwaste has been applied must not be grown for one year after land application\nwhen the harvested turf will be placed on either land with a high potential for\npublic exposure or a lawn.
