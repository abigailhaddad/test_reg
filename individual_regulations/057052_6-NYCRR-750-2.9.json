  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 750-2.9 - Additional conditions applicable to a publicly owned treatment works (POTW)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nIn addition to the\nrequirements set forth in this Subpart, all POTWs must provide adequate notice\nto the department of the following: (i) As set\nforth in department guidance on what is a substantial change in volume or\ncharacter of pollutants introduced into a POTW, any such change. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of this paragraph, adequate\nnotice shall include information on: (a) the\nquality and quantity of effluent introduced into the POTW; and\n(b) any anticipated impact of the change on\nthe quantity or quality of effluent to be discharged from the POTW. (2)\n\nIf the department\ndetermines, on the basis of a notice provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision and any related investigation, inspection or sampling, that a\nmodification of a permit is necessary to assure maintenance of water quality\nstandards and guidance values or compliance with other provisions of ECL\narticle 17, this Part, or the act, then the department may propose such a\nmodification. Unless the department determines that such permit modification is\nunnecessary, the noticed act is prohibited until the permit has been modified\npursuant to Part 621 of this Title. (3)\n\nThe permittee shall identify all inflow\nto the tributary system and remove excessive infiltration/inflow to an extent\nthat is economically feasible. (4)\n\nThe permittee shall enact, maintain and enforce or cause to be enacted, maintained and enforced up-to-date and effective Sewer Use Law in all parts of\nthe POTW service area. Such enactment and enforcement shall include\nintermunicipal agreements and/or other enforceable legal instruments that allow\nthe permittee to control discharges, either directly or through jurisdictions\ncontributing flows to the POTW, flow and loads to the POTW as well as\ndischarges to the POTW. (5)\n\nNew\nconnections to a publicly owned sewer system or a privatized municipal sewer\nsystem are prohibited when the permittee is notified by the department: (i) that the discharge(s) regulated by a\nSPDES permit create(s) or is likely to create a public health or potential\npublic health hazard, a contravention of water quality standards or guidance\nvalues or the impairment of the best use of waters, as determined by the\ncommissioner; or\n(ii)\nthat the\npermittee has failed or is likely to fail to carry out, meet or comply with any\nlimit or requirement of the permit, compliance schedule, order of the\ndepartment, judicial order, or consent decree. (6)\n\nThe provisions provided for in paragraph\n(5) of this subdivision shall remain in effect until the permittee can\ndemonstrate to the department's satisfaction and approval that adequate\navailable capacity exists in the plant and that the facility is in full\ncompliance with all of the effluent limitations required by the\npermit. (b) National pretreatment standards. (1)\n\nAll POTWs shall comply with the provisions contained in\n40 CFR\n403.5(a), (b), (c) and (d)\n(see section 750-1.25 of this Part). (2)\nEPA and State enforcement actions. If, within 30 days after notice of an interference or pass-through violation has\nbeen sent by EPA or the department to the POTW, and to persons or groups who\nhave requested such notice, the POTW fails to commence appropriate enforcement\naction to correct the violation, EPA and the department may take appropriate\nenforcement action. (3)\nPOTWs\nrequired by the department to develop a pretreatment program in accordance with\n40\nCFR\n403.8\nshall submit an approvable program\napplication in accordance with\n40\nCFR\n403.8\n(see section 750-1.25 of this\n\nPart). (4)\n\nThe approval authority, as defined by\n40\nCFR\n403.3\n(see section 750-1.25 of this\n\nPart), shall review, require changes to, approve and/or disapprove such a\nprogram in accordance with\n40\nCFR\n403.9\nand\n403.11\n(see section 750-1.25 of this Part). (5)\nPOTWs and industrial users shall submit\nreports as required in accordance with\n40 CFR\n403.12\n(see section 750-1.25 of this\n\nPart). (6)\n\nIndustrial users may\nobtain intake credits in accordance with\n40 CFR\n403.15\n(see section 750-1.25 of this\n\nPart). (7)\n\nModifications to\npretreatment programs shall be made in accordance with\n40 CFR\n403.18\n(see section 750-1.27 of this\n\nPart). (c) POTW\ndesign, planning and flow management. (1)\n\nFlow management plan. (i) Within 120 days of when the permittee\ndetermines in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subdivision that the annual\naverage flow value for a calendar year to a POTW has reached or exceeded 95\npercent of that POTWs design flow, the permittee shall submit to the regional\nwater engineer a flow management plan to identify and implement reductions in\nhydraulic loading to the POTW treatment plant or failing that, approvable\nengineering reports, plans and specifications and/or capital improvements as\nnecessary to stabilize annual average flows below the POTW treatment plant\ndesign flow. This plan shall be certified by a professional engineer licensed\nto practice in the State of New York and endorsed by the chief fiscal officer\nof the municipality. The provisions of the plan may reflect new efforts or may\nrefer to existing, ongoing efforts. The flow management plan shall, at a\nminimum, include provisions for: (a) a\nstatement to the effect that the permittee has the authority in all parts of\nthe POTW service area to implement or cause to be implemented the provisions of\nthis subdivision or, if the permittee does not have such authority, a proposed\nschedule, not to exceed three years, to obtain such authority or a statement\nfrom the permittee's designated legal representative that existing law\nprecludes the permittee from obtaining such authority; (b) an inventory of all known\nfacilities/projects that have applied to connect to the sewer system and a\ndetermination if there is capacity for connection; (c) a schedule of implementation for all flow\nreduction measures identified herein; (d) a map delineating the service area as\ndefined; and\n(e) a description of\ninformation that will be reported during implementation of the plan to the\nregional water engineer and a schedule for such reporting. (ii)\n\nThe flow management plan required by\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall also include provisions for\nimplementation of any or all of the following that are necessary to stabilize\ninfluent flows below design flows: (a) water\nconservation measures to reduce customer usage by measures including but not\nlimited to customer metering, meter calibration, retrofitting existing plumbing\nfixtures with water conservation fixtures and revision of water rate\nstructures; (b) reduction of\ninfiltration and inflow through continuous measures including but not limited\nto sewer system metering, evaluation and rehabilitation, removal of roof\nleaders and footing drains from separate sanitary sewers and installation of\nseparate storm sewers; (c) prevention of future sources of infiltration and inflow where feasible through\nmeasures including but not limited to implementation of standards for sewer\ninstallation and requirements to provide for adequate drainage from roof\nleaders and footing drains in new construction; (d) measures to maximize sewer system and\nsewage treatment works capacity at a minimum cost; (e) approvable engineering reports and/or\nplans and specifications to assure annual average flows do not exceed 95\npercent of the POTW treatment plant design flow; and/or\n(f) capital improvements necessary to assure\nannual average flows do not exceed 95 percent of the POTW treatment plant\ndesign flow. (iii)\n\nWithin 90 days of submittal to the regional water engineer of the plan required\nunder subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, the permittee shall begin\nto implement the provisions of said program in accordance with the proposed\nschedule or cause the provisions of said program to be implemented by another\nparty. (iv)\n\nThe regional water\nengineer may object to the plan, or implementation of the plan, submitted in\naccordance with subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph if the plan does\nnot provide for substantive and effective measures to reduce hydraulic loading\nto the POTW. Within 90 days of receipt of written notification from the\nregional water engineer documenting the aspects of the plan that must be\nrevised, the permittee shall submit a revised plan that addresses the\ndepartment's objection(s). (2)\n\nPlanning. (i) Within 120 days of when the permittee\ndetermines that the actual influent mass loading of biochemical oxygen demand\nor total suspended solids to a POTW has reached or exceeded the design influent\nloading for those parameters for any eight calendar months during a calendar\nyear, the permittee shall submit a plan for future growth at the POTW. The plan\nshall include: (a) provisions for obtaining\nany necessary funding; (b) provisions for preparation and submission to the regional water engineer of\napprovable engineering reports and/or plans and specifications to provide for\ngrowth of discharges in the POTW service area; and\n(c) a demonstration of the permittee's\nability to impose a connection moratorium in any and all parts of the service\narea or, if the permittee does not have such authority, a proposed schedule, not to exceed three years, to obtain such authority or a statement from the\npermittee's designated legal representative that existing law precludes the\npermittee from obtaining such authority. (ii)\n\nThe regional water engineer may object\nto the plan, or implementation of the plan, submitted in accordance with\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph if the plan does not provide for substantive\nand effective measures to accommodate future growth of discharges from the POTW\nservice area. Within 90 days of receipt of written notification from the\nregional water engineer documenting the aspects of the plan that must be\nrevised, the permittee shall submit an approvable, revised plan that addresses\nthe department's objection(s). (iii)\n\nWithin 90 days of submittal to the\nregional water engineer of the plan required under subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, the permittee shall begin to implement the plan to obtain the\nauthority required under clause (i)(\nc\n) of this\nparagraph. (3)\n\nPlan\nimplementation and sewer connection moratorium. For POTWs that have exceeded\nthe design influent loading criteria set forth in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, within 90 days of when the permittee determines that, in\naccordance with the annual review required by paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision, that the effluent discharge from a publicly owned treatment works\nhas exceeded a SPDES permit limit for biochemical oxygen demand or ultimate\noxygen demand for any four or more months during two consecutive calendar\nquarters, or a SPDES permit limit for total suspended solids for any four or\nmore months during two consecutive calendar quarters, the permittee shall: (i) begin to implement the plan developed in\naccordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision or in accordance with this\nsubparagraph; and\n(ii)\ncease the\nfurther approval of sewer connections to the POTW. (4)\n\nAnnual certification. The chief fiscal\nofficer of any municipality subject to this subdivision shall certify in\nwriting to the department as an attachment to its February discharge monitoring\nreport that the municipality is complying with the provisions of this\nsubdivision and, if applicable, is complying with the implementation schedule\nin the program adopted in accordance with paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this\nsubdivision or if such compliance certification cannot be provided to the\ndepartment, satisfactory explanation for deviation from the provisions of this\nsubdivision must be provided. (5)\n\nRescission of plan requirements or moratoria. The regional water engineer may\nrescind or hold in abeyance any or all of the conditions imposed under this\nsubdivision provided the permittee can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the\ndepartment that: (i) the conditions were\nimplemented on the basis of erroneous data; or\n(ii)\nthe situation that gave rise to the\nimposition of the conditions has been adequately addressed; or\n(iii)\nthere is an existing or potential\npublic health nuisance or hazard as determined by the State Department of\n\nHealth, that is best remediated by rescinding or holding in abeyance the\nconditions; or\n(iv)\nall compliance\nconditions in a SPDES permit or a judicially or administratively imposed order\nhave been or will be met. (6)\n\nViolations of permit limits. Compliance\nwith this section does not, in any way, shield the permittee from enforcement\nactions for violations of SPDES permit limits. (7)\n\nThe regional water engineer may, by\nwritten approval, upon adequate demonstration of compelling need, allow for\nrelaxation of schedules contained in this subdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
