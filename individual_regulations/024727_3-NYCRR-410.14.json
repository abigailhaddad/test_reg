In the\nevent of the insolvency, liquidation or bankruptcy of the mortgage broker, or\nthe expiration, surrender or revocation of such mortgage broker's registration, or where the Superintendent takes possession of such registrant, the proceeds\nof the bond shall be paid to the Superintendent forthwith for disposition in\naccordance with the applicable provisions of the Banking Law.\"\n(c) Mortgage brokers that have\nbeen placed on inactive status pursuant to section\n410.17\nof this Part need not obtain\na surety bond or deposit of assets.
