(c) Additional job titles, job classifications (i.e., career ladder development) within each profession are developed by local and State civil service agencies. In no case may the qualifications for these titles and classifications be less than the minimum standards established by this Part for entry or first supervisory level positions.

(e) Any individual whose qualifications are disapproved by the local civil service agency or the State Commissioner of Health or County Commissioner or Public Health Director may request a review of such disapproval by the Public Health Council.
