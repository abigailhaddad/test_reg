  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 502.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nChapter 673 of the Laws of 1986, the Low-Level Radioactive\n\nWaste Management Act, provides that the New York State Energy Research and\n\nDevelopment Authority has responsibility for the construction and operation by\n1993 of facilities in New York for permanent disposal of low-level radioactive\nwaste generated within New York. The act establishes the Commission for Siting\n\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and empowers the commission to\nmake site and disposal method selections, sufficient to accommodate low-level\nradioactive waste generated in New York over at least 30 years. The act also\nprovides related responsibilities for the New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation (DEC) and New York State Department of Health (DOH). The act provides that the authority shall establish by regulation and collect\nrates, charges, and other fees upon the disposal of low-level radioactive waste\nsufficient to recover from generators costs of the State associated with\nlow-level radioactive waste management facilities, and authorizes the authority\nto establish terms and conditions for receipt, acceptance, and disposal of\nlow-level radioactive waste at the permanent disposal facilities. The act\nrequires the authority to submit annually to the Governor and the Legislature a\nreport summarizing low-level radioactive waste generated within New York during\nthe previous calendar year. In addition, the act requires each generator of\nlow-level radioactive waste within New York to submit to the authority no less\nfrequently than annually a report detailing low-level radioactive waste\ngenerated, stored for decay or later transfer, or transferred by the generator. The purpose of these rules is to set forth the requirements for reports to be\nsubmitted by generators to the authority. The purpose of the reporting\nrequirements is to assist the authority in constructing low- level radioactive\nwaste management facilities, establishing rates, charges, and other fees for\ndisposal of low-level radioactive waste, and terms and conditions for its\nreceipt, acceptance, and disposal at permanent disposal facilities, and\npreparing the reports to be submitted annually by the authority to the Governor\nand the Legislature. In addition, the reports are intended to provide\ninformation useful to the DEC, the Commission for Siting Low-Level Radioactive\n\nWaste Disposal Facilities, and the Advisory Committee on Permanent Disposal\n\nFacilities Siting and Disposal Method Selection in meeting their\nresponsibilities under the act.
