  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 13 § 17.2 - Contents of offering plan\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Cover. (1)\n\nThe lower portion of the outside front cover of every offering plan shall contain the\nfollowing statement in capital letters printed in boldface roman type of at least 10-point modern type and at least two points leaded: THIS OFFERING PLAN IS THE SPONSOR's ENTIRE OFFER TO SELL THESE\nCOOPERATIVE APARTMENTS. NEW YORK LAW REQUIRES THE SPONSOR TO DISCLOSE ALL MATERIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COOPERATIVE APARTMENTS IN THIS PLAN AND\nTO FILE THIS PLAN WITH THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF LAW PRIOR TO SELLING OR OFFERING TO SELL ANY APARTMENT. FILING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LAW\nDOES NOT MEAN THAT THE DEPARTMENT OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY HAS APPROVED THIS OFFERING. (2)\n\nThere shall be set forth on the outside front cover page of every plan of cooperative organization the following information: (i) the amount of money to be raised if all apartments are sold; (ii)\nthe name and address of the cooperative corporation (which shall not be a general name for several co-ops, but the specific name of the corporation\nwhose stock is being offered); (iii)\nthe approximate date of the proposed first offer to the public. The\nterm of the initial offer is 12 months, commencing on the filing date indicated in the letter from the Department of Law; (iv)\na listing of the names and addresses of the actual promoters (whether they be builders, general contractors, landowners, etc.), which shall include dummy corporations only at the bottom of such listing (unless such listing is included on the face of the\nfirst inside leaf); and\n(v) the names and addresses of the selling agents. (3)\n\nOn the inside front cover, or the next immediate page, there shall be printed a table of contents. (b) Body of offering plan; informational content. (1)\n(i) If there is no undertaking contained in the offering plan by the offerors or others to return all moneys\ninvested in the offering in the event of the failure or discontinuance of the promotion, the following language shall be employed in the offering\nplan in italics: If insufficient funds are raised to complete this offering, or if the\noffering is not completed for any other reason, you may receive back only part of your investment, not your full investment. (ii)\n\nIf the promoters reserve the right to change the price of any apartment without substantial limitation, then\nsuch fact and the effects thereof shall be set forth within the plan and such fact must be included in easily readable, bold print on the front cover\nof the offering plan. And in such case, the front page statement shall be as follows: \"The prices for these apartments may be changed from time to time during\nthis offering, so that prior or subsequent purchasers may pay or may have paid less or more than present subscribers for similar apartments. The\neffect of such is set forth on page [indicate page].\"\n(iii)\n\nAnd above the price schedule, in such\ncase, there shall be the statement: \"See page [indicate page] for conditions applicable to these\nprices.\"\n(2)\n\nEach offering should contain a fair summary of material relevant to the\nparticular offering. Each offering plan should be viewed with respect to the special nature of that particular offering. The following factors, in\naddition to those facts and representations required by subdivision (1)(b) of section 352-e of the New York Real Estate Syndicate Act, should be\nconsidered with respect to every offering of cooperative apartments. However, the necessary addition of other factors shall depend on the nature of\nthe particular offering. Thus, for example, type of \"landfill\" should be included in developments on swamp or other marginal lands, or where existing\nbuildings in the area have been troubled by excessive settling, etc. (i) A description of the premises and locality, including but not limited to: (a) The surrounding neighborhood, growth and changing phases. The aforesaid shall\ninclude, for example, in new developments or in outlying areas: shopping facilities in actual existence; schools actually existing or under actual\nconstruction; transportation facilities in actual existence; the zoning of the immediate adjacent areas surrounding the existing building or the\nbuilding to be constructed. (b) With reference to any swimming pools which are not to be owned by the\ncooperative organization, but to which residents of the cooperative are to be given access under the terms of any proposed or existing agreement with\nthe builder, etc.: the size of the pool in existence or to be constructed; the type of construction; the name of the contractor who built or will\nbuild such pool; the proposed fee to be charged for the use thereof; residence restriction or priority on use of pool; and the date set forth for\nfinal completion and the availability of the finished pool. (ii)\n\nThe assessed valuation and\ntax rate for the past two years, also indicating the approximate date for each assessment; if new construction, the fact that the assessment is open\nfor determination by the government units involved, and will affect any projection now made of real estate taxes. (iii)\n\nAttached to and made a part of the plan of cooperative organization, there shall be a concise separate\nschedule of the description of the land, buildings, apartments and equipment to be owned by the cooperative corporation, which shall include detailed\ninformation concerning those factors pertinent to the particular type of offering. Examples of factors to be considered, where relevant are: type of\nlandfill; the general nature of structure (concrete, steel, etc.); exterior and interior walls and facing; floors and ceilings; bathrooms; painting\nand papering; roof; insulation and heating; windows and doors; kitchen equipment; patios, sun decks, terraces, etc.; hardware and lighting fixtures; ventilators and air conditioning; basement; water supply (including name of company servicing area); sanitary sewage system, plumbing and storm water\ndisposal; swimming pool, boat mooring and other recreational facilities (if such facilities are to be owned by cooperative organization, full\ninformation as to the size, type of construction, name of contractor and scheduled date of completion); TV antenna; landscaping; parking and\ngaraging; laundry facilities; public halls, stairways, entrances and exits; elevators; disposal facilities; service personnel and duties; storage\nspace per apartment and general storage facilities; special sources of income for the cooperative organization. Irrespective of above, where all or\nmost of the prospective purchasers have been in actual residence in the premises for several years (as in the case of rent-controlled conversions), emphasis should be on present condition of premises, including deficiencies probably unknown to occupants, rather than description of material\nmake-up visually obvious to each resident. (iv)\n\nDate of construction or scheduled completion of\nconstruction. (v) Date present owner acquired property. (vi)\n\nType of deed to be conveyed. (vii)\n\nThe financial details: the terms of all institutional and other\nfinancing, including rate of interest, method of amortization (and whether self-liquidating), amount of each mortgage, rights pertaining to\nprepayment, the names and addresses of all present and prospective holders of relevant mortgages and the status of all commitments, a description of\nany governmental mortgage, insurance or guaranty; the necessity for future refinancing of \"balloon-type\" mortgages, if applicable, and the concurrent\nproblem of additional assessments. (viii)\nA separate schedule including: identification of each\napartment; number of rooms and baths in each; the allocation of shares; the stock price per apartment; the estimated annual expense and maintenance\nper share, per apartment and per total of all apartments. (ix)\n\nMiscellaneous expenses incurred or to be\nincurred in effecting the offering, including a breakdown of selling commissions, realty brokerage fees, legal expenses, accounting fees, mortgage\nplacement and processing fees, advertising expenses, special payments to any person or firm for any services, counsel or other reason relating to the\noffering and not otherwise covered by this Part. Insofar as legal and accounting fees are concerned, the aforesaid relates only to amounts paid by\nthe cooperative corporation, which fees may be grouped together with other expenses, in a reasonable manner, where the individual fees are not paid\nto any of the promoters or firms associated with them. A \"promoter\" for this purpose is not meant to include members of any law firm merely used to\nfill cooperative corporation offices on a temporary basis. (x) The names of the recipients of the\nexpenditures set forth in the preceding subparagraph and the relationship, if any, directly or indirectly, to any of the promoters. (xi)\n\nThe approximate amount of any inspection fee to be paid to any government agency for physical inspection or\nappraisal of the property (FHA, NYS Retirement Fund, etc.). (xii)\nA breakdown of projected maintenance\n(including labor) charges, including: the projected totals for itemized expenses and the basis thereof (whether based on the figures of the previous\nowner, promoter's estimate, etc.) indicating the specific qualification of all persons making such projections and the basis upon which the\nprojections are made; specific coverage of \"maintenance charges\", and whether it includes utilities, telephone, garage, rights to recreational\nfacilities (such as swimming pools); whether the projection is based on joint contracting not obligatory by proprietary lease agreement; if the\ncooperative corporation is only one of several in the same development area, whether the projected charges are based on projections made for prior\nofferings; and if so, whether such prior projections have proved accurate; whether the applicable tax assessment has been made, and if not, how the\nreal estate taxes and other relevant taxes have been projected; and whether the projection is the work of, or has been approved by any government\nagency (such as FHA). (xiii)\n\nPromoters' (including builders') profits are specifically required by\nsection\n352-e\nof\nthe General Business Law. The profits of each promoter (including all dummy entities, nominees, agencies, or other intermediaries subject to his\ncontrol, directly or indirectly) shall be given or projected with conditioning language where the exact profit cannot be given. In the latter case, the maximum possible profit should be projected with a summary of the many conditions that may affect the eventual profit or loss. Where, however, part or all of the promoters' profits come solely from the sale or other transfer of land, building or interest therein, the original cost thereof\nand resulting profit need not be given if the particular promoter has held continuous control of such ownership or interest for three years prior to\nthe proposed first offering of cooperative apartments. (xiv)\n\nProvisions made for units unsold at the time\nthe cooperative takes title (including the name of the person to whom such reserved units may be transferred, whether or not they will be held by a\nnominee, the obligations assumed by such holder, any rights and restrictions which have been imposed on the selling price of reserved units, and the\nvoting position relative to such reserved units). (xv)\n\nThe description of major concessions to commercial\ntenants or purchasers or other transferees of apartments. For all conversions of existing rent controlled buildings in New York State, there shall be\nincluded a general summary in a short paragraph of essential provisions of municipal or State statutes and regulations which govern the rights of the\ntenants in occupancy not wishing to participate in the cooperative venture and the procedures necessary for the cooperative or nonoccupant purchaser\nto acquire possession from such tenants. (xvi)\n\nThe nature of any contractual obligations or bonds, whether in writing or otherwise, and conditions or limitations attached thereto. The word \"guarantee\" should be avoided, because of its misleading\nnature. (xvii)\nA projected statement of income and expenses for the first full year of operation by the\ncooperative organization with identification of the source of such projection and the basis thereof. If any such figures are expected to change in\nthe following year or years, it shall be so stated. (xviii)\n\nWhether or not a letter of adequacy for the\nprojected maintenance charges has been issued by the selling agent, managing agent or any other source. (xix)\n\nIf the cooperative organization itself has contracted new construction, a schedule of payments to the builder\nor contractor and indication whether there will be any certification prior to the disbursement of money at various stages of completion. (xx)\n\nAny existing law suits or other proceedings against the cooperative organization, any promoter, the managing\nagent, the sales agent or any other person or firm connected with the offering, which could materially affect this offering. (xxi)\n\nWhether or not there shall be distributed to stockholders any or all of the following annually: a tax\ndeduction statement, an annual report of total corporate affairs, including a balance sheet and profit and loss statement certified by an independent\ncertified public accountant (required by section\n352-e\nof the General Business Law); and a notice of the holding of an annual stockholders meeting for the\npurpose of election of a board of directors. (xxii)\nA summary of all contracts, appointments, agreements\nand binding obligations made by promoters (their nominees or dummies) that will be binding upon the cooperative organization after it is actually\ntenanted, setting forth the full details thereof, including the length of time of the obligations or arrangements and the reasons why binding\nagreements were made for the purpose involved (include garage concessions, laundry concessions, managing agent contracts, etc.), before the actual\ntenant stockholders could act upon these matters. (xxiii)\n\nIn a new construction, whether there will be a\ncompletion bond furnished by the builder and, if so, the relevant terms thereof; also the estimated date of beginning of construction, the estimated\ndate of completion of construction, the estimated date when occupancy will be permitted and the method of determining when the building will be\ncompleted. (xxiv)\nA summary of the major terms of the proprietary lease, including: relationship of stock\nrights to lease rights; the rights of possession and use of premises; voting rights; rights to sublet or assign and the conditions relative thereto; provisions in the event of default and nonpayment of maintenance charges, restrictions on the cancelability of lease; the duration of the lease. The\ninclusion in an offering plan of a true copy of the proprietary lease will ordinarily substantially reduce the need for greatly comprehensive detail\nin the summary portion of the offering plan. (xxv)\n\nThe terms governing deposits by prospective\nshareholders. (xxvi)\nA summary of important features of ground leases involved in the cooperative\nventure, including an explanation of rights and obligations on the expiration date of any such leases. (xxvii)\nA full description of the rights and obligations of the cooperative and management under any agreement made\nwith a managing agent, including: the assignability and cancelability of the management agreement by either side; the duration of the agreement and\nrenewability provisions, if any; fees paid to and other profits of the managing agent; whether the managing agent is or will be bonded; any\nrelationship between managing agent or any of its officers and any promoter of the cooperative venture. (xxviii)\nA special risk section that, if applicable, must be on a separate page, immediately following the table of\ncontents. All features of a plan which involve significant risk or will disproportionately or unusually affect maintenance charges or obligations of\ntenant shareholders in future years of cooperative operation must be conspicuously disclosed and highlighted. A brief description of the risk should\nbe given in this section and a more thorough description should be given in a referenced later section. Questions as to whether a risk should be\nhighlighted in this section should be resolved in favor of inclusion. Special risks include, but are not limited to, the examples set forth below: (a) If the subscription agreement is not contingent on obtaining financing, the purchaser's obligations to pay the\nbalance of the purchase price without regard to the availability of financing and purchaser's maximum loss upon failure to pay the balance of the\npurchase price must be explained. (b) If a mortgage has a balloon payment that is due in less than 10\nyears after the anticipated date of closing, the risks and costs of refinancing should be discussed. (c) If any nonresidential lease may generate less income than the\npro rata\nshare of expenses attributable to the leased space now or in\nthe future, or if the ratio of income generated by the lease to the share of expenses fairly attributable to the leased space may decline in the\nfuture, the potential burden to the apartment corporation should be highlighted and estimates of expenses and income for the lease term should be\nfully disclosed. (d) If any nonresidential lease does not give the apartment corporation control over the\nfuture use of the leased space, the possibility that the future use could be objectionable to the apartment corporation should be\nexplained.
