  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 47.3 - Examinations of sanitary condition of shellfish lands\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Certified\nshellfish lands. (1)\n\nThe department shall\nperiodically examine shellfish lands to determine the sanitary condition\nthereof. Such examinations, hereinafter referred to as sanitary surveys, shall\ninclude shoreline (pollution source) surveys and water quality evaluations\nconducted at a frequency determined by the commissioner to adequately protect\npublic health. Following a sanitary survey, the department shall on the basis\nof shoreline surveys and criteria contained in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision determine which of the examined shellfish lands are of such\nsanitary condition that shellfish may be taken therefrom for use as food. Lands\nthat meet such criteria shall be designated, by commissioner's order, 'certified shellfish lands'; except, no particular shellfish lands may be\ndesignated certified shellfish lands in the absence of a sanitary survey\nconducted within the previous 12 years. Lands that do not meet such criteria or\nhave not been subject to a sanitary survey within the previous 12 years shall\nbe designated, by commissioner's order, 'uncertified shellfish lands'. At any\ntime particular certified shellfish lands may be redesignated by commissioner's\norder as uncertified shellfish lands if such lands no longer meet the criteria\ncontained in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. The department, annually, and\nas often as it deems necessary, shall cause a notice describing certified\nshellfish lands and uncertified shellfish lands to be published in a newspaper\nwidely distributed in the county in which such lands are located. (2)\n\nWaters overlying certified shellfish\nlands shall: (i) not have received hazardous\namounts of contamination, which may have been occasioned by precipitation, storm water runoff, malfunctionings of waste water treatment facilities, spills\nof hazardous materials or other similar events; (ii)\nnot be so contaminated with fecal\nmaterial, radionuclides or industrial wastes that shellfish from such lands\nmight be hazardous for use as food; and\n(iii)\nhave, when samples are collected from\nthose portions of the certified lands most probably exposed to fecal\ncontamination during adverse hydrographic and pollution conditions: a median\n(or geometric mean) total coliform MPN per 100 milliliters of sample of 70 or\nless; and unless extenuating circumstances warrant otherwise, not more than 10\npercent of the samples have a total coliform MPN per 100 milliliters of sample\nin excess of 330 (or the MPN value at the estimated ninetieth percentile does\nnot exceed 330) when a multiple dilution fermentation tube test is used which\nexamines three 10-milliliter sample portions, three one-milliliter sample\nportions and three one-tenth (0.1) milliliter sample portions; and unless\nextenuating circumstances warrant otherwise, not more than 10 percent of the\nsamples have a total coliform MPN per 100 milliliters of sample in excess of\n230 (or the MPN value at the estimated ninetieth percentile does not exceed\n230) when a multiple dilution fermentation tube test is used which examines\nfive 10-milliliter sample portions, five one-milliliter sample portions, five\none-tenth (0.1) milliliter sample portions and five onehundredth (0.01)\nmilliliter sample portions; or\n(iv)\nhave, when samples are collected from those portions of the certified lands\nmost probably exposed to fecal contamination during adverse hydrographic and\npollution conditions: a median (or geometric mean) fecal coliform MPN per 100\nmilliliters of sample of 14 or less; and unless extenuating circumstances\nwarrant otherwise, not more than 10 percent of the samples have a fecal\ncoliform MPN per 100 milliliters of sample in excess of 49 (or the MPN value at\nthe estimated ninetieth percentile does not exceed 49) when a multiple dilution\nfermentation tube test is used which examines three 10-milliliter sample\nportions, three one-milliliter sample portions and three one-tenth (0.1)\nmilliliter sample portions; and unless extenuating circumstances warrant\notherwise, not more than 10 percent of the samples have a fecal coliform MPN\nper 100 milliliters of sample in excess of 43 (or the MPN value at the\nestimated ninetieth percentile does not exceed 43) when a multiple dilution\nfermentation tube test is used which examines five 10-milliliter sample\nportions, five one-milliliter sample portions and five one-tenth (0.1)\nmilliliter sample portions. (3)\n\nThe commissioner, in his discretion, may\ndesignate by order particular shellfish lands as certified shellfish lands if\ndetailed shoreline surveys or sanitary surveys of such lands indicate that the\ncoliform bacteria are not of fecal origin; and the commissioner, in his\ndiscretion, may designate by order particular uncertified shellfish lands as\ncertified shellfish lands during seasons when such lands meet the criteria\ncontained in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. At any time particular\ncertified shellfish lands may be redesignated by commissioner's order as\nuncertified shellfish lands, if such lands no longer meet the criteria\ncontained in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe commissioner may designate by order\nshellfish lands within and adjacent to marinas and mooring areas as uncertified\nshellfish lands when it is determined by sanitary survey that such lands may\nreceive hazardous amounts of fresh fecal material that may not ordinarily be\ndetected by routine water quality monitoring. (b) Conditionally certified shellfish lands. (1)\n\nThe department will regularly conduct\nsanitary surveys of appropriate uncertified shellfish lands that it has\ndetermined are likely to be periodically nonhazardous for purposes of\nharvesting shellfish for use as food. Following a sanitary survey the\ndepartment will, on the basis of criteria contained in paragraph (a)(2) of this\nsection, determine which of such shellfish lands are in such nonhazardous\ncondition that shellfish may be taken therefrom for use as food. Shellfish\nlands that meet such criteria may be designated by commissioner's order as\n\"conditionally certified shellfish lands\". At any time, particular\nconditionally certified shellfish lands may be redesignated by commissioner's\norder as \"uncertified shellfish lands\" if such lands no longer meet the\ncriteria contained in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Such orders must state\nwith specificity the boundaries of the lands so \"conditionally certified\" or\n\"uncertified\" by using reference points taken from appropriate United States\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration nautical charts or using\nreference points such as local landmarks or local names or using reference\npoints such as buoys or monuments when such buoys or monuments have been\ninstalled or maintained in a manner approved by the commissioner. Public notice\nof such orders will be given by posting in the State of New York Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation's Division of Marine Resources office; by\nannouncements by radio stations, when deemed necessary by the commissioner; by\na telephone system operated by the department or by a cooperating political\nsubdivision of the State of New York or both; and by other means approved by\nthe commissioner. (2)\n\nWaters\noverlying conditionally certified shellfish lands must meet the criteria\nspecified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or such lands will not be\ndesignated as conditionally certified. (c) Sanitary condition of harvest areas for\nmicrobiological cleansing. (1)\n\nThe department\nmay designate appropriate uncertified shellfish lands as suitable for the\nharvesting of shellfish for microbiological cleansing. Uncertified shellfish\nlands will not be designated as suitable for the harvest of shellfish for\nmicrobiological cleansing unless it has been determined that shellfish from\nsuch lands are not contaminated with fecal material, radionuclides or\nindustrial wastes to such a degree that consumption of such shellfish might be\nhazardous. Following a sanitary survey the department may, on the basis of\ncriteria contained in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, identify which of the\nexamined uncertified shellfish lands are of such sanitary condition that\nshellfish may be taken therefrom for microbiological cleansing. (2)\n\nUncertified shellfish lands must not be\ndesignated as suitable for the harvesting of shellfish for microbiological\ncleansing unless it has been determined that waters overlying such lands: (i) are not contaminated with fecal material, radionuclides or industrial wastes to such a degree that consumption of\nshellfish from such lands might be hazardous; and\n(ii)\nhave, when samples are collected from\nthose portions of the uncertified lands most probably exposed to fecal\ncontamination during adverse hydrographic and pollution conditions, median (or\ngeometric mean) total coliform MPN per 100 milliliters of sample of 700 or\nless; and unless extenuating circumstances warrant otherwise, not more than 10\npercent of the samples have a total coliform MPN per 100 milliliters of sample\nin excess of 3,300 (or the MPN value at the estimated ninetieth percentile does\nnot exceed 3,300) when a multiple dilution fermentation tube test is used which\nexamines three 10-milliliter sample portions, three 1-milliliter sample\nportions, three one-tenth (0.1) milliliter sample portions and three\none-hundredth (0.01) milliliter sample portions; when a multiple dilution\nfermentation tube test is used which examines five sample portions in each\ndilution, unless extenuating circumstances warrant otherwise, not more than 10\npercent of the total coliform MPN values exceed 2,300 (or the MPN value at the\nestimated ninetieth percentile does not exceed 2,300); or\n(iii)\nhave, when samples are collected from\nthose portions of the uncertified lands most probably exposed to fecal\ncontamination during adverse hydrographic and pollution conditions, median (or\ngeometric mean) fecal coliform MPN per 100 milliliters of sample of 88 or less; and unless extenuating circumstances warrant otherwise, not more than 10\npercent of the samples have a fecal coliform MPN per 100 milliliters of sample\nin excess of 300 (or the MPN value at the estimated ninetieth percentile does\nnot exceed 300) when a multiple dilution fermentation tube test is used which\nexamines three 10-milliliter sample portions, three 1-milliliter sample\nportions, three one-tenth (0.1) milliliter sample portions and three\none-hundredth (0.01) milliliter sample portions; when a multiple dilution\nfermentation tube test is used which examines five sample portions in each\ndilution, unless extenuating circumstances warrant otherwise, not more than 10\npercent of the fecal coliform MPN values will exceed 260 (or the MPN value at\nthe estimated ninetieth percentile does not exceed 260). (d) Samples of water, shellfish\nand other materials shall be collected and examined in a manner endorsed and/or\napproved by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Public\n\nHealth Service and Food and Drug Administration. Laboratories engaged in the\nbacteriological examination of water, shellfish and other materials shall have\nreceived and shall maintain a satisfactory evaluation by the United States\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service and Food and\n\nDrug Administration in order for results of such examinations to be acceptable\nto the department.
