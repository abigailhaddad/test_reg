  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 340.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nSections\n40, 500\nand\n600\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw provide that individuals in certain categories of employment are eligible, but not required, to join the New York State Employees' Retirement System. These individuals join the New York State Employees' Retirement System upon\nfiling a membership application with the Comptroller, and are referred to as\n\"optional members.\" Pursuant to those provisions, the Retirement System has\nestablished a practice of determining the date of membership of such optional\nmembers as the date on which the appropriate membership application is filed\nwith the Comptroller. Court decisions have consistently held that a Retirement\n\nSystem document is filed with the Comptroller for Retirement and Social\n\nSecurity Law purposes on the date that it is received by the office or\nindividual responsible for receiving such document. Accordingly, the Retirement\n\nSystem has established a longstanding practice of determining the date of\nmembership for optional members as the date on which the membership application\nis received by the Comptroller. This Part is promulgated to set forth the\nprocedures to be used in establishing the date of membership in the New York\n\nState Employees' Retirement System for individuals in categories of employment\nwhich render them optional members of said system. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n340.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
