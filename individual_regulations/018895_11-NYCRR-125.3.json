The insurer shall properly consider and account for all factors associated with such an agreement, including: (1)\ncompliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements; (2)\nthe net risk to be retained; (3)\nconcentration of risk on a net and gross basis; (4)\nprojections as to reasonable future availability and affordability of adequate levels of reinsurance support for the ceding insurer's ongoing operations; (5)\nthe degree to which future reinsurance proceeds for existing and future ceded reserves are likely to be recoverable based upon best available current information; (6)\nthe way an assuming insurer will be selected, including how to assess its security; (7)\nhow the reinsurance program will be monitored (i.e., the reporting and internal control systems); and\n(8)\nthat the terms of agreements with any affiliated assuming insurer are fair and equitable.
