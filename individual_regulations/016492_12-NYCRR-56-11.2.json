  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-11.2 - Emergency projects\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Air sampling and analysis. Air sampling and analysis on emergency asbestos\nprojects shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of Subpart 56-4\nof this Part. (b) Where allowed. Permissible under this section are only those projects that are deemed by the\ncommissioner or his or her duly authorized representative as being necessary to\nrespond to an unexpected, unanticipated or unforeseen occurrence, including but\nnot limited to, an incidental disturbance of ACM, PACM or asbestos material, a\nsteam, chemical, gas or water line rupture, or boiler failure or a\nbuilding/structure collapse, which poses: (1)\nan imminent danger to the health and safety of the public; or\n(2)\nan asbestos related risk to the health\nand safety of the public from release of airborne asbestos fibers. (c) Licensing and certification. Emergency asbestos projects conducted under this Subpart shall comply with the\nrequirements of sections\n56-3.1, 56-3.2 and\n56-3.3\nof this Part. (d) Notification. Prior to the commencement\nof an emergency asbestos project, the asbestos abatement contractor shall\ncomply with the emergency asbestos project notification requirements set forth\nin sections 56-3.5 and\n56-3.6\nof this Part. (e) Approved emergency project. If permission\nto proceed as an emergency asbestos project is granted as per this subdivision\nand section\n56-3.5\nof this Part, all work done\non the project must be performed in a manner consistent with applicable\nprovisions of this Part or with approved variance conditions required by the\ncommissioner or his or her designee. If the asbestos project will be completed\nusing alternative procedures defined within a site-specific variance, the\napproved variance decision must be obtained prior to proceeding with the\nasbestos project. If permission to proceed with the emergency asbestos project\nis denied, all work shall be performed in accordance with all applicable\nprovisions of this Part. (f) Corrective actions for incidental disturbance of asbestos containing materials. (1)\n\nUpon discovery, the affected area shall\nbe cordoned off with barrier tape at a distance of 25 feet from the outer most\nlimit of the disturbance. This shall be considered the regulated abatement work\narea for the cleanup of the disturbed materials. The regulated abatement work\narea shall be immediately cordoned off and adequate signage shall be posted as\ndescribed in section 56- 7.4 of this Part. After evaluation and emergency\nnotification for the incidental disturbance as per section\n56-3.5\nof this Part, the following\napplies: (i) A minimum of a small project\ndecontamination system enclosure, which may be remote from the work area, shall\nbe installed and utilized for the asbestos project. For interior regulated\nabatement work areas critical barriers shall be installed as per section\n56-7.11\nof this Part, or an\nappropriately sized tent enclosure shall be installed to serve as an isolation\nbarrier, dependent upon the size and configuration of the area disturbed. Then\nnegative air ventilation systems shall be established as per section\n56-7.8\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (ii)\n\nFor outdoor regulated\nabatement work areas, all adjacent building openings within 25 feet of the\noutermost limit of the disturbance shall be sealed with two layers of six mil\nfire-retardant plastic sheeting. (2)\n\nTent enclosures if necessary, shall be\nconstructed as per section 56- 7.11(f)(1) of this Part to surround the area of\ndisturbance. The tent shall be sealed to the surfaces beyond the limits of\ncontamination, and those surfaces of the tent enclosure (wall, ceiling, or\nfloor) shall not require plastic sheeting. An attached airlock is\nrequired. (3)\n\nDue to the nature of\nthis work, background air samples shall not be required. (4)\n\nWet methods shall be employed to minimize\nfurther disturbance of the affected material during cleanup activities. No\nremoval of undisturbed ACM, PACM or asbestos material shall be allowed during\nthe incidental disturbance cleanup emergency asbestos project. (5)\n\nVisual inspection. Once final cleaning is\ncomplete, a visual inspection shall be completed by the supervisor to confirm\nthat the scope of abatement work for the asbestos project is complete, and no\nvisible debris/residue, pools of liquid, or condensation remain. (6)\n\nRemoval of personal protective equipment. The worker's disposable protective clothing shall be removed and left in the\nincidental disturbance work area upon exiting. (7)\n\nExiting procedures. After exiting the\ntent, workers shall immediately don clean protective clothing within the\nattached airlock. Workers shall then proceed immediately to a shower for\ndecontamination. (8)\n\nFinal cleaning\nand clearance procedures. Final clean-up procedures shall comply with Subpart\n56-9 of this Part, except that only one stage of cleaning (final) is to be\nperformed. Lockdown encapsulant use is not required except for porous\ncontaminated surfaces subject to cleaning. After clean-up is complete, a visual\ninspection followed by completion of clearance procedures, shall be performed\nconsistent with the requirements of Subpart 56-9 of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-11.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
