  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 400.12 - Proposed findings of fact\n\nState Regulations\n\nAny party may submit proposed findings of fact within time\nlimitations set by the administrative law judge. Such findings of fact shall be\ncaptioned, entitled as such, shall be consecutively numbered and shall be typed\nlegibly on plain, white bond, standard weight paper, 8 1/2 x 11 inches in size. Such proposed findings of fact shall recite basic facts and not evidentiary\nfacts and shall not be conclusions of law. A basic fact would be \"John Jones\nvisited Syracuse,\" and not \"John Jones testified that he visited Syracuse,\"\nwhich is an evidentiary fact. A conclusion of law would be \"John Jones has\ndemonstrated untrustworthiness within the meaning of section\n441-c\nof\nthe Real Property Law.\" In general, it is expected that the complaint will\nallege the basic facts which would otherwise be contained in a statement of\nproposed findings of fact. In accordance with section 301(1) of the State\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act, the person assigned to render a decision will\nrule on each finding of fact. Such decision maker will do so by marking the\ninstrument setting forth the proposed findings of fact a part of the decision\nand noting in the margin thereof the ruling, i.e.,\"Found,\" \"Not Found,\"\n\"Irrelevant,\" \"Evidentiary,\" \"Conclusion of Law,\" which rulings may be\nabbreviated meaningfully. The body of the decision will contain such findings\nof fact as the decision maker deems relevant, but need not be expressed in the\nsame language as presented in the proposed findings. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n400.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
