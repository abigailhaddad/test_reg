  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 645-7.6 - Dock, Mooring and Wharf Fees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No person shall use or construct a dock, wharf or mooring on the waters of the\n\nPark without paying the fee required by this Section. (b) The owner of a dock, wharf or mooring\nused for residential purposes shall pay an annual fee of $50.00 for each such\ndock, wharf or mooring. (c) The\nowner of an association dock, wharf or mooring shall pay an annual fee in the\namount of $50.00 times the total number of units with deeded or contractual\naccess to the association docks, wharfs or moorings, or the actual number of\nvessels capable of being docked or moored at the association docks, wharfs or\nmoorings, whichever is less. (d) The owner of a dock or wharf used for commercial purposes shall pay an annual\nfee of five dollars ($5.00) per useable linear foot for each such dock or\nwharf. Useable linear footage shall be measured as the distance along the\nlongest side of any structure used as a dock or wharf, together with the length\nof the longest side of all lateral structures which extend from the dock or\nwharf and which are capable of sustaining foot traffic for access to and from\nvessels and/or for berthing vessels. No linear distance shall be counted twice\nfor the purpose of determining the fee required pursuant to this paragraph. Docks or wharfs which connect to shore shall be measured from the point where\nthe decking or walkway intersects the shore, but in no event beyond the mean\nhighwater mark. For the convenience of the regulated community, examples of\ntypical dock configurations and the applicable fees are provided in this\n\nSubdivision. Image\n(e) The owner of a mooring used for\ncommercial purposes shall pay an annual fee of $100 for each such\nmooring. (f) The owner of a dock or\nwharf constructed on or after January 1, 1988 used for commercial purposes\nshall pay a first time fee of $10.00 per useable linear foot for each such dock\nor wharf. Useable linear footage shall be calculated in accordance with\nparagraph (d) of this Section. Such fee shall be payable prior to the issuance\nof a permit to construct the dock or wharf and shall be in lieu of the fee\nassessable pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section for the calendar year in\nwhich such a permit is issued. Each successive year thereafter, the owner shall\npay the fee required by paragraph (d) of this Section. This provision shall not\napply to the replacement in kind of an existing dock or wharf, but shall apply\nto any modification, extension, or expansion of an existing dock or\nwharf. (g) The owner of each quick\nlaunch facility shall, in addition to the fees assessable pursuant to other\nparagraphs of this Section, pay an annual fee of $5.00 per usable linear foot\nfor the total useable linear footage of dry storage capacity at the quick\nlaunch subject to the following: (1)\n\nWhere\nthe quick launch facility uses wet storage capacity exclusively for vessels\nwhich are quick launched, the total useable linear footage of such capacity\nshall be subtracted from the total useable linear footage of dry storage\ncapacity to prevent the double assessment of storage capacity which is used by\nthe same vessels; and\n(2)\n\nWhere a\nquick launch facility does not use a rack storage or other system where the\nuseable linear footage of storage capacity is measurable, the owner shall pay\nan annual fee based upon the total estimated linear footage of the vessels to\nbe stored during a calendar year. Such owners shall, prior to April 1st of each\nyear, estimate the total linear footage of vessels to be stored during that\ncalendar year and shall pay the fee required by this subparagraph based upon\nthat estimate. The estimate required herein shall not be less than the total\nlinear footage of vessels stored during the previous calendar year, unless the\nowner demonstrates why the amount should be less. The commission shall not be\nbound by such an estimate if its staff determines it to be unreasonable, in\nwhich event the staff may calculate the estimated fee. Any person who is\nrequired to pay a regulatory fee based upon an estimate shall, on or before\n\nOctober 1st of the year in which such an estimate is given, report to the\ncommission on such forms as the commission may prescribe the actual linear\nfootage vessels stored during that calendar year. Such reports shall be\nverified by the owner or operator. Any amount which is disclosed to be due and\npayable to the commission shall be due and payable on October 1st of such year\nand shall be subject to a penalty in accordance with the provisions of Section\n645-7.4\nof\nthis Subpart if not paid within 30 days of such date. Any excess amount shall\nbe credited against the regulatory fee due and payable for the next succeeding\nfiscal year. Any dispute over the computation of such a recalculated fee shall\nbe resolved under the procedures of Section\n645-7.5\nof this Subpart. (h) Upon the registration of a dock, wharf or mooring, the owner shall affix the\nregistration placard provided by the commission to the structure in a manner\nthat makes it visible from the lake, if possible.
