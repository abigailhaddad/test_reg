(b) E-filing in\nactions in Supreme Court. Except as otherwise provided in section\n202.5b\nb of this Part, the\nfollowing shall apply to all actions in Supreme Court: (1)\n\nCommencing an action by electronic means. A party may commence any action in the Supreme Court in any county (provided\nthat e-filing has been authorized in that county and in the class of actions to\nwhich that action belongs pursuant to paragraph [a][1] of this section) by\nelectronically filing the initiating documents with the county clerk through\nthe NYSCEF site. When so authorized, a petition to commence a proceeding for\nreview of a small claims assessment pursuant to Real Property Tax Law section\n730\nmay\nbe e-filed, including as follows: the petition, in the form prescribed by the\n\nChief Administrator in accordance with such section, shall be completed and\nsigned in hard copy as provided in that section and shall be e-filed by\ntransmission to the NYSCEF site, in conformity with procedures established by\nthe site, of a text file containing all of the information set forth in the\ncompleted and executed hard copy petition (exclusive of the signature[s]). Upon\nreceipt of such transmission, the site shall generate and record the completed\npetition in proper form in portable document format. (2)\nE-filing in an action after commencement. (i) Consent of the parties required. After\ncommencement of an action wherein e-filing is authorized, documents may be\nelectronically filed and served, but only by, and electronic service shall be\nmade only upon, a party or parties who have consented thereto. A party's\nfailure to consent to participation in electronic filing and service shall not\nbar any other party to the action from filing documents electronically with the\ncounty clerk and the court or serving documents upon any other party who has\nconsented to participation. A party who has not consented to participation\nshall file documents with the court and the county clerk, and serve and be\nserved with documents, in hard copy. When an e-filing party serves a document\nin hard copy on a non-participating party, the document served shall bear full\nsignatures of all signatories and proof of such service shall be filed\nelectronically. (ii)\n\nConsent to\ne-filing; how obtained. Notwithstanding the following, no party shall be\ncompelled, directly or indirectly, to participate in e-filing pursuant to this\nsection. A consent to e-filing in an action shall state that the party\nproviding it agrees to the use of e-filing in the action and to be bound by the\nfiling and service provisions in this section. A party who has commenced an\naction electronically shall serve upon the other parties together with the\ninitiating documents a notice regarding availability of e-filing in a form\napproved by the Chief Administrator. Such notice shall provide sufficient\ninformation in plain language concerning e-filing. A party who seeks to use\ne-filing in a pending action shall serve said notice upon all other parties. Whenever such a notice is served, proof of service thereof shall be transmitted\nto the court. Service of such a notice shall constitute consent to e-filing in\nthe action by the party causing such service to be made. Except for an\nunrepresented litigant, a party served with such a notice shall promptly file\nwith the court and serve on all parties of record either a consent or a\ndeclination of consent. An authorized e-filing user may file a consent\nelectronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Consent may also be\nobtained by stipulation. An unrepresented litigant is exempt from having to\nfile and serve documents electronically in accordance with this section and\nneed not respond to the notice described herein; except that he or she may file\na consent to participate in e-filing provided the clerk shall first have\nexplained his or her options for e-filing in plain language, including the\noption for expedited processing, and inquired whether he or she wishes to\nparticipate. Where an unrepresented litigant opts to file a consent hereunder, it shall be documented in the case file in a manner prescribed by the Chief\n\nAdministrator. Provided, however, that where an unrepresented litigant chooses\nto participate in e-filing in accordance with these rules, he or she may at any\ntime opt out of such participation by presenting the clerk of the court with a\nform so declaring. The filing of a consent to e-filing hereunder shall not\nconstitute an appearance in the action. (iii)\n\nDocuments previously filed with the\ncourt; termination or modification of e-filing procedures. When an action\nbecomes subject to e-filing, the court may direct that documents previously\nfiled in the action in hard copy be filed electronically by the parties. The\ncourt may at any time order discontinuation of e-filing in such action or\nmodification of e-filing procedures therein in order to prevent prejudice and\npromote substantial justice. (c) Authorized e-filing users, passwords and registration. (1)\n\nRegistration required. Documents may be filed or served electronically only by\na person who has registered as an authorized e-filing user or as otherwise\nprovided in this subdivision. (2)\n\nRegistering as an authorized e-filing user. (i) Who may register. An attorney admitted to\npractice in the State of New York, or a person seeking to serve as an\nauthorized e-filing agent on behalf of attorneys of record in an e-filed action\nor actions (hereinafter \"filing agent\") may register as an authorized e-filing\nuser of the NYSCEF site. An attorney admitted\npro hac vice\nin\nan action, an unrepresented litigant, or a person who has been authorized in\nwriting by an owner or owners of real property to submit a petition as provided\nin section\n730\nof\nthe Real Property Tax Law and who has been licensed to engage in such business\nas required by the jurisdiction in which the business is operated (hereinafter\n\"small claims assessment review filing agent\") may also register as an\nauthorized e-filing user, by solely for purposes of such action or, in the case\nof a small claims assessment review filing agent, solely for those proceedings\nunder section\n730\nof\nthe Real Property Tax Law in which he or she has been authorized to submit a\npetition. (ii)\n\nHow to register. Registration shall be on a form prescribed by the Chief Administrator. If so\nprovided by the Chief Administrator, registration shall not be complete until\nthe registering person has been approved as an e-filing user. An authorized\ne-filing user shall notify the resource center immediately of any change in the\ninformation provided on his or her registration form. (3)\n\nIdentification and password. Upon\nregistration, an authorized e-filing user shall be issued a confidential user\nidentification designation (\"user ID\") and a password by the Unified Court\n\nSystem (\"UCS\"). An authorized e-filing user shall maintain his or her user ID\nand password as confidential, except as provided in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision. Upon learning of the compromise of the confidentiality of either\nthe user ID or the password, an authorized e-filing user shall immediately\nnotify the resource center. At its initiative or upon request, the UCS may at\nany time issue a new user ID or password to any authorized e-filing\nuser. (4)\n\nUser ID and password; use\nby authorized person. An authorized e-filing user may authorize another person\nto file a document electronically on his or her behalf in a particular action\nusing the user ID and password of the user, but, in such event, the authorized\ne-filing user shall retain full responsibility for any document\nfiled. (d) Electronic filing of documents. (1)\n\nElectronic filing of documents. (i) Electronic filing required; format of\ne-filed documents; statement of authorization. In any action subject to\ne-filing, all documents required to be filed with the court by a party that has\nconsented to such e-filing shall be filed and served electronically, except as\nprovided in this section. Documents shall be e-filed in text-searchable\nportable document format (PDF-A) and shall otherwise comply with the technical\nrequirements set forth at the NYSCEF site. A filing agent (other than one\nemployed by a governmental entity) shall e-file a statement of authorization\nfrom counsel of record in an action, in a form approved by the Chief\n\nAdministrator, prior to or together with the first e-filing in that action by\nthe agent on behalf of that counsel. (ii)\n\nEmergency exception; other hard copy\nfilings. Documents that are required to be filed and served electronically in\naccordance with this section or section\n202.5bb\n(c)(1)\nof\nthis Part may nevertheless be filed and served in hard copy where required by\nstatute or court order, where the document is an application that may by\nstatute be presented without notice, or provided the document is accompanied by\nthe affirmation or affidavit of the filing attorney or party stating that: (a) a deadline for filing and service fixed\nby statute, rule or order of the court will expire on the day the document is\nbeing filed and served or on the following business day; and\n(b) the attorney, party or filing agent\ntherefor is unable to file and serve such document electronically because of\ntechnical problems with his or her computer equipment or Internet connection. In the event a filer shall file and serve documents in hard copy pursuant to\nthis paragraph, each such document shall include the notice required by this\nparagraph, and the filer shall file those documents with the NYSCEF site within\nthree business days thereafter. (iii)\n\nForm of notice required on hard copy\nfiling. Where an action is subject to e-filing and a party or attorney seeks to\nfile a document therein in hard copy, such document shall include, on a\nseparate page firmly affixed thereto, a notice of hard copy submission, in a\nform approved by the Chief Administrator, that the party or attorney: (a) is authorized to and does withhold\nconsent to e-filing; (b) is exempt\nfrom having to e-file; or\n(c) is\nauthorized or required to file such document in hard copy pursuant to an\nexception provided in these Rules or other provision of law. (2)\n\nPayment of fees. Whenever documents are filed electronically that require the payment of a\nfiling fee, the person who files the documents shall provide therewith, in\npayment of the fee: (i) such credit card\ninformation as shall be required at the NYSCEF site to permit a card to be\ncharged by the county clerk; or\n(ii)\nthe form or information required by the\ncounty clerk to permit him or her to debit an account maintained with the\ncounty clerk by an attorney or law firm appearing for a party to the action; or\n(iii)\nsuch information as shall\nbe required at the NYSCEF site to permit an automated clearinghouse debit to be\nmade; or\n(iv)\nany other form of\npayment authorized by the Chief Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where permitted by the\ncounty clerk, an authorized e-filing user who electronically files documents\nthat require the payment of a filing fee may cause such fee to be paid\nthereafter at the office of the county clerk. (3)\n\nFiling and receipt of documents; notification. (i) When documents are filed. Documents may be transmitted at any time of the day or night to the NYSCEF\nsite. A document is filed when its electronic transmission or, in the case of a\npetition that is e-filed by submission of a text file as provided in paragraph\n(b)(1) of this section, the electronic transmission of the text file is\nrecorded at that site, provided, however, that where payment of a fee is\nrequired upon the filing of a document, the document is not filed until\ntransmission of the document and the information or form or information as\nrequired in subparagraph (2)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this subdivision has been\nrecorded at the NYSCEF site; or, if no transmission of that information or form\nor information is recorded, until payment is presented to the county\nclerk. (ii)\n\nNotification. No later\nthan the close of business on the business day following the electronic filing\nof a document, a notification, in a form prescribed by the Chief Administrator, shall be transmitted electronically by the NYSCEF site to the person filing\nsuch document and all other parties participating in e-filing. When documents\ninitiating an action are filed electronically, the county clerk shall assign an\nindex number or filing number to the action and that number shall be\ntransmitted to the person filing such documents as part of the notification. If, where permitted, payment is submitted after the initiating documents have\nbeen transmitted electronically, the county clerk shall assign the number upon\npresentation of that payment. (4)\n\nOfficial record; maintenance of files; working copies. When a document has been filed electronically pursuant to this\nsection, the official record shall be the electronic recording of the document\nstored by the county clerk. The county clerk or his or her designee may scan\nand e-file documents that were filed in hard copy in an action subject to\ne-filing or maintain those documents in hard copy form. All documents\nmaintained by the county clerk as the official electronic record shall also be\nfiled in the NYSCEF system. Where a document that was filed in hard copy is\nthereafter e-filed, the filing date recorded in NYSCEF shall be the date of\nhard copy filing. The court may require the parties to provide working copies\nof documents filed electronically. In such event, each working copy shall\ninclude, firmly affixed thereto, a copy of a confirmation notice in a form\nprescribed by the Chief Administrator. (5)\n\nDecisions, orders and judgments. Unless\nthe court directs otherwise, any document that requires a judge's signature\nshall be transmitted electronically and in hard copy to the court. Unless the\n\nChief Administrator authorizes use of electronic signatures, decisions, orders\nand judgments signed by a judge shall be signed in hard copy. All signed\ndecisions, orders and judgments shall be converted into electronic form and\ntransmitted to the NYSCEF site by the appropriate clerk. (6)\n\nExhibits and other documents in hard\ncopy. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, and subject to such\nguidelines as may be established by the Chief Administrator, the county clerk\nor his or her designee may require or permit a party to file in hard copy, in\naccordance with procedures set by the county clerk or designee, an exhibit or\nother document which it is impractical or inconvenient to file\nelectronically.

An electronically filed document shall be considered to have been\nsigned by, and shall be binding upon, the person identified as a signatory, if: (i) it bears the physical signature of such\nperson and is scanned into an electronic format that reproduces such signature; or\n(ii)\nthe signatory has\nelectronically affixed the digital image of his or her signature to the\ndocument; or\n(iii)\nit is\nelectronically filed under the user ID and password of that person; or\n(iv)\nin a tax certiorari action\nin which the parties have stipulated to this procedure, it is an initiating\ndocument that is electronically filed without the signature of the signatory in\na form provided above in this subparagraph, provided that, prior to filing, the\ndocument is signed in full in hard copy (which hard copy must be preserved\nuntil the conclusion of all proceedings, including appeals, in the case in\nwhich it is filed); (v) in a small\nclaims assessment review proceeding, it is a petition recorded by the NYSCEF\nsite upon the filing of a text file as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this\nsection, provided that prior to filing, the document was signed in full in hard\ncopy (which hard copy must be preserved until the conclusion of all proceedings\nin the matter, including article 78 review and any appeals, and must be made\navailable during the proceeding upon request of the respondent or the court); or\n(vi)\nit otherwise bears the\nelectronic signature of the signatory in a format conforming to such standards\nand requirements as may hereafter be established by the Chief\n\nAdministrator. (2)\n\nCompliance with Part 130 of this Title. A document shall be considered to have\nbeen signed by an attorney or party in compliance with section\n130-1.1\n-a of this Title if it has\nbeen signed by such attorney or party as provided in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision and it bears the signatory's name. (3)\n\nCertification of signature. A judge, party or attorney may add his or her signature to a stipulation or other filed\ndocument by signing and filing, or causing to be filed, a certification of\nsignature for such document in a form prescribed by the Chief\n\nAdministrator. (f) Service of documents. (1)\n\nService of initiating documents in an action. Initiating documents may be\nserved in hard copy pursuant to article 3 of the CPLR, or, in tax certiorari\ncases, pursuant to the Real Property Tax Law, and shall bear full signatures as\nrequired thereby, or by electronic means if the party served agrees to accept\nsuch service. In the case of a proceeding to review a small claims assessment\nwhere the petition has been e-filed by the submission of a text file as\nprovided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a hard copy of the petition, fully completed and signed as set forth in that paragraph, shall be mailed, and\nshall be served upon the assessing unit or tax commission, as provided in\nsection\n730\nof\nthe Real Property Tax Law, unless otherwise stipulated. A party served by\nelectronic means shall, within 24 hours of service, provide the serving party\nor attorney with an electronic confirmation that the service has been\neffected. (2)\n\nService of\ninterlocutory documents in an e-filed action. (i) E-mail address for service. Each party in\nan action subject to electronic filing that has consented thereto shall\nidentify on an appropriate form an e-mail address at which service of\ninterlocutory documents on that party may be made through notification\ntransmitted by the NYSCEF site (hereinafter the \"e-mail service address\"). Each\nfiling user shall promptly notify the resource center in the event of a change\nin his or her e-mail service address. (ii)\n\nHow service is made. Where parties to an\naction have consented to e-filing, a party causes service of an interlocutory\ndocument to be made upon another party participating in e-filing by filing the\ndocument electronically. Upon receipt of an interlocutory document, the NYSCEF\nsite shall automatically transmit electronic notification to all e-mail service\naddresses in such action. Such notification shall provide the title of the\ndocument received, the date received, and the names of those appearing on the\nlist of e-mail service addresses to whom that notification is being sent. Each\nparty receiving the notification shall be responsible for accessing the NYSCEF\nsite to obtain a copy of the document received. Except as provided otherwise in\nparagraph (h)(3) of this section, the electronic transmission of the\nnotification shall constitute service of the document on the e-mail service\naddresses identified therein, however, such service will not be effective if\nthe filing party learns that the notification did not reach the address of the\nperson to be served. Proof of such service will be recorded on the NYSCEF site. A party may, however, utilize other service methods permitted by the CPLR\nprovided that, if one of such other methods is used, proof of that service\nshall be filed electronically. (g) Addition of parties or proposed\nintervenors in a pending e-filed action. A party to be added in an action subject to e-filing shall\nbe served with initiating documents in hard copy together with the notice\nregarding availability of e-filing specified in subparagraph (b)(2)(ii) of this\nsection, to which response shall be made as set forth in that paragraph. A\nproposed intervenor or other non-party who seeks relief from the court in an\naction subject to e-filing, if consenting to e-filing, shall promptly file and\nserve a consent. If an added party or intervenor does not consent to e-filing, subsequent documents shall be served by and on that party or intervenor in hard\ncopy but the action shall continue as an e-filed one as to all consenting\nparties. (h) Entry of\norders and judgments and notice of entry. (1)\n\nEntry; date of entry. In an action\nsubject to e-filing, the county clerk or his or her designee shall file orders\nand judgments of the court electronically, which shall constitute entry of the\norder or judgment. The date of entry shall be the date on which transmission of\nthe order or judgment is recorded at the NYSCEF site. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, if the county clerk receives an order or judgment and places a\nfiling stamp and date thereon reflecting that the date of receipt is the date\nof filing but does not e-file the document until a later day, the clerk shall\nrecord at the NYSCEF site as the date of entry the date shown on the filing\nstamp. (2)\n\nNotice requesting entry\nof judgment. The county clerk may require that a party seeking entry of\njudgment electronically serve upon the county clerk, in a form specified by the\ncounty clerk, a request for entry of judgment. (3)\n\nNotification; service of notice of entry\nby parties. Upon entry of an order or judgment, the NYSCEF site shall transmit\nto the e-mail service addresses a notification of receipt of such entry, which\nshall not constitute service of notice of entry by any party. A party shall\nserve notice of entry of an order or judgment on another party by serving a\ncopy of the notification received from the NYSCEF site, a copy of the order or\njudgment and written notice of its entry. A party may serve such documents\nelectronically by filing them with the NYSCEF site and thus causing\ntransmission by the site of notification of receipt of the documents, which\nshall constitute service thereof by the filer. In the alternative, a party may\nserve a copy of the order or judgment and written notice of its entry in hard\ncopy by any method set forth in CPLR 2103(b)(1) to (6). If service is made in\nhard copy by any such method and a copy of the order or judgment and notice of\nits entry and proof of such hard copy service are thereafter filed with the\nNYSCEF site, transmission by NYSCEF of notification of receipt of those\ndocuments shall not constitute additional service of the notice of entry on the\nparties to whom the notification is sent. (i) Technical failures. The NYSCEF site shall be considered to be subject to a\ntechnical failure on a given day if the site is unable to accept filings or\nprovide access to filed documents continuously or intermittently over the\ncourse of any period of time greater than one hour after 12:00 noon of that\nday. Notice of all such technical failures shall be provided on the site. When\ne-filing is hindered by a technical failure, a party may file with the\nappropriate clerk and serve in hard copy. With the exception of deadlines that\nby law cannot be extended, the time for filing of any document that is delayed\ndue to technical failure of the site shall be extended for one day for each day\non which such failure occurs, unless otherwise ordered by the court. In the\nevent an attorney or party shall file and serve documents in hard copy pursuant\nto this paragraph, each such document shall include the notice required by\nparagraph (d)(1) of this section, and the filer shall file those documents with\nthe NYSCEF site within three business days after restoration or normal\noperations at that site. (j) Electronic filing of discovery materials. In any action subject to e-filing, parties and non-parties\nproducing materials in response to discovery demands may enter into a\nstipulation, which shall be filed, authorizing the electronic filing of\ndiscovery responses and discovery materials to the degree and upon terms and\nconditions set forth in the stipulation. In the absence of such a stipulation, no party shall file electronically any such materials except in the form of\nexcerpts, quotations, or selected exhibits from such materials as part of\nmotion papers, pleadings or other filings with the court. (k) Copyright, confidentiality and\nother proprietary rights. (1)\n\nSubmissions pursuant to e-filing procedures shall have the same copyright, confidentiality and proprietary rights as paper documents. (2)\n\nIn an action subject to e-filing, any\nperson may apply for an order prohibiting or restricting the electronic filing\nin the action of specifically identified materials on the grounds that such\nmaterials are subject to copyright or other proprietary rights, or trade secret\nor other privacy interests, and that electronic filing in the action is likely\nto result in substantial prejudice to those rights or interests. Unless\notherwise permitted by the court, a motion for such an order shall be filed not\nless than 10 days before the materials to which the motion pertains are due to\nbe produced or filed with the court.
