The test result of such\nlaboratory shall include an assessment of the measurement uncertainty and\nimprecision of the quantitative threshold for the substance. (1)\n\nAcepromazine: 10 ng/ml HEPS in\nurine; (2)\n\nAlbuterol: 1 ng/ml in\nurine; (3)\n\nBetamethasone: 10 pg/ml\nin plasma; (4)\n\nButorphanol: (i) 300 ng/ml of total butorphanol in urine; or\n(ii)\n2 ng/ml of free butorphanol\nin plasma; (5)\n\nCetirizine: 6 ng/ml in plasma; (6)\n\nCimetidine: 400 ng/ml in plasma; (7)\n\nClenbuterol: (i) 140 pg/ml in urine; or\n(ii)\nany clenbuterol in plasma; (8)\n\nCobalt: 50 ng/ml in\nplasma; (9)\n\nDantrolene: 100 pg/ml\nof 5-hydroxydantrolene in plasma; (10)\n\nDetomidine: (i) 2 ng/ml of any metabolite of detomidine\nin urine; or\n(ii)\n1 ng/ml of\ndetomidine in plasma; (11)\n\nDexamethasone: 5 pg/ml in\nplasma; (12)\n\nDiclofenac: 5 ng/ml in\nplasma; (13)\nDMSO: 10 mcg/ml in\nplasma; (14)\n\nFirocoxib: 20 ng/ml in\nplasma; (15)\n\nFlunixin: 5 ng/ml in\nplasma; (16)\n\nFurosemide: 100 ng/ml\nin plasma and a specific gravity of urine less than 1.010; (17)\n\nGlycopyrrolate: 3 pg/ml in\nplasma; (18)\n\nGuaifenesin: 12 ng/ml\nin plasma; (19)\n\nIsoflupredone: 100\npg/ml in plasma; (20)\n\nKetoprofen: 2\nng/ml in plasma; (21)\n\nLidocaine: 20\npg/ml of total 3-hydroxylidocaine in plasma; (22)\n\nMepivacaine: (i) 10 ng/ml of total hydroxymepivacaine in\nurine; or\n(ii)\nany\nhydroxymepivacaine in plasma; (23)\n\nMethocarbamol: 1 ng/ml in\nplasma; (24)\n\nMethylprednisolone: 100 pg/ml in plasma; (25)\n\nOmeprazole: 10 ng/ml of omeprazole sulfide in plasma; (26)\n\nPhenylbutazone: 0.3 mcg/ml in\nplasma; (27)\n\nPrednisolone: 1 ng/ml\nin plasma; (28)\n\nProcaine\npenicillin: 25 ng/ml of procaine in plasma; (29)\n\nRanitidine: 40 ng/ml in\nplasma; (30)\n\nTriamcinolone\nacetonide: 100 pg/ml in plasma; and\n(31)\n\nXylazine: 200 pg/ml in plasma. (b) A laboratory finding that a\nhorse has not exceeded a threshold set forth in this section shall not\nconstitute a defense to a violation of any other section of this\n\nSubchapter. (c) Special provisions. (1)\n\nCobalt. A person who is found responsible\nfor a violation of this section for the substance cobalt, when the detected\nconcentration of cobalt exceeds 300 ng/ml in plasma, shall incur the same\npenalty described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of section\n4043.12\nof this Part. (2)\n\nCorticosteroid joint injection. It shall\nnot be a violation of this section for the drug betamethasone, isoflupredone or\ntriamcinolone acetonide when: (i) the\nlaboratory positive resulted from an administration that was recorded in the\ncontemporaneous veterinary records of the horse, reported to the commission in\ncompliance with subdivision (b) of section\n4043.4\nof this Part before the\nhorse raced, and administered to the horse in compliance with subdivision (i)\nof section\n4043.2\nof this Part at least seven\ndays before the race; and\n(ii)\nthe\ncommission had not previously issued a warning to the trainer that the\ncommission laboratory reported finding such substance, in a urine or blood\nsample collected from any horse trained by such trainer, at a concentration in\nexcess of the threshold set forth in subdivision (a) of this section.
