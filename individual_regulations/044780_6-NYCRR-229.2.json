  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 229.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose\nof this Part, the general definitions of Part 200 of this Title\napply. (b) For the purpose of this\n\nPart, the following definitions also apply: (1)\n\nAnnual. Refers to a period of time based\nupon a calendar year commencing January 1st and terminating midnight December\n31st. (2)\n\nAnnual throughput. The\namount of petroleum or volatile organic liquid transferred into or dispensed\nfrom a defined source or facility during 12 consecutive months. (3)\n\nBarrel. A unit of measurement equal to 42\ngallons. (4)\n\nDaily throughput. The\naverage daily amount of petroleum or volatile organic liquid transferred into\nor dispensed from a defined source or facility. The daily throughput is\ncalculated by dividing the annual throughput by the number of workdays during\nthe 12-month period, which begins on January 1st and ends on December\n31st. (5)\n\nEquivalent control. The\nuse of alternate operational and/or equipment controls that have been approved\nby the commissioner for the reduction of petroleum or volatile organic liquid\nvapor emissions such that the aggregate emissions of petroleum or volatile\norganic liquid vapor from the facility do not exceed those from the application\nof defined reasonably available control technology. (6)\n\nExternal floating roof tank. An open top\ntank with a cover or roof which rests or floats above the petroleum or volatile\norganic liquid in the tank and is equipped with one or more closure seals\nbetween the roof edge and tank wall. (7)\n\nFixed roof storage tank. A petroleum or\nvolatile organic liquid storage vessel consisting of a vertical steel\ncylindrical shell with a permanent affixed roof. (8)\n\nGasoline. Any petroleum distillate having\na Reid vapor pressure of four pounds per square inch (28 kilopascals) or\nhigher, used as a motor fuel. (9)\n\nGasoline bulk plant. A gasoline storage and distribution facility with an\naverage daily throughput of 20,000 gallons of gasoline or less. A gasoline\ndispensing site subject to Part 230 of this Title is not considered to be a\ngasoline bulk plant. (10)\n\nGasoline\nloading terminal. A gasoline storage and distribution facility with an average\ndaily throughput of greater than 20,000 gallons of gasoline. A gasoline\ndispensing site subject to Part 230 of this Title is not considered to be a\ngasoline loading terminal. (11)\n\nGasoline transport vehicle. Any delivery vessel, tank truck, trailer, or\nrailroad tank car, with a capacity of 300 gallons or more, used for the\ntransportation of gasoline. (12)\n\nInternal floating roof tank. A fixed roof tank with a cover or roof which rests\nor floats upon the petroleum or volatile organic liquid in the tank and is\nequipped with one or more closure seals between the roof edge and tank\nwall. (13)\n\nLiquid-mounted seal. A\nprimary seal mounted in continuous contact with the liquid between the tank\nwall and the floating roof around the circumference of the tank. (14)\n\nLower Orange County metropolitan area. The area including the towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury. (15)\n\nMarine delivery vessel. Any vessel which is specifically constructed or\nconverted to transport liquid cargo in tanks, which is designed to move on\nwater, including but not limited to, barges and tankers. This does not include\nwater borne vessels containing only tanks designed to carry liquid necessary\nfor operation of the vessel. (16)\n\nMetallic shoe seal. A petroleum or volatile organic liquid storage vessel seal, which consists of a metal sheet held vertically against the tank wall by\nsprings or weighted levers and is connected by braces to the floating roof. A\nflexible coated fabric spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the\nfloating roof. (17)\n\nPetroleum\nliquid. Any crude oil, condensate, and any finished or intermediate products\nmanufactured or extracted in a petroleum refinery whose true vapor pressure is\nbetween 1.5 and 12 psia (10.5-83 kilopascals) at 70° F. Petroleum liquids do\nnot include Nos. 2 through 6 fuel oils or those volatile organic compounds\nwhich are given an environmental rating of A pursuant to Part 212 of this\n\nTitle. (18)\n\nPotential to emit. The\nmaximum capacity of an air contamination source to emit any air contaminant\nunder its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational\nlimitation on the capacity of the facility or air contamination source to emit\nany air contaminant, including air pollution control equipment and/or\nrestriction on the hours of operation, or on the type or amount of material\ncombusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of the design only if\nthe limitation is contained in enforceable permit conditions. Fugitive\nemissions, to the extent that they are quantifiable, are included in\ndetermining the potential to emit. (19)\n\nStorage tank. Any vessel, reservoir or\ncontainer used for the storage of petroleum and/or volatile organic\nliquids. (20)\n\nTrue vapor pressure. The equilibrium partial pressure exerted by a petroleum or volatile organic\nliquid at 70° F. True vapor pressure of a petroleum or volatile organic liquid\nis to be determined by methods acceptable to the commissioner. The methods\ndescribed in Bulletin 2517 of the American Petroleum Institute (API) are\nconsidered to be acceptable methods for determining true vapor pressure for\npetroleum liquids. (21)\n\nVapor-mounted seal. A primary seal, mounted so there is a ring-shaped vapor\nspace beneath the seal, bounded by the bottom of the primary seal, the tank\nwall, the liquid surface and the floating roof. (22)\n\nVolatile organic liquid. Any organic\nliquid including, but not limited to, liquids that produce vapors which\nparticipate in atmospheric photochemical reactions, or which are measured by an\napplicable test method, but excluding petroleum liquids. The following are not\nconsidered to be volatile organic liquids for the purpose of this regulation: Gasoline, Nos. 2 through 6 fuel oil, commercial and military grades of diesel\nand aviation fuels and those compounds specifically exempted from the\ndefinition of volatile organic compound in Part 200 of this Title.
