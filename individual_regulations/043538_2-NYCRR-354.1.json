  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 354.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection\n500\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw provides that the provisions of article 14 of such law shall apply to all\nmembers of the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System who join\nor rejoin such system on or after July 1, 1976. The pivotal date is now July\n27, 1976, in accordance with the Court of Appeals decision in\n\nCivil\n\nService Employees Association, Inc. et al. v. Regan, 71 NY2d\n653, 529 NYS2d 461. Article 15 of such law was originally intended to\nreplace and supercede article 14 which, by its own terms, purported to provide\nthat it was to expire on August 31, 1983. However, the Court of Appeals has\nheld that the State Constitution protects members of public retirement systems\nwho were subject to the provisions of article 14 from diminution of rights\nprovided thereunder by subsequent legislation, and, accordingly, that the\nprovisions of article 15 may not be constitutionally applied to individuals who\njoined such a public retirement system before the September 1, 1983 effective\ndate of article 15 to the extent that such application would diminish or impair\nrights in and/or benefits from the Retirement System. Accordingly, individuals\nwho last joined the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System\nbetween July 27, 1976 and August 31, 1983 are covered by provisions of both\narticle 14 and article 15. Such individuals are commonly and herein referred to\nas \"Tier 3 members\", whereas individuals who last joined the New York State and\n\nLocal Employees' Retirement System on or after September 1, 1983 are subject to\nthe provisions of article 15 (but not article 14) and are commonly and herein\nreferred to as \"Tier 4\" members. Retirement and Social Security Law sections\n519 (article 14) and 614 (article 15) both provide that individuals who were\nlast enrolled as members prior to the date which, at the time of their\nrespective enactments, was considered to be the last date an individual could\njoin and thereby achieve Tier 2 member status, shall be entitled, upon\nre-enrollment to membership after retirement, to all of the rights and\nprivileges of Tier 2 members. In view of the fact that article 15 was\noriginally intended to replace and supercede article 14 with respect to\nexclusively covering all members who joined the Retirement System after the\nlast date on which they would have been eligible to join as a Tier 2 member, it\nis clear that section 614(b)(i) is best interpreted to require that Tier 3\nmembers who retire and subsequently rejoin the New York State and Local\n\nEmployees' Retirement System be accorded all of the rights and benefits of Tier\n3 membership. This Part is hereby promulgated to so provide. Sections 519 and\n614 further provide that procedural provisions of earlier articles of the\n\nRetirement and Social Security Law regarding reemployment of retired members\nshall apply to members covered by articles 14 and 15. Accordingly, the rules\nprovided herein pertaining to the calculation of benefits upon the retirement\nof restored members are based on the provisions of section 101 to the extent\nthat such provisions are consistent with the provisions of articles 14 and 15. Sections\n517-c\nand\n613-b\nof the Retirement and Social\n\nSecurity Law, which were enacted pursuant to chapter 920 of the Laws of 1990, establish identical programs under which Tier 3 and Tier 4 members of the New\n\nYork State and Local Employees' Retirement System may borrow against their\naccumulated contributions. Neither these sections nor any other provisions of\narticles 14 and 15 expressly provide how benefits should be calculated in\nsituations where a Tier 3 or 4 member retires with an outstanding loan balance, is subsequently restored to membership and later retires with an outstanding\nloan balance from a loan taken prior to the first retirement. Sections 517-c\nand 613-b authorize the Comptroller to promulgate regulations pertaining to the\nadministration of the Tier 3 and Tier 4 loan programs, respectively, and\nsections 519 and 614 authorize the Comptroller to promulgate regulations\npertaining to the administration of the provisions of articles 14 and 15, respectively. In view of the above, this Part is promulgated to provide the\nrules pertaining to restoration of Tier 3 and Tier 4 pensioners and the\nprocedures to be used to calculate benefits upon the subsequent retirement of\n\nTier 3 and Tier 4 pensioners. It also specifically addresses such calculations\nwith respect to restored members who retire with outstanding loan balances from\nloans taken before the first retirement, during post-retirement restoration of\nmembership or both.
