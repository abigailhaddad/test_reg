  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 5-1.47 - Notification and public education requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Notification of results to consumers. All water systems shall provide notice of the individual tap results from lead tap water monitoring carried out under the requirements of section\n5-1.42\nof this Subpart to the persons served by the water system at the specific sampling site from which the sample was taken (\ni.e., the occupants of the residence where the tap was tested). Water systems that exceed the lead action level shall sample the tap water of any customer who requests it in accordance with subdivision (i) of this section. (1)\n\nNotice shall be provided as soon as practical, but no later than 30 days after the system learns of the tap monitoring results. (2)\n\nNotice shall be provided either by mail or by another method approved by the State. (3)\n\nNotice shall include the lead levels for the tap that was tested, an explanation of the health effects of lead, a list of steps consumers can take to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water, and contact information for the water utility. The notice shall also provide the maximum contaminant level goal and the action level for lead and the definitions for these two terms from section\n5-1.72\n(f) of this Subpart. (b) Public education material content and delivery. A water system that exceeds the lead action level based on tap water samples collected in accordance with section\n5-1.42\nof this Subpart shall deliver public education materials in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nContent of public education materials. (i) Community water systems and nontransient noncommunity water systems. Water systems shall include the following elements in printed materials (\ne.g., brochures and pamphlets) in the same order as listed below. In addition, language in clauses (\na\n) through (\nb\n) and (\nf\n) of this subparagraph shall be included in the materials, exactly as written, except for the text in brackets in these clauses for which the water system shall include system-specific information. Any additional information presented by a water system shall be consistent with the information below and be in plain language that can be understood by the general public. Water systems shall submit all written public education materials to the State for approval prior to delivery. (a) IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT LEAD IN YOUR DRINKING WATER. [Insert Name of Water System] found elevated levels of lead in drinking water in some homes/buildings. Lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Please read this information closely to see what you can do to reduce lead in your drinking water. (b) Health effects of lead. Lead can cause serious health problems if too much enters your body from drinking water or other sources. It can cause damage to the brain and kidneys, and can interfere with the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen to all parts of your body. The greatest risk of lead exposure is to infants, young children, and pregnant women. Scientists have linked the effects of lead on the brain with lowered IQ in children. Adults with kidney problems and high blood pressure can be affected by low levels of lead more than healthy adults. Lead is stored in the bones, and it can be released later in life. During pregnancy, the child receives lead from the mother's bones, which may affect brain development. (c) Provide information on sources of lead. (1)\nexplain what lead is; (2)\nexplain possible sources of lead in drinking water and how lead enters drinking water. Include information on home/building plumbing materials and service lines that may contain lead. (3)\ndiscuss other important sources of lead exposure in addition to drinking water (\ne.g., lead-based paint). (d) Discuss the steps consumers can take to reduce their exposure to lead in drinking water: (1)\nencourage running the water to flush out lead; (2)\nexplain concerns with using hot water from the tap and specifically caution against the use of hot water for preparing baby formula; (3)\nexplain that boiling water does not reduce lead levels; (4)\ndiscuss other options consumers can take to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water, such as alternative sources or treatment of water; (5)\nsuggest that parents have their child's blood tested for lead. (e) Explain why there are elevated levels of lead in the system's drinking water (if known) and what the water system is doing to reduce the lead levels in homes/buildings in this area. (f) For more information call us at [Insert Your Number] [(If Applicable), or visit our website at [Insert Your website Here]]. For more information on reducing lead exposure around your home/building and the health effects of lead, visit EPA's website at\nhttp://www.epa.gov/lead\nor contact your health care provider. (ii)\n\nCommunity water systems. In addition to including the elements specified in this paragraph, community water systems shall: (a) tell consumers how to get their water tested; (b) discuss lead in plumbing components, the difference between low lead and lead free, the requirement to use lead-free materials, and the standards that materials shall meet in order to be considered lead free.
