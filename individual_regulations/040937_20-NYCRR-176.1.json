Tit. 20 § 176.1 - Employer's failure to withhold New York State personal income tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 676\n\nIf an employer fails to deduct and withhold New York\n\nState personal income tax, as required by section\n671\nof the Tax Law and this Article, and\nthereafter the New York State income tax against which the New York state\npersonal income tax required to be deducted and withheld may be credited is\npaid, the New York State personal income tax required to be deducted and\nwithheld will not be collected from the employer.

The employer will not be relieved under\nthis provision from his liability for payment of the New York State personal\nincome tax required to be deducted and withheld, unless he can show that the\n\nNew York State income tax against which the New York State personal income tax, required to be deducted and withheld under section\n671\nof the Tax Law and this Article, may be\ncredited has been paid. (See section\n684\nand\n685\nof the Tax Law with regard to\ninterest, additions to tax and civil penalties.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
