  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2204.4 - Proceedings for eviction with certificate\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No tenant who continues to pay the rent\nto which landlord is entitled shall be removed or evicted on grounds other than\nthose stated in section\n2204.2\nof this Part, unless on\napplication of the landlord (provided that where the housing accommodations are\nlocated in a structure or building owned by a two or more persons not\nconstituting a cooperative corporation or association, the application shall be\nconsented to by all the coowners), the administrator shall issue a certificate\npermitting the landlord to pursue his remedies at law at the expiration of the\napplicable waiting period specified in subdivision (b) of this section. The\nadministrator shall issue an order granting a certificate if the removal or\neviction meets the requirements of section\n2204.5, 2204.6, 2204.7, 2204.8\nor\n2204.9\nof this Part. The\nadministrator may also issue orders granting certificates in other cases if the\nrequested removal or eviction is not inconsistent with the purposes of the Rent\n\nLaw or these regulations, and would not be likely to result in the\ncircumvention or evasion thereof, and may impose such terms and conditions, including provisions for relocation and the payment of stipends to the tenants, as the administrator may determine to be necessary or appropriate. (b) (1)\n\nCertificates issued pursuant to these regulations shall authorize the landlord\nto commence proceedings to remove or evict the tenant after the expiration of\nthe applicable waiting period hereinafter specified in this subdivision. Any\nwaiting period prescribed or fixed pursuant to this subdivision shall commence\nupon the date of the issuance of the certificate by the administrator. Except\nas otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the applicable\nwaiting period shall be as follows: (i) where\nrelocation is not required, three months; or\n(ii)\nwhere relocation is required, four\nmonths. (2)\n\nIn any case\nwhere the administrator determines to issue a certificate, and the tenant, because of the provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, is not entitled\nto the benefit of the relocation requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this\nsection, the applicable waiting period with respect to such certificate shall\nbe four months. (3)\n\nWhere the\nadministrator finds (i) that suitable accommodations are available for renting\ninto which the tenant can move without substantial hardship or loss, and (ii)\nthat undue hardship would result to the landlord from delay in acquiring\npossession, the certificate may authorize the landlord to pursue his remedies\nfor removal or eviction of the tenant at the expiration of a period shorter\nthan the minimum waiting period which would otherwise be applicable under the\nforegoing provisions of this subdivision. (c) No certificate (including any certificate\nof eviction issued by the State Rent Commission and enforceable on and after\n\nMay 1, 1962 under the Rent Law) shall be used in connection with any action or\nproceeding to remove or evict a tenant, unless such removal or eviction is\nsought for the purpose specified in the certificate. (d) In the event that the landlord's\nintentions or circumstances have so changed that the premises, possession of\nwhich is sought, will not be used for the purpose specified in any such\ncertificate mentioned in subdivision (c) of this section, such certificate\nshall thereupon be null and void. The landlord shall immediately notify the\ndistrict rent administrator in writing and surrender the certificate for\ncancellation. (e) (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision, whenever compliance with the relocation requirements\nof this section is directed by or required pursuant to these regulations as a\ncondition for the granting of a certificate of eviction, the landlord shall\nprovide suitable relocation for the tenant at the same or lower rent in a\nclosely proximate area, or in a new residential building if constructed on the\nsite, in which case suitable interim housing shall be provided at no additional\ncost to the tenant; plus in addition to reasonable moving expenses, payment of\na $5,000 stipend, provided the tenant vacates on or before the vacate date\nrequired by the final order. (i) In the event\na comparable housing accommodation is offered by the owner, a tenant may file\nan objection with the DHCR challenging the suitability of a housing\naccommodation offered by the owner for relocation with 10 days after the owner\nidentifies the housing accommodation and makes it available for the tenant to\ninspect and consider the suitability thereof. Within 30 days thereafter, the\nDHCR shall inspect the housing accommodation, on notice to both parties, in\norder to determine whether the offered housing accommodation is suitable. Such\ndetermination will be made by as promptly as practicable thereafter. In the\nevent that the DHCR determines that the housing accommodation is not suitable, the tenant shall be offered another housing accommodation, and shall have 10\ndays after it is made available by the owner for the tenant's inspection to\nconsider its suitability. In the event that the DHCR determines that the\nhousing accommodation is suitable, the tenant shall have 15 days thereafter\nwithin which to accept the housing accommodation. A tenant who refuses to\naccept relocation to any housing accommodation determined by the DHCR to be\nsuitable shall lose the right to relocation by the owner, and to receive\npayment of moving expenses or any stipend. 'Suitable housing accommodations'\nshall mean housing accommodations which are similar in size and features to the\nrespective housing accommodations now occupied by the tenant. Such housing\naccommodations shall be freshly painted before the tenant takes occupancy and\nshall be provided with substantially the same essential services and equipment\nthe tenants received in their prior housing accommodations. The building\ncontaining such housing accommodations shall be free from violations of law\nrecorded by the City agency having jurisdiction, which constitute fire hazards\nor conditions dangerous or detrimental to life or health, or which affect the\nmaintenance of essential services. The DHCR will consider housing\naccommodations proposed for relocation which are not presently subject to rent\nregulation, provided the owner submits a contractual agreement that places the\ntenant in a substantially similar housing accommodations at no additional rent\nfor a period of six years, unless the tenant requests a shorter period in\nwriting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause\nwhere a tenant to be relocated is the sole occupant of a rooming house\naccommodation or a single-room occupancy accommodation, an accommodation in a\nlicensed rooming house offered to such tenant may be deemed to be suitable, provided such rooming house accommodation meets the requirements detailed in\nthis section; and\n(a) the tenant's\nability to pay the rent for the offered accommodation. Where an owner provides\nrelocation of a tenant to a suitable housing accommodation at a rent in excess\nof that for the subject housing accommodation, in addition to the tenant's\nreasonable moving expenses, the owner may be required to pay the tenant a\nstipend equal to the difference in rent, at the commencement of the occupancy\nby the tenant of the new housing accommodation, between the subject housing\naccommodation and the housing accommodation to which the tenant is relocated, multiplied by 72 months, provided the tenant vacates on or before the vacate\ndate required by the final order. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding any provision of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision to the contrary, there shall be no relocation\nrequirement where: (i) the tenant is a single\nperson under the age of 60 years who is the sole occupant of a rooming house\naccommodation or a single-room occupancy accommodation, and such occupancy has\ncontinued for less than six months prior to the date of the filing of the\napplication for a certificate of eviction; (ii)\nthe tenant's housing accommodation is\noccupied by three persons or less and the maximum monthly rent therefor, as of\n\nJanuary 1, 1961, was $200 or more; or\n(iii)\nthe tenant's housing accommodation is\noccupied by four persons or more and the maximum monthly rent therefor, as of\n\nJanuary 1, 1961, was $ 250 or more. (3)\n\nWhenever compliance with the stipend\nrequirements of this section is directed by or required pursuant to these\nregulations, the landlord shall pay the applicable stipend hereinafter provided\nfor in this paragraph to each tenant who moves or rents another accommodation\nafter the date of the filing of the application, and prior to the withdrawal or\nfinal denial of such application, and such payment shall be made within five\ndays from the date of the tenant's removal. The payment of such stipend shall\nbe made on the basis of the following schedule: (i) For other than rooming house tenants or\nsingle room occupants (except as provided in subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of\nthis paragraph): in addition to the tenant's moving expenses, pay the tenant a\nstipend which shall be the difference between the tenant's current rent and the\naverage rent for vacant non-regulated apartments as set forth in the New York\n\nCity Housing Vacancy Survey as of the date of the determination. This\ndifference is to be multiplied by 72 months. The stipend shall be increased\neach year by the guideline adjustment as set forth by the New York City Rent\n\nGuidelines Board for a one year lease beginning the first year after the\nvacancy report is issued and continuing until a new vacancy report is issued. (4)\n\nWhere a housing\naccommodation is occupied by more than one tenant, the stipend required to be\npaid pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall be paid to each tenant\nin proportion to the space personally occupied by him and members of his\nhousehold. (5)\n\nWhere a housing\naccommodation is sublet, the stipend or stipends required to be paid pursuant\nto paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall be allocated between the prime\ntenant and the subtenants, on such basis as the administrator shall determine\nto be appropriate, with due regard for such factors as space personally\noccupied by the prime tenant and the subtenants and the duration of the\nunexpired term of the subtenants' tenancy. (6)\n\nWherever a stipend would result in the\ntenant losing a subsidy or other government benefit which is income dependent, the tenant may elect to waive the stipend and have the owner at his or her own\nexpense, relocate the tenant to a suitable housing accommodation at the same or\nlower legal regulated rent in a closely proximate area. (7)\n\nIn the event that the tenant dies prior\nto the issuance by the DHCR of a final order granting the owner's application, the owner shall not be required to pay such stipend to the estate of the\ndeceased tenant. (f) Whenever compliance with stipend requirements of this section is directed by or\npursuant to these regulations, the landlord shall deposit in escrow with his\nattorney a sum of money sufficient to pay the prescribed stipend to: (1)\neach tenant in the building or structure\nwho is still in occupancy on the 10th day prior to the expiration of the\napplicable waiting period; and\n(2)\neach tenant who had previously vacated after the application was filed by the\nlandlord and who has not already received payment of the stipend. The escrow deposit shall be conditioned upon the payment\nof the stipend within five days from demand for payment after the tenant's\nremoval from the premises. Proof of payment of the applicable stipends and/or\ncompliance with the requirements of the foregoing provisions of this\nsubdivision shall be filed no later than five days before the expiration of the\nwaiting period. (g) No application for a certificate of\neviction shall be granted under sections\n2204.7, 2204.8\nand\n2204.9\n(a)(2) and\n(4)\nof this Part, unless the administrator\ndetermines, after a hearing, that: (1)\nthere\nis no reasonable possibility that the landlord can make a net annual return of\n8 1/2 percent of the assessed valuation of the subject property without\nrecourse to the eviction sought; and\n(2)\nneither the landlord nor immediate\npredecessor in interest has intentionally or willfully managed the property to\nimpair the landlord's ability to earn such return. (h) The effectiveness of any certificate of\neviction or of any order granting a certificate of eviction pursuant to\nsections\n2204.7, 2204.8\nand\n2204.9\n(a)(2) and\n(4)\nof this Part, shall be suspended, and no\ntenant may be evicted pursuant to such certificate or order, unless and until\nthe requirements of subdivision (g) of this section have been complied with and\nthe commissioner issues an order reinstating the effectiveness of any\ncertificate of eviction or any order granting a certificate of eviction\nsuspended by chapter 1022 of the Laws of 1974, as amended by chapter 360 of the\n\nLaws of 1975. The relief granted in this subdivision shall take effect\nnotwithstanding the pendency of any judicial proceeding or appeal. (i) The provisions of subdivisions (g) and\n(h) of this section shall not apply to an application under section\n2204.7\nor\n2204.8\nof this Part where the\nalteration, remodeling or construction of a new building is to be aided by\ninterest reduction payments under section 236 of the National Housing\n\nAct. (j) The provisions of this\nsection shall apply to all certificates of eviction issued pursuant to these\nregulations, unless otherwise specified. (k) Where the administrator's order granting\nthe owner's application is conditioned upon the owner's compliance with\nspecified terms and conditions, if such terms and conditions have not been\ncomplied with, or if DHCR determines that the owner has not proceeded in good\nfaith, the order may be modified or revoked. (l) Noncompliance by an owner with any term\nor condition of the administrator's order granting the owner's application may\nresult in DHCR initiating its own enforcement proceeding. The DHCR shall retain\njurisdiction for this purpose until all of the terms and conditions in the\nadministrator's order granting the owner's application have been met and the\nproject described in the owner's application has been completed. Subsequent\nowners shall be bound by the terms and conditions of DHCR's order. This clause\nshall not be deemed to eliminate any remedy or claim that a tenant of the\ndwelling unit may otherwise have against the owner nor eliminate any\nindependent authority that DHCR may be able to exercise by law or\nregulation. (m) An owner's failure\nto comply within a reasonable time with any term or condition of the\nadministrator's order granting the owner's application or an owner's failure to\ncomplete the project described in the owner's application may be found to be a\nviolation of the Administrative Code of the City of New York and the City Rent\nand Evictions Regulations and subject to any of the penalties and remedies\ndescribed therein including but not limited to revocation of the\nadministrator's order granting the owner's application and DHCR's continued\njurisdiction under the Administrative Code of the City of New York over the\nbuilding or any subsequent construction. Any remedies and penalties prescribed\nby this Code shall apply to and be binding against subsequent owners. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
