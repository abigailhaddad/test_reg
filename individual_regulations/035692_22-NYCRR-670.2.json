(1)\nA stipulation\nwithdrawing an appeal or proceeding which has been placed on the court's\ncalendar must be filed with the court prior to the calendar date. Absent such a\nstipulation, an appellant may, prior to the calendar date, move for permission\nto withdraw such an appeal or proceeding. (2)\n\nAn appeal which has been placed on the\ncourt's calendar cannot subsequently be withdrawn based upon a settlement which\noccurred prior to the calendar date, except upon a showing of good\ncause. (3)\n\nAn application for\npermission to withdraw an appeal subsequent to the calendar date must be\nsupported by: (i) a stipulation withdrawing\nthe appeal; (ii)\ndocumentation\nwhich establishes when the event upon which the withdrawal is based occurred; and\n(iii)\nwhere appropriate, an\nexplanation regarding why there was a delay in notifying the court of that\nevent. Such applications shall be granted only in limited circumstances and\nupon a showing of good cause. (b) Notice of change of\ncircumstances. For the purposes of the Practice Rules of the\n\nAppellate Division (22 NYCRR section\n1250.2\n[c]\n), settlement includes, but is not limited to, any oral or written agreement or\nunderstanding which may, once memorialized, render a determination of the cause\nunnecessary.
