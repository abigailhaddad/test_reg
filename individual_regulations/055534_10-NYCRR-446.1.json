  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 446.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Public Law\n95-142, section 19, requires that for the purposes of reporting the cost of\nservices provided by, of planning and of measuring and comparing the efficiency\nof and effective use of services in, hospitals, the Secretary of Health and\n\nHuman Services shall establish by regulation a uniform system for reporting\ncertain types of information. It further states that in reporting under such a\nsystem, hospitals shall employ such chart of accounts, definitions, principles\nand statistics as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may prescribe in\norder to reach a uniform reconciliation of financial and statistical data for\nspecified uniform reports to the Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices. (b) First, hospitals must\nfollow a set of uniform reporting policies and practices as specified in Part\n442 of this Article. Items such as methods of capitalization and depreciation\nof assets and direct charging of medical supplies and payroll-related employee\nbenefits to using centers are examples of important policies which must be\nfollowed for reporting purposes. When these policies differ from those of the\nhospital, reconciliations must be made to reflect the required policies in\ncompleting the uniform financial report. (c) Secondly, the principles and concepts\nutilized in the preparation of the uniform financial report will be based upon\na portrayal of the hospital's activities on a functional basis regardless of\nthird-party reimbursement policies. The uniform financial report described in\nthis Manual has been designed to flow directly into the Federal cost reports\nrequired for Titles 18 and 19 where the functional trial balance of expenses is\nsubject to grouping, reclassification and adjustment as the data moves to the\nreimbursement worksheets. (d) The\nthird key principle affecting the preparation of the uniform financial report\nis the requirement that costs will be measured at a level where uniformity can\nbe obtained and a standard output measurement applied. For purposes of\nreporting, it was determined that standard units of measure would be applied to\ncost centers. Therefore, for uniform functional reporting of revenue and\nexpense there may be a need for reclassification to convert revenue or costs\nfrom the responsibility reporting format to a functional reporting\nformat. (e) Responsibility\nreporting is defined as the reporting of costs according to organizational\nunits such as departments. (f) Functional reporting is defined as the reporting of costs according to type of\nactivity. (g) Total costs are the\nsame with either functional or responsibility reporting. However, because\norganization structures vary among hospitals, responsibility reporting does not\nallow the comparability necessary for reasonable evaluation. Therefore, the\nreporting system for hospitals was developed to allow comparable reporting of\nhospital costs while hospitals maintain responsibility accounting systems if\nthey so desire. (h) Hospitals are\nrequired to report: (1)\nhospital profile\ndata--data identifying the control, type, services offered, certification(s), programs, coverage, etc. of the facility; (2)\nassets, liabilities and equity--all\nbalance sheet accounts whose titles are capitalized in the listing of accounts\nand whose numerical code ends in \"0\" when such assets, liabilities and equity\nexist (and certain subaccounts as noted in section\n446.8\nof this Part); (3)\ndaily hospital services--all revenue and\nexpense centers whose titles are capitalized in the listing of accounts and\nwhose numerical code ends in \"0\" when such revenue centers and cost centers\nexist and are located in a discrete unit of the facility (and certain\nsubaccounts as noted in section\n446.9\nof this Part). A discrete\nunit is a separately organized, staffed and equipped unit of the\nfacility; (4)\nwhere two or more\ndaily hospital services, as defined in Part 444 of this Article, are provided\nin the same unit, the revenue and expense applicable to that unit must be\nreported in the functional revenue and cost centers which best describe the\nprincipal patient service provided in the combined unit. For example, assume\nthat a hospital maintains a combined acute care unit which provides\nmedical/surgical, pediatric and obstetrics acute care. Also assume that\nprincipal patient care service provided in this unit is medical/surgical acute\ncare. The hospital in this situation will report the revenue and expense\napplicable to this unit as being medical/surgical acute care. Furthermore, the\nhospital, when completing the Services Inventory Worksheet, will indicate that\n\nPediatric Acute Care and Obstetrics Acute Care are being reported as\nmedical/surgical acute care in the reporting forms by entering the\n\nMedical/Surgical Acute account number; (5)\nall other revenue centers and cost\ncenters--all other revenue centers and cost centers whose titles are\ncapitalized in the listing of accounts and whose numerical code ends in \"0\"\nwhen the services or function exists or is performed in the hospital, irrespective of whether or not it is a discrete unit (and certain subaccounts\nas noted in section\n446.9\nof this Part); (6)\nunits of measure--the required standard\nunit of measure must be accumulated and reported for all expense centers\nindicated in Part 444 of this Article; (7)\nnatural classification of expense--all\nnatural classifications of expense, except salaries and wages, whose numerical\ncode ends in \"0\". All of the salaries and wages sub-natural classifications\ne.g.,.01 Management and Supervision, 02 Technician and Specialist,.03\n\nRegistered Nurse, etc.) must be reported for each functional cost center, as\nappropriate; (8)\nother supplemental\nreimbursement reporting--for other third-party reimbursement as described in\nsections 446.7 through\n446.44\nof this Part. (i) All data reported must be\npresented in accordance with the listing of accounts and definitions, identified in other parts of this Manual. No line or column description may be\nchanged under any circumstances, unless an exception has been granted. For\n\nMedicare purposes only, substitute cost reporting forms may be used. All\nsubstitute cost reporting forms must be identical in all respects to the Health\n\nCare Financing Administration (HCFA) forms, including designation by some\ndistinctive symbol or character of those areas which are shaded on the official\nHCFA forms. Substitute cost reporting forms may be accepted for use in lieu of\nthe official HCFA forms, subject to review and acceptance by HCFA. HCFA will\nalso accept the report in machine-readable media subject to the specifications\nto be prescribed by HCFA at a later date. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
