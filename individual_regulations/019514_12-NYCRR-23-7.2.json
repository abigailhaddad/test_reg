  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-7.2 - Temporary personnel or workmen's hoists\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Approval required. Temporary personnel\nhoists shall not be placed in service until each such installation has been\ngranted a special approval. The requirements of any such approval shall be\napplied in conjunction with all other requirements of this section. (b) Hoist towers. (1)\n\nEvery hoist tower used for a temporary\npersonnel hoist shall be supported by a firm foundation of such dimensions as\nto adequately distribute the transmitted load so as not to exceed the safe\nload-bearing capacity of the ground upon which such tower is erected. Each such\nhoist tower shall be securely braced to the building or other structure so that\nsuch tower is held in a plumb vertical position, is stable, rigid and able to\nwithstand wind pressure. (2)\n\nEach\nsuch hoist tower shall be secured with guys or rigid braces at each corner at\nintervals not to exceed 26 feet vertically. Tower guys shall be at least\none-half inch diameter improved plow steel wire rope and shall be securely\nfastened to adequate anchorages with wire rope clips as specified in Table XVI\nof Subpart 23-6 of this Part (rule). All building tie-ins shall be identified\nby metal tags bearing the legend: \"WORKMEN'S HOIST--DO NOT REMOVE\". (3)\n\nHoist towers shall be erected and\ndismantled only under the direct supervision of qualified, designated\npersons. (4)\n\nHoist towers shall be\nerected only to heights necessary for the performance of the work and shall be\nextended in height only when construction has progressed sufficiently in height\nin order to provide for the adequate anchorages and bracing required by this\n\nSubpart unless other safe and adequate guying can be provided. (c) Hoistway enclosures. (1)\n\nInterior. Interior hoistways for\ntemporary personnel hoists shall be fully enclosed at every floor except for\nentrance openings. Such enclosures shall be constructed of wire mesh of not\nless than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings which will reject a one-half\ninch diameter ball or such enclosures shall be partitions of exterior grade\nplywood at least three-eighths inch thick, of wood slats not less than\nthree-quarters inch thick installed horizontally and spaced not more than two\ninches apart or of other material of equivalent strength. Such enclosures shall\nbe adequately supported, braced and secured. (2)\n\nEnclosed exterior. When exterior\nhoistways for personnel hoists are enclosed, such enclosures shall extend from\nthe lowest terminal points to the cathead elevations on all sides except\nentrance openings. Such enclosures shall be constructed of wire mesh of not\nless than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings which will reject a one-half\ninch diameter ball. (3)\n\nUnenclosed\nexterior. When exterior hoistways for personnel hoists are unenclosed, the\nfollowing requirements shall apply: (i) Every\nsuch hoistway shall be enclosed at the ground or grade level to a height of at\nleast 10 feet on all sides except entrance openings. Such enclosures shall be\nconstructed of wire mesh of not less than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings\nwhich will reject a one-half inch diameter ball. The entrance openings of such\nhoistways shall be guarded in compliance with this section. (ii)\n\nWhere any point on a moving car or\ncounterweight passes less than eight feet from a floor, scaffold platform or\nother work surface or position, such floor, scaffold platform or other work\nsurface so exposed shall be provided with a partition at least six feet in\nheight. Such partition shall extend horizontally at least five feet past the\nhorizontal project of the path of the car or counterweight. Such partition\nshall be at least equal in construction to hoistway enclosures as specified in\nthis section. (4)\n\nRunning clearances. Every hoistway enclosure shall be so installed and\nreinforced in all areas subject to external pressure that the running\nclearances between car and enclosure cannot be reduced to less than one inch\nupon the application of any horizontal pressure of 100 pounds against any point\non such enclosure. (d) Hoistway doors. (1)\n\nEvery entrance opening in\nany hoistway enclosure for a personnel hoist shall be provided with a solid\ndoor at least 78 inches in height which shall extend across the full width of\nthe opening. Such door shall be provided with a vision panel securely covered\nwith wire mesh. Such door shall be provided with a lock or latch which is\nopenable from the hoistway side only and inaccessible from the landing side. Every such door shall have an underclearance of not more than one-half inch. Exception:Such entrance door at the lowest landing of any\nhoistway shall be provided with a means, accessible only to designated persons, for unlocking the door from the landing side. (2)\n\nIn normal service every hoistway door\nshall be locked or latched shut except when in use for passage to or from the\ncar. No person except the car attendant shall open any such door. (3)\n\nHoistway entrance doors shall be hung to\nprovide durability and shall be securely reinforced. (e) Car enclosures. The car of every\npersonnel hoist shall be permanently enclosed on all sides and the top except\nthe side used for entrance or exit. Such enclosure shall be equivalent in\nstrength to two-inch planking laid tight. The top of every such enclosure shall\nbe provided with an emergency exit opening fitted with a hinged hatch cover. Such exit opening shall be not less than 16 inches in its smallest dimension\nand not less than 400 square inches in area. (f) Car doors or gates. (1)\n\nEach landing side of any car used in a\npersonnel hoist shall be provided with a door or gate at least six feet in\nheight constructed of material at least as equivalent in strength as the car\nenclosure. (2)\n\nEvery opening in\nsuch door or gate shall be of such size and shape as to reject a three- inch\ndiameter ball at any point. (3)\n\nEvery such car shall be equipped with an approved electrical contact so\narranged that the car cannot be operated unless each door or gate is\nshut. (g) Wiring. Wiring\nand other electrical equipment shall be of proper quality and properly\ninstalled. Electrical installations shall be in accordance with the 1971\n\nNational Electrical Code. Hoistway wiring may consist of heavy-duty\nrubber-covered traveling cable. All wiring and other electrical equipment\nexposed to the elements shall be weatherproof. (h) Lighting.
