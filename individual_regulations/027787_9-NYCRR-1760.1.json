Tit. 9 § 1760.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nWith the consent of the division, a housing company may\nsatisfy its existing mortgage and enter into a new State-aided or private\nmortgage, and thereafter continue under the Mitchell-Lama program. Such\nrefinance may be in connection with a redevelopment plan under which the\nhousing company enters into multiple regulatory agreements with the division\nand other agencies under a variety of subsidy programs to raise capital for\nrehabilitation work and to help maintain the premises as safe, decent, and\naffordable housing. When a refinancing is part of a redevelopment plan that\ninvolves more than one governmental agency with supervisory authority, some of\nthe requirements of this Part may be eliminated pursuant to section\n1700.6\nof this\n\nChapter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n1760.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
