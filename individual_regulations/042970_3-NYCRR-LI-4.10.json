  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.10 - Payment of dividends upon conversion from a regular to a day of deposit-day of withdrawal account\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department's opinion was requested as to whether\ndividends could be paid by a savings bank from the beginning of the regular\ndividend period in the event a regular savings account is converted to a Day of\n\nDeposit-Day of Withdrawal account in mid-dividend period. Section 245(3)(c) provides that a savings bank shall\nnot\n\"Declare any dividend on any deposit for a longer period than\nthe same has been on deposit or on any deposit withdrawn before the end of a\ndividend period, except as provided in subdivisions three-a and three-b of this\nsection... \"\nAlso, section 245 (3-a) provides that if funds are withdrawn\nfrom a regular savings account before the end of a dividend period, dividends\nfor the time during which the funds were on deposit may be paid in two\ncircumstances: If the withdrawal is made during the \"grace days\" --the last\nthree business days of any business period or the last four if one of the last\nthree days is a Saturday. If the by-laws so provide, dividends may be paid at the rate\nof the last dividend to the first day of the month during which the withdrawal\nis made. The preceding provisions indicate clearly that the only\ndividends which may be paid are those which are mandated or permitted by\nstatute. No provision exists for the payment of dividends on a regular account\nbetween the quarterly dividend date and the date of withdrawal other than as\nprovided in section 245 (3-a). Even though funds transferred from a regular to\na DOD/DOW account remain in the bank at all times, in fact and according to\nlaw, two transactions occur: a withdrawal is made from the regular account and\na deposit is then made into a DOD/DOW account. Accordingly, the department concluded there is no provision\nof law to permit a bank to treat the withdrawal from the regular account any\ndifferently from any other withdrawal from a regular account which is not\nfollowed by a deposit into a DOD/DOW account. However, the department expressed\nthe hope that savings banks would not encourage transfers which result in the\nloss of dividends to the depositor. The department also expressed the opinion that under section\n378\nof the Banking\n\nLaw as amended by chapter 704 of the Laws of 1974, a result opposite to the\nforegoing would be correct in the case of accounts with savings and loan\nassociations.
