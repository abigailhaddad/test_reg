  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 12.1 - Complaints and questions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Filing. Any\nutility customer may file a complaint with, or ask a question of, the\ncommission relating to his or her electric, gas, steam, telephone or water\nservice, when the customer believes he or she has not obtained a satisfactory\nresolution of a dispute with a utility regulated by the commission. Complaints\nmay involve bills for utility service, deposit requests, negotiations for\ndeferred payment agreements, service problems, and other matters relating to\nutility service. (b) Department\noffices. A complaint or question may be filed by telephone, letter, electronically, or in person at the commission's office in New York City, Albany or Buffalo. (c) Complaint\nsubmissions. Once a customer has filed a complaint and provided basic\ninformation to the commission's Office of Consumer Services so the complaint\ncan be investigated, the utility will be notified of the complaint and will be\nrequired to submit information regarding the merits of the complaint. This\nsubmission should explain its actions in the disputed matter and the extent to\nwhich those actions were consistent with the utility's procedures and tariff, commission rules, regulations, orders and opinions, and applicable State laws. The utility may be required by staff to provide copies of bills, billing\nstatements, field reports, written documents, or other information in the\npossession of the utility which may be necessary to make a decision on the\ncomplaint. A customer making a complaint is responsible for providing staff\nwith any facts that he or she possesses in support of his or her\nposition. (d) Inspections and\ntests. Should staff determine that an onsite inspection or test is required, he\nor she may order a test or inspection. This work may be done by staff and/or by\nutility staff at the direction of commission staff, depending on the nature of\nthe complaint, time considerations and staff availability. (e) Investigation. Staff will investigate\neach complaint or question and will respond to the customer, or, if possible, suggest the name, address and/or telephone number of a person or agency who\nmight be able to respond.
