Requests should be addressed to: Records Access Officer, New\n\nYork State Council on the Arts, 80 Centre Street, New York, New York 10013. Applications for inspection of records may also be made in person to the\nrecords access officer at the council's offices at 80 Centre Street, New York, New York 10013, during regular working hours on each business day the council\nis open to the public. In such instances, applicants will be required to\nfurnish a written request for records, which may be on a form provided by the\nrecords access officer, listing the records requested.
