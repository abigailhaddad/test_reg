  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 165.11 - Structural integrity evaluation\n\nState Regulations\nA structural integrity evaluation is a detailed structural\nand foundation evaluation and analysis. Used in conjunction with an inspection, it details a bridge's structural condition and integrity as well as present and\nfuture needs to preserve or upgrade the safety and serviceability of the\nbridge. The scope of a structural integrity evaluation shall include, where\napplicable to the determination of integrity and safety, the following: (a) A review, where available and reasonably\nretrievable and consistent with engineering practice to perform such an\nevaluation, of the design, design as- built plans, contract documents, and\nhistory of construction, structural alterations, rehabilitation, and\nmaintenance repairs. (b) A review\nof design code changes since the time of original design with emphasis on the\nimpact the original design assumptions have on the bridge's structural\nintegrity and safety in comparison with current standards and\npractices. (c) A level 1 load\nrating as defined by section\n165.8\nof this Part. (d) For bridges over water, an evaluation of\nthe effect of relevant or anticipated stream changes, as well as an evaluation\nof the effects of hydraulic flows, including design flood conditions. The\n\nFederal Technical Advisory (Code T 5140.20) titled Scour at Bridges published\nby the Federal Highway Administration may serve as a guide for evaluating\nbridges for scour vulnerability. (e) An evaluation of the effects of\ndeterioration and modification to the original structure on structural\nintegrity, in conjunction with a general inspection conforming to the\nrequirements of this Code. (f) A\nlife cycle projection of the scope and estimated cost of maintenance, repair, and/or rehabilitation needed to preserve or upgrade the structural integrity\nand safety of the bridge, in order to provide criteria for comprehensive bridge\nmanagement and safety. Structural integrity evaluations shall be documented in a\ndetailed report format and shall be signed by a qualified structural integrity\nevaluation engineer as defined by Section\n165.5\n(b)(4)\nof\nthis Part. Two copies of the structural integrity evaluation report shall be\nfiled with the New York State Department of Transportation regional office in\nwhich the bridge is located. One copy of the report shall be made available to\nthe bridge inspector as a reference for all subsequent general bridge\ninspections. Whenever a structural integrity and safety rating indicates a high\nvulnerability to structural failure a structural integrity evaluation shall be\nperformed. Specific criteria for requiring a structural integrity evaluation to\nbe performed based on the New York State Department of Transportation\nstructural integrity and safety rating system are described in the New York\n\nState Department of Transportation Structural Integrity and Safety Rating\n\nGuide. In cases where a bridge meets the criteria for requiring a structural\nintegrity evaluation, but already has such an evaluation on file, a repeat\nevaluation is not required unless it is determined that the evaluation on file\nis no longer appropriate for the bridge in question. A recommendation of\nappropriateness shall be made and documented by the bridge inspection team\nleader based on a review of the report as part of performing a general bridge\ninspection. In cases where only portions of the report are no longer\nappropriate, amendments to the original structural integrity evaluation report\nmay be produced. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n165.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
