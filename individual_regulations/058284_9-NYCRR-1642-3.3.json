  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.3 - Cash disbursements-voucher register\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The entries in this register shall be\nrestricted to such obligations as have been audited internally and approved by\nthe local agency. A separate cash disbursement-voucher register shall be\nmaintained for each general ledger. The source of each entry shall be an\naccounts payable voucher (see §\n1642-2.4\n). Each voucher shall be\nentered on a separate line in consecutive numerical order. All checks shall be\nrecorded in the cash disbursements-voucher register concurrently with the\nissuance thereof. A separate column shall be used for each bank account. Each\ncheck issued shall be entered in consecutive numerical order, as far as\npossible. Each voucher shall have the check or checks issued entered on the\ncorresponding line or lines in the register. Bank debits shall be entered in\nthe register and the appropriate account charged through the\nregister. (b) The cash\ndisbursements-voucher register is closed and ruled off at the end of each\nmonth. Entries made in the general ledger columns shall be posted to the\ngeneral ledger individually and currently. Entries made in the other columns\nare posted, in total, at the end of each month to the respective general ledger\nand subsidiary ledger accounts. A specimen cash disbursements-voucher register\nfor a single development project is shown as Exhibit 4 or 5 of Appendix S-8. Exhibit 6 of Appendix S-8 illustrates the expansion of the single development\nregister to provide for the situation where accounts are maintained in the\nsubsidiary ledger to control each of the major subgroups of development costs\nand/or expenses. The use of single or multiple controls is optional with the\nlocal agency. The instructions herein with respect to the specimen form of cash\ndisbursements-voucher register for a single development project (Exhibit 4 and\n5) also apply in principle to Exhibit 6, the specimen form for a multiple\ndevelopment project. The specimen form of the cash disbursements-voucher\nregister for a multiple development project reflects separate accountability\nfor the costs, expenses and revenues of each of the sites included in a\nmultiple development project. Separate accountability for such sites is, however, not mandatory, unless the division so directs the local\nagency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
