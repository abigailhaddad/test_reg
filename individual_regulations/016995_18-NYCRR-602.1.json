  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 602.1 - Allocation principles\n\nState Regulations\n\nCosts subject to reimbursement from more than one program\nor activity must be allocated or distributed by social services districts among\nthe various classifications for which reimbursement may be claimed in a manner\nthat reasonably assigns to each appropriate classification that portion of the\ncosts for which reimbursement is sought. (a) Districts must adhere to the cost\nallocation principles prescribed by the department. (b) Except as otherwise directed by the\ndepartment, social services districts must adhere to the cost allocation\nprinciples to which the department is subject as a condition of obtaining\nreimbursement from entities other than the department. (c) Cost allocation plans must be utilized\nwhen required or applicable. (d) Except as otherwise required by an established or approved cost allocation\nplan, costs will be charged to the most specific groups of classifications or\npools that are applicable to the allocated cost. (e) Costs derived from general groups of\nclassifications or pools must be distributed to less general groups or pools\nbefore costs are derived and distributed to specific classifications or\npools. (f) Costs may not be derived\nand distributed from any group of classifications or pools before the charges\nor adjustments required for correct calculations of derivations are attributed\nto that pool. (g) Administrative\ncosts are subject to allocation unless such costs can be charged to a specific\nclassification or can be subdivided directly to more than one specific\nclassification without allocation. (h) Groups of classifications or functions\nestablished by the department for coding of payroll and nonsalary expenditures\nmust be used by a district when distributing costs for the purpose of\nsubmitting a claim for reimbursement to the department. (i) Directions of the department may be\ncountermanded only by a subsequent express direction made by an agent of the\ndepartment authorized to make such direction for the department. Directions\nwill not be presumed to be subject to revision by any order or direction other\nthan by the department. However, any district which is ordered by a court or a\n\nFederal authority to take action in contravention of these regulations must\nnotify the department's general counsel orally as soon as possible of such\norder and confirm such notification in writing. Such notification and\nconfirmation must recite the obligation under this subdivision which is being\nfulfilled. The district's notification must include, where necessary and\nappropriate, a statement of how the district intends to comply with the order. Such compliance will thereafter constitute compliance with department direction\nunless the general counsel or other authorized officer of the department\nspecifically directs otherwise. The department direction becomes a final\ndetermination not subject to administrative review when a claim or a portion of\na claim subject to the direction is adjudicated in accordance with the\nprovisions of section 604.1 of this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n602.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
