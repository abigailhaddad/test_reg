(b) The\nsupply of water through separate service must be recorded by one meter only. If\nadditional meters are desired for recording the subdivision of such supply, they must be furnished and set by the owners or users at their own expense. Furthermore, the water board shall not be required to read such meters nor to\nsubdivide water bills in view of the existence of such subdividing\nmeters. (c) All water meters\ninstalled after August 1, 1988, including remote reading devices, shall be\npurchased by the water board and shall remain the property of the water board. All costs of inspection, testing and installation, where applicable, shall be\nborne by the water board and shall be recovered through the establishment of\nequitable rates and charges for water service. (d) Water meters shall not be removed from\none service to another except by the water board. The water board reserves the\nright to remove and replace any meter at the director's determination. Meters\nshall be tested and repaired as necessary by the water board. (e) Water meters less than two inches in size\nshall be placed inside the basement wall or indoors whenever possible. When it\nis necessary to install a water meter in any other location, a water control\nstructure of such size and construction as is approved by the director must be\nprovided and paid for by the owner of the property served thereby. (f) Water meters less than two inches in size\nshall be installed by the water board only, and the cost of such installation\nshall be borne by the water board. A place must be provided by the owner where\nsuch meters and remote reading devices will be protected from frost and other\ndamage and in readily accessible locations for reading, examination, repair and\nremoval. A brass \"stop and waste\" type valve must be provided just ahead of, and on the supply side of the meter. (g) Unless otherwise permitted by the\ndirector, meters of two-inch size or larger must be placed inside a building or\nin a water control structure of such design and dimensions, and at such a\nlocation, as is approved by the director. Meter assemblies must be protected\nfrom frost and other damage, and be readily accessible for reading, examination, testing, repair and removal. The property owner is responsible for\nthe construction or modification of all required structures, piping, and\nappurtenances, including the provision of approved backflow prevention, required by the water board. The water meter shall be provided by the water\nboard and shall remain the property of the water board. (h) Installation or replacement of water\nmeters two inches in size or larger shall be performed at the water board's\noption, either by the water board at real cost to the property owner, or by the\nproperty owner or his contractor subject to all requirements of the water\nboard. (i) All water meters two\ninches in size or larger must be provided with a suitable by-pass of such size\nas will provide a continuous supply of water during such time as the water\nmeter is undergoing repairs, testing or replacement. The property owner shall\nbe billed for meter testing with the first water bill rendered after the date\nof such test. (j) A suitable check\nand relief valve may be required by the director in the service pipe after the\nmeter, at the property owner's expense, when there is a possibility of hot\nwater backing up into the water meter. (k) Each application for a water or fire\nservice which is two inches in size or larger must be accompanied by five\ncopies of a detailed dimensional plan, drawn to scale, and acceptable to the\ndirector, which must show the exact manner of installation of the service, including an acceptable backflow prevention device, and the water meter, if\napplicable. (l) The director is\nhereby authorized to make such determinations or interpretations of these\nregulations and specifications regarding the installation of water meters as\nare deemed necessary by the director. Prints of the standard type of water\ncontrol structure installations and by-passes acceptable to the water board are\navailable upon request. (m) Whenever\na service is to interconnect in any manner with any other supply of water, a\nseparate detail of such interconnection must be clearly shown. Such\ninterconnection must comply with requirements of the State Department of Health\n\nSanitary Code. The application for any interconnected service as heretofore\ndescribed shall not be granted nor any connection made to any water main until\nthe plan of installation has been approved by the director, the Niagara County\n\nHealth Department, and the State Department of Health. (n) All water meters and by-pass valves shall\nbe sealed by the water board when they are placed in service. Such seals shall\nnot be removed except by the water board unless permission is first obtained in\nwriting from the director.

(o) It\nshall be the duty of the property owner to report to the water board any broken\nor missing seals, including meter seals. If the director determines that the\nseal was broken accidentally, then the water board shall set a new seal, without charge or other enforcement action. (p) The water board reserves the right to\nenter, at any reasonable time, and with reasonable notice, any premises where a\nwater meter is installed, for the purpose of testing, examining, repairing, removing, replacing or modifying such meter and its appurtenances when, in the\nopinion of the director, such action is necessary. (q) The water board shall repair, without\ncost to the property owner, any water board-owned water meter located on a\nwater service within the city corporate limits, provided that such meter has\nnot been damaged by freezing, hot water or other act or omission by the\nproperty owner. If the property owner or his agent, employees, or tenants are\ndetermined to be responsible for damages by the director, then the real cost of\nrepairing or replacing the water meter and/or remote reading device shall be\nborne by said property owner. (r) Water meters may be tested by the water board periodically. The costs of all\nsuch testing shall be borne by the water board. (s) A meter may be tested at the request of a\nproperty owner without charge if the test reveals that the meter is not within\nthe limits of accuracy as determined by the director. The director may rely\nupon the standards of the American Water Works Association or such other\nsimilar standards as he or she deems appropriate. For a water meter less than\ntwo inches in size, a small meter testing fee as identified in the board\nschedule of rates will be charged if the meter is found to be within the limits\nof accuracy. For meters two inches in size or larger, the real cost of\nrequested testing shall be paid by the property owner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
