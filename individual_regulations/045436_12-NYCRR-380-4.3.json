The first time an employee requests leave because of a\nqualifying exigency arising out of the covered active duty or call to covered\nactive duty status (or notification of an impending call or order to covered\nactive duty) of a military member, a carrier or self-insured employer may\nrequire the employee to provide a copy of the military member's active duty\norders or other documentation issued by the military which indicates that the\nmilitary member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty\nstatus, and the dates of the military member's covered active duty service. This information need only be provided to the carrier or self-insured employer\nonce. A copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the\nmilitary may be required by the carrier or self-insured employer if the need\nfor leave because of a qualifying exigency arises out of a different covered\nactive duty or call to covered active duty status (or notification of an\nimpending call or order to covered active duty) of the same or a different\nmilitary member. (b) Required information. A request for paid family leave for any qualifying\nexigency specified in section\n380-2.3\nof this Part must be\nsupported by a certification from the employee that sets forth the following\ninformation: (1)\nstatement or\ndescription, signed by the employee, of appropriate facts regarding the\nqualifying exigency for which paid family leave is requested. The facts must be\nsufficient to support the need for leave. Such facts include information on the\ntype of qualifying exigency for which leave is requested and any available\nwritten documentation which supports the request for leave; such documentation, for example, may include a copy of a meeting announcement for informational\nbriefings sponsored by the military, a document confirming an appointment with\na counselor or school official, or a copy of a bill for services for the\nhandling of legal or financial affairs; (2)\napproximate date on which the qualifying\nexigency commenced or will commence; (3)\nif an employee requests leave because of\na qualifying exigency for a single, continuous period of time, the beginning\nand end dates for such absence; (4)\nif an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency on an\nintermittent basis, an estimate of the frequency and duration of the qualifying\nexigency; (5)\nif the qualifying\nexigency involves meeting with a third party, appropriate contact information\nfor the individual or entity with whom the employee is meeting (such as the\nname, title, organization, address, telephone number, fax number, and email\naddress [if available]) and a brief description of the purpose of the meeting; and\n(6)\nif the qualifying exigency\ninvolves rest and recuperation leave, a copy of the military member's rest and\nrecuperation orders, or other documentation issued by the military which\nindicates that the military member has been granted rest and recuperation\nleave, and the dates of the military member's rest and recuperation\nleave. (c) Verification. If an employee submits a complete and sufficient\ncertification to support his or her request for leave because of a qualifying\nexigency, the carrier or self-insured employer may not request additional\ninformation from the employee. However, if the qualifying exigency involves\nmeeting with a third party, the carrier or self-insured employer may contact\nthe individual or entity with whom the employee is meeting for purposes of\nverifying a meeting or appointment schedule and the nature of the meeting\nbetween the employee and the specified individual or entity. The employee's\npermission is not required in order to verify meetings or appointments with\nthird parties, but no additional information may be requested by the carrier or\nself-insured employer. A carrier or self-insured employer also may contact an\nappropriate unit of the Department of Defense to request verification that a\nmilitary member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status\n(or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty); no\nadditional information may be requested, and the employee's permission is not\nrequired.
