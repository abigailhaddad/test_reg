  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 107.3 - Restrictions applying to the production of certified class seed\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Varieties. Varieties must meet the approval of the certifying agency\nto be eligible for certification. (b) Land requirements. Seed potatoes shall not be planted on land where ring rot\ninfected potatoes were produced the previous year. (c) Separation of fields. Fields for inspection must be separated from each other and\nfrom other potatoes by a vacant space of at least one planting row; six feet is\nrecommended. (d) Disease in nearby fields. Any portion of a field entered for certification which is\nwithin 200 feet of potatoes showing 10 percent or more virus disease or more\nthan five percent leaf roll, will be rejected. (e) Seed grown on farms where bacterial ring\nrot is found during the current or previous season is not eligible for\ndesignation as \"Certified-Uihlein Generation 1,\" \"Certified-Uihlein Generation\n2,\" or \"Certified-Uihlein Generation 3.\"\n(f) Inspection procedures. Field and bin inspections shall be conducted on the basis\nof a visual observation of sample plants and tubers under growing conditions\nand during storage. A minimum of two field inspections shall be made during the\ngrowing season with a visual examination being made of a minimum of 100 plants\nfor each planted acre. Inspections of bins and storage areas shall include a\nvisual inspection of at least 100 stored tubers from each harvested acre. Certification shall not extend to diseases which cannot be observed on the\nbasis of a visual inspection of plants and tubers. (g) Tolerance at field\ninspection. Fields are to be kept rogued and are subject to inspection\nat any time. Upon inspection seed lots shall show not more than the following\ntolerances: Factor\n\nFirst inspection\npercent\n2nd or later inspection\npercent\n\nMosaics\n3.00\n1.00\n\nLeaf roll\n3.00\n1.00\n\nOther virus\n1.00.50\n\nSpindle tuber\n1.00\n0.10\n\nTotal virus and spindle tuber\n4.00\n2.00\n\nFusarium\n1\nand\nverticillium wilt\n2.00\n5.00\n\nVarietal mixture.25\n\nRing rot\n2\n0.00\n0.00\n(h) Interpretation of tolerances. Seed lots which comply with the provisions of this standard\nand which are found by inspection of an adequate representative sample to\ncontain no more than the specified tolerance of plants or tubers showing\nvisible symptoms of the diseases and defects mentioned will be approved for\ncertification; however, no assurance is implied that these diseases and defects\nmay not be present in a latent form or in greater amounts or even that the\ninspection of larger samples might not reveal the presence of amounts in excess\nof stated tolerances. Furthermore, with special reference to ring rot, certification implies that both the growing crop and the harvested lot have\nbeen inspected and that no evidence of ring rot has been found, but does not\nimply that the lot is absolutely free from this disease. Precautions always\nshould be taken to guard against the increase or spread of this disease. (i) Roguing. The grower is responsible for roguing all diseased and\nabnormal plants that appear during the growing season. Early removal is\nextremely important in preventing the spread of virus diseases; both the vines\nand tubers should be carried from the field. (j) Florida test. One or more representative samples from each seed lot shall\nbe submitted from each field for planting in the Florida test plot. The number\nof tubers required to be submitted per sample shall be determined by the\ncertifying agency. Tubers selected for the Florida test shall not be smaller\nthan 1 1/2 inches nor larger than 2 1/4 inches. Florida test results shall not\nshow a total in excess of five percent virus (mosaics, leaf roll, other virus)\nand spindle tuber viroid. Seed potatoes shipped before winter test readings are\navailable will be certified if field, harvest and/or bin readings are within\nrequired tolerances. (k) Unsuitable fields. The certifying agency may deny certification to any field\nor seed lot which, in its opinion, would be likely to produce potatoes\nunsuitable for certified seed stock. Consideration for denial may be given to\nunfavorable factors, such as unsuitable cultural conditions, weeds, chemical\ndamage and high aphid population. Footnotes\n1 Fusarium wilt is understood to mean the diseases caused\nby Fusarium solani var. eumartii and Fusarium oxysporum. 2 Ring rot found at any time in bine or graded stock will\ncause rejection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n107.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
