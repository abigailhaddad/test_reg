Tit. 1 § 257.4 - Expression of guarantees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nguarantees for crude protein, equivalent protein from non-protein nitrogen, crude fat, crude fiber and mineral guarantees (when required) shall be in terms\nof percentage by weight. (b) Commercial feeds containing 6 1/2 percent or more mineral elements shall\ninclude in the guaranteed analysis the minimum and maximum percentages of\ncalcium (Ca), if any, the minimum percentage of phosphorus (P), if any, and if\nsalt (NaCl) is added, the minimum and maximum percentages of salt. In such\ncase, the minerals, except salt (NaCl), shall be guaranteed in terms of\npercentage of the element. When calcium and/or salt guarantees are given in the\nguaranteed analysis, such shall conform to the following: (1)\n\nWhen the minimum of calcium or salt is\nfive percent or less, the maximum of the same shall not exceed the minimum by\nmore than one percentage point. (2)\n\nWhen the minimum of calcium or salt is above five percent, the maximum of the\nsame shall not exceed the minimum by more than 20 percent and in no case shall\nthe maximum exceed the minimum by more than five percentage points. (c) Guarantees for minimum vitamin\ncontent of commercial feeds and feed supplements, when made, shall be stated on\nthe label in milligrams per pound of feed, except that: (1)\n\nVitamin A, other than precursors of\nvitamin A, shall be stated in international or USP units per pound. (2)\n\nVitamin D, in products offered for\npoultry feeding, shall be stated in international chick units per\npound. (3)\n\nVitamin D for other uses\nshall be stated in international or USP units per pound. (4)\n\nVitamin E shall be stated in\ninternational or USP units per pound. (5)\n\nGuarantees for vitamin content on the\nlabel of any commercial feed shall state the guarantee as true vitamins, not\ncompounds, with the exception of the compounds, pyridoxine hydrochloride, choline chloride, thiamin, and d-pantothenic acid. (6)\n\nOils and premixes containing vitamin A or\nvitamin D or both may be labeled to show vitamin content in terms of units per\ngram. (d) Guarantees for\ndrugs shall be stated in terms of percent by weight, except that: (1)\n\nAntibiotics present at less than 2,000\ngrams per ton (total) of commercial feed shall be stated in grams per ton of\nsuch feed; (2)\n\nAntibiotics present\nat 2,000 or more grams per ton (total) of commercial feed shall be stated in\ngrams per pound of such feed; (3)\n\nLabels for commercial feeds containing growth promotion and/or feed efficiency\nlevels of antibiotics, which are to be fed continuously as the sole ration, are\nnot required to make quantitative guarantees, except as specifically provided\nin the Federal food additive regulations for certain antibiotics, wherein\nquantitative guarantees are required regardless of the level or purpose of the\nantibiotic. (4)\n\nThe term\n\"milligrams per pound\" may be used for drugs or antibiotics in those cases\nwhere a dosage is given in \"milligrams\" in the feeding directions. (e) Commercial feeds containing\nany added non-protein nitrogen shall be labeled as follows: (1)\n\nComplete feeds, supplements, and\nconcentrates containing added non-protein nitrogen and containing more than\nfive percent protein from natural sources shall be guaranteed as follows: Crude\nprotein, minimum, ________% (This includes not more than ________% equivalent\nprotein from non-protein nitrogen.)\n(2)\n\nMixed feed concentrates and supplements\ncontaining less than five percent protein from natural sources may be\nguaranteed as follows: Equivalent crude protein from non-protein nitrogen, minimum, ________%\n(3)\n\nIngredient\nsources of non-protein nitrogen such as urea, di-ammonium phosphate, ammonium\npolyphosphate solution, ammoniated rice hulls, or other basic non-protein\nnitrogen ingredient sources officially defined by AAFCO, except where the\ncommissioner prescribes otherwise, shall be guaranteed as follows: Nitrogen, minimum, ________% Equivalent crude protein from non-protein nitrogen, minimum, ________%. (f) Mineral\nphosphatic materials for feeding purposes shall be labeled with the guarantee\nfor minimum and maximum percentages of calcium (Ca), the minimum percentage of\nphosphorus (P), and the maximum percentage of fluorine (F), if any.
