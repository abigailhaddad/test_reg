Tit. 1 § 3.19 - Construction and repair of containers and equipment-item 11p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All multiuse containers and equipment\nwith which milk, milk products, whey, and condensed and dry milk products come\ninto contact shall be of smooth, impervious, corrosion-resistant and nontoxic\nmaterial. (b) All milk, milk\nproducts, whey, and condensed and dry milk product-contact surfaces of multiuse\ncontainers and equipment shall consist of: (1)\nstainless steel of the AISI (American\n\nIron and Steel Institute) 300 series; (2)\nequally corrosion-resistant metal which\nis nontoxic and nonabsorbent; (3)\nheat-resistant glass; or\n(4)\nplastic or rubber and rubberlike materials which are relatively inert, resistant to scratching, scoring, decomposition, crazing, chipping and\ndistortion under normal use conditions, which are nontoxic, fat-resistant, relatively nonabsorbent, and do not impart flavor or odor to the product, and\nwhich maintain their original properties under repeated use\nconditions. (c) All\njoints in containers, equipment and utensils shall be flush and finished as\nsmooth as adjoining surfaces. The surface, if vitreous, shall be continuous. Tile floors shall not be used in dryers. Joints on equipment coming in contact\nwith dry products only or used for hot-air piping may be sealed by other\nacceptable means. Where a rotating shaft is inserted through a surface with\nwhich milk, milk products, whey, and condensed and dry milk products come into\ncontact, the joint between the moving and stationary surfaces shall be\nclose-fitting. Grease and oil from gears, bearings and cables shall be isolated\nfrom milk, milk products, whey, and condensed and dry milk products. Where a\nthermometer or temperature sensing element is inserted through a surface with\nwhich milk, milk products, whey, and condensed whey or milk products come into\ncontact, a pressure-tight seal shall be provided between the product and all\nthreads and crevices. (d) All\nopenings in covers of tanks, vats, separators and similar equipment shall be\nprotected by raised edges, or otherwise, to prevent the entrance of surface\ndrainage. Condensation-diverting aprons shall be provided as close to the tank\nor vat as possible on all pipes, thermometers or temperature sensing elements, and other equipment extending into a tank, bowl, vat or distributor, unless a\nwatertight joint is provided. (e) All surfaces with which milk, milk products, whey, and condensed and dry milk\nproducts come into contact, except pneumatic ducts and cyclonic or air\nseparator collectors, shall be easily accessible or demountable for manual\ncleaning or designed for mechanical cleaning. All product-contact surfaces\nshall be readily accessible for inspection and shall be self-draining. Wing\nnuts, bayonet locks and similar devices shall be used whenever possible to\npromote easy disassembly. (f) No\nthreads shall be used in contact with milk, milk products, whey, condensed whey\nor milk products except where needed for functional and safety reasons, such as\nin clarifiers, pumps and separators. Such threads shall be of a sanitary type, except those used on high-pressure lines between the high-pressure pump and the\ndryer nozzle. (g) All multiuse\ncontainers and other equipment shall have rounded corners, be in good repair\nand free from breaks, crevices and corrosion. Milk cans shall have\numbrella-type covers. (h) Strainers, if used, shall be of perforated metal design, and constructed so as\nto utilize single-service strainer media. Multiple-use woven material shall not\nbe used for straining milk, provided that, when required for functional reasons\ninherent to the production of certain products, such as buttermilk, whey, dry\nwhey and dry milk products, woven material may be used where it is impractical\nto use perforated metal. Woven material parts shall be mechanically cleaned by\nsuch methods that thoroughly clean the woven material and do not contaminate\nthe product. (i) Sifters for dry\nproducts shall be constructed so as to utilize single-service or multiservice\nstrainer media conforming with paragraph (b)(4) of this section if plastic\nmaterial, or paragraph (b)(1) if woven stainless steel wire, or be constructed\nof cotton, linen, silk or synthetic fibers which are nontoxic, relatively\ninsoluble, easily cleanable and do not impart a flavor to the product. Tailings\nshall be continuously discharged from sifters through dust-tight connections to\nan enclosed container. Tailing shall not be used for human\nconsumption. (j) All single-service\ncontainers, closures, gaskets and other articles with which milk, milk\nproducts, whey, condensed and dry milk products come into contact shall be\nnontoxic. Articles intended for single-service use shall not be\nreused. (k) All paper, plastics, foil, adhesives and other container components shall be free from deleterious\nsubstances and shall comply with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and\n\nCosmetic Act, as amended. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n3.19\n3-A Sanitary Standards for dairy equipment are\npromulgated jointly by the Sanitary Standards Subcommittee of the Dairy\n\nIndustry Committee, the Committee on Sanitary Procedure of the International\n\nAssociation of Milk, Food and Environmental Sanitarians, Inc., and the Dairy\nand Lipid Products Branch, Division of Food Technology, Bureau of Foods, Food\nand Drug Administration, Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human\n\nServices. Equipment manufactured in conformity with 3-A Sanitary Standards\ncomplies with the sanitary design and construction standards of this\n\nPart. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
