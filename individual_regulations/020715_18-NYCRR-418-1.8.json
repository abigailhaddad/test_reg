(l) Group size and mixing different age\nchildren within groups. (1)\n\nGroup size\nrefers to the number of children cared for together as a unit. Group size is\nused to determine the minimum teacher/child ratio based upon the age of the\nchildren in the group. (2)\n\nGroup\nsize must be maintained in common areas of the day care center building and\ngrounds. (3)\n\nGroups of children may\nnot be mixed together to use outdoor play areas, exercise areas, gym rooms or\nother common areas of the center unless, the space is large enough to\naccommodate multiple groups which must be kept separate. (4)\n\nAny child who is 18 months or older who\nmay not be developmentally ready to advance to the next age group setting may\nbe retained for a period of up to three months. (i) A written agreement concerning this\nretention between the parent and the center is required. (ii)\n\nIf this time period is expected to\nexceed three months, the center, in consultation with early intervention or\nspecial education staff and the parent, may exercise greater discretion in the\nplacement of the child with a developmental disability or delay based on\nconsideration of such factors as the child's developmental readiness, appropriateness of the classroom environment, the level of care the child\nrequires and the needs of the other children in care. (iii)\nA written assessment of the child's\nneed for further retention must be kept on file. (5)\n\nIn consideration of a child's\ndevelopmental readiness, appropriateness of the classroom environment, the\nlevel of care the child requires and the needs of the other children in care, the center may move a toddler to the next age group when that child is within\nthree months of their third birthday. (i) A\nwritten assessment of the child's developmental readiness is required to be\nkept on file. (6)\n\nWhen\npreschool children ages three years to five years are cared for in one group\nthroughout the day, the teacher to child ratio and maximum group size\napplicable to the age of the majority of children must be followed. (7)\n\nExcept for office approved continuity of\ncare classrooms, infants may never be mixed with other age groups. (8)\n\nExcept for office approved continuity of\ncare classrooms, children under three years of age may not participate in mixed\nage groups except for limited periods of time at the beginning and end of the\nchild day care center's daily operation. (9)\n\nWhen toddlers are cared for with\npreschool children in a mixed age group at the very beginning or very end of\nthe day, the teacher/child ratio and maximum group size applicable to children\naged 18 months to 36 months must be followed. (10)\n\nWhen preschool children are cared for in\nschool age groups at the very beginning or very end of the day, the\nteacher/child ratio and maximum group size applicable to the youngest child in\nthe group must be followed. (11)\n\nDay care centers that have been approved to operate a school-age children\ncomponent in their day care center may only mix school age children with\npre-school children at the very beginning of the day and the very end of the\nday. School age children may never be mixed with pre-school children for the\nentire period of time they are in care at the center. (12)\n\nWhen school age children are mixed with\npre-school children at the beginning and end of the day, toddlers may not be\nmixed in these groups. School age children may not be mixed with children under\nage three at any time. (m) There must be a director, group teacher\nor assistant teacher supervising all applicants, volunteers and persons in the\nprocess of approval. (n) The use of\nany type of personal electronic media device for social or entertainment\npurposes, including but not limited to, listening to music on headphones, playing screen games, surfing the internet, sending e-mails, or making personal\ncalls while supervising children is prohibited.

(1)\n\nNo child can\nbe released from the child day care center to any person other than his or her\nparent, a person(s) currently designated in writing by such parent to receive\nthe child, or another person authorized by law to take custody of a\nchild. (2)\n\nNo child can be released\nfrom the child day care center unsupervised except upon written permission of\nthe child's parent. Such permission must be acceptable to the child day care\ncenter and should take into consideration such factors as the child's age and\nmaturity, proximity to his or her home, and safety of the\nneighborhood. (3)\n\nWhen\ntransportation is provided as a service by the program, no child can be\nreleased from the day care program directly to the child's home or other\ndestination without first verifying that the parent or person(s) designated by\nthe parent to receive the child is present at that destination to receive the\nchild. (q) Visitor\ncontrol procedures. (1)\n\nEach day care\ncenter shall require any and all visitors to the facility to: (i) sign in upon entry to the\npremises; (ii)\nindicate in writing\nthe date of the visit and the time of entry to the facility; (iii)\nclearly state in writing the purpose of\nthe visit; and\n(iv)\nsign out upon\ndeparture from the facility indicating in writing the time of\ndeparture. (2)\n\nEach day\ncare center shall establish written rules and policies as are necessary to\nprovide for monitoring and control of visitors to protect the health, safety\nand welfare of children in care. (r) Continuity of care. The continuity of care model requires that the center\nmake every effort to establish and maintain a primary relationship between\nteachers and children and their respective families over a period of years. In\nthe continuity of care model, infants/toddlers and their teachers stay together\nuntil all children in the group are 36 months of age. The core concept in\ncontinuity of care is the practice that assigns a child to one teacher who\nbecomes responsible for the child and for communication with the child's\nparents. The teachers must develop positive relationships with each child\nassigned to his/her care, tending to their physical and emotional needs and\nworking together with a second group teacher or assistant teacher in the group\nwho maintains this same relationship with another small number of children\nassigned to her/him. While each teacher is assigned to a small number of\nchildren, both are also responsible as a back-up for each other's assigned\nchildren when a need arises to safeguard the health and safety of any child in\nthe classroom. (1)\n\nFor purpose of\nmaintaining a continuity of care model, centers may mix children six weeks of\nage to 36 months of age in one classroom, in compliance with the provisions of\nsubdivision (r) of this section. (2)\n\nThe teachers assigned to the continuity\nof care classrooms must receive instruction regarding the concepts of\ncontinuity of care and develop positive relationships with each child assigned\nto his/her care, tending to their physical and emotional needs. (3)\n\nIn order that infants and toddlers\ndevelop consistent and significant positive relationships with teachers working\nin continuity of care classrooms, teachers must be assigned to that classroom\nand those children only, except that toddlers and their teacher participating\nin continuity of care classrooms may participate in the center's plans for\nsupervision at the very beginning and very end of the daily operation as\npermitted per subdivision (l) of this section. (4)\n\nContinuity of care teachers will be\ndirectly responsible for communication with the assigned children's\nparents. (5)\n\nWhile each teacher\nworking in a continuity of care classroom is assigned to a small number of\nchildren in the classroom, the teachers are also responsible as each other's\nback-up when a need arises to safeguard the health and safety of any child in\nthe classroom. (6)\n\nParents of\nchildren who will be assigned to a continuity of care classroom must be\ninformed by the program about this model of care and agree in writing to\nplacing their child in the continuity of care group. (7)\n\nThe teacher/child ratio and maximum group\nsize in continuity of care classrooms must be applicable to the youngest child\nin the group and consistent with subdivision (k) of this section. (8)\n\nThe center's continuity of care\nprogramming, furnishings, equipment and size shall meet the developmental\nappropriate needs of all the children in the room. (9)\n\nAll proposed models of continuity of care\nmust be submitted to the office for review and approval prior to\nimplementation. (s) Day\ncare centers that do not offer care to infant and toddlers may enroll children\nwho will turn three by December 1st of that same year if the day care center\nenrollment coincides with the start of the local public school year.
