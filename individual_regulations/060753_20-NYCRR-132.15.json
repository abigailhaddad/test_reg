  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 132.15 - Apportionment and allocation of income from business carried on partly within and partly without New York State\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a\nnonresident individual, or a partnership of which a nonresident individual is a\nmember, carries on a business, trade, profession or occupation both within and\nwithout New York State, the items of income, gain, loss and deduction\nattributable to such business, trade, profession or occupation must be\napportioned and allocated to New York State on a fair and equitable basis in\naccordance with approved methods of accounting. (b) If the books of the business are so kept\nas regularly to disclose, to the satisfaction of the Tax Commission, the\nproportion of the net amount of the items of income, gain, loss and deduction\nderived from or connected with New York State sources, the New York State\nnonresident personal income tax return of the taxpayer must disclose the total\namount of such items, the net amount of such items allocated to New York State, and the basis upon which such allocation is made. (c) If the books and records of the business\ndo not disclose, to the satisfaction of the Tax Commission, the proportion of\nthe net amount of the items of income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to\nthe activities of the business carried on in New York State, such proportion\nwill, except as provided in section\n132.16\nof this Part and section\n112.7\n(b) of this Title, be determined by multiplying (1) the net amount of the items of\nincome, gain, loss and deduction of the business by (2) the average of the\npercentages described in subdivisions (d) through (f) of this\nsection. (d) Property percentage. (1)\n\nGeneral. The property percentage is\ncomputed by dividing\n(i) the average of the\nvalues, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of real and tangible\npersonal property owned by or rented to the taxpayer, which is connected with\nthe business and located within New York State, by\n(ii)\nthe average of the values, at the\nbeginning and end of the taxable year, of all real and tangible personal\nproperty, owned by or rented to the taxpayer, which is connected with the\nbusiness and located both within and without New York State. For this purpose, real and tangible personal property includes real and tangible personal\nproperty rented to the taxpayer and used in the business. Real property the\nincome or gain from which is allocated pursuant to section\n132.16\nof this Part is disregarded in computing the property percentage described in\nthis paragraph. (2)\n\nRented real and tangible personal property. (i) The fair market value of real and\ntangible personal property, both within and without New York State, which is\nrented to the taxpayer is determined by multiplying the gross rents payable\nduring the taxable year by eight. (ii)\n\nGross rent, as used in this paragraph, is the actual sum of money or other consideration payable directly or\nindirectly by the taxpayer or for the taxpayer's benefit for the use or\npossession of the property, and includes: (a) any amount payable for the use or possession of real and tangible personal\nproperty, or any part thereof, whether designated as a fixed sum of money or as\na percentage of sales, profits or otherwise; (b) any amount payable as additional rent or\nin lieu of rent, such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs or any other\namount required to be paid by the terms of a lease or other\narrangement; (c) a proportionate\npart of the cost of any improvement to real and tangible personal property made\nby or on behalf of the taxpayer which reverts to the owner or lessor upon\ntermination of a lease or other arrangement, based on the unexpired term of the\nlease commencing with the date the improvement is completed (or the life of the\nimprovement if its life expectancy is less than the unexpired term of the\nlease); provided, however, that where a building is erected on leased land by\nor on behalf of the taxpayer, the value of the land is determined by\nmultiplying the gross rent by eight, and the value of the building is\ndetermined in the same manner as if owned by the taxpayer. The proportionate\npart of the cost of an improvement (other than a building on leased land) is\ngenerally equal to the amount of amortization allowed in computing New York\nadjusted gross income, whether the lease does or does not contain an option of\nrenewal. (iii)\n\nGross\nrents do not include: (a) any portion of a\npayment or credit, to the proprietor of the business or to a partner in the\npartnership conducting the business, for the use of real or tangible personal\nproperty; (b) amounts payable as\nseparate charges for water and electric service furnished by the\nlessor; (c) amounts payable for\nstorage, where no designated space under the control of the taxpayer as a\ntenant is rented for storage purposes; or\n(d) that portion of any rental payment which, in the discretion of the Commissioner, is applicable to property subleased by\nthe taxpayer and not used by the taxpayer in the carrying on of the business. (3)\n\nOther\nvaluation methods. If the general method outlined in this subdivision results\nin valuations which are inaccurate or which are not fair and equitable, any\nother method which will fairly and equitably reflect the value may be adopted\nby the Commissioner, either on the Commissioner's own motion or on request of a\ntaxpayer. A request by a taxpayer for an alternative method may be made at the\ntime the New York State nonresident personal income tax return to which the\nrequest relates is filed. A request is made by using the proposed method in the\npersonal income tax return. The proposed method must be fully explained in the\npersonal income tax return. Any request must contain all facts with respect to\nthe property forming the basis for the proposed valuation and also a\ncomputation of the value of the rented real and tangible personal property\nbased on gross rents in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision. Once\napproved by the Commissioner, such basis or such other method must be used for\nsubsequent years until the facts upon which it is based are materially\nchanged. (e) Payroll\npercentage. The payroll percentage is computed by dividing (1) the total wages, salaries and other personal service compensation paid or incurred during the\ntaxable year to employees, in connection with business carried on within New\n\nYork State, by (2) the total of all wages, salaries and other personal service\ncompensation paid or incurred during the taxable year to employees in\nconnection with the business carried on both within and without New York\n\nState. (f) Gross income percentage. The gross income percentage is computed by dividing (1) the gross sales or\ncharges for services performed by or through an office, branch or agency of the\nbusiness located within New York State, by (2) the total of all gross sales or\ncharges for services performed within and without New York State. The sales or\ncharges to be allocated to New York State include all sales negotiated or\nconsummated, and charges for services performed, by an employee, agent, agency\nor independent contractor chiefly situated at, connected by contract or\notherwise with, or sent out from, offices, branches of the business, or other\nagencies, situated within New York State.
