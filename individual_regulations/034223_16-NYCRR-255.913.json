  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.913 - Deviation from the requirements of this part\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. ASME/ANSI B31.8S (as described\nin section\n10.3\nof this Title) provides the\nessential features of a performance-based or a prescriptive integrity\nmanagement program. An operator that uses a performance-based approach that\nsatisfies the requirements for exceptional performance in subdivision (b) of\nthis section may deviate from certain requirements in sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part, as provided\nin subdivision (c) of this section. (b) Exceptional performance. An operator must\nbe able to demonstrate the exceptional performance of its integrity management\nprogram through the following actions. (1)\n\nTo\ndeviate from any of the requirements set forth in subdivision (c) of this\nsection, an operator must have a performance-based integrity management program\nthat meets or exceed the performance-based requirements of ASME/ANSI B31.8S and\nincludes, at a minimum, the following elements: (i) a comprehensive process for risk\nanalysis; (ii)\nall risk factor data\nused to support the program; (iii)\na comprehensive data integration process; (iv)\na procedure for applying lessons learned\nfrom assessment of covered pipeline segments to pipeline segments not covered\nby sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part; (v) a procedure for evaluating every\nincident, including its cause, within the operator's sector of the pipeline\nindustry for implications both to the operator's pipeline system and to the\noperator's integrity management program; (vi)\na performance matrix that demonstrates\nthe program has been effective in ensuring the integrity of the covered\nsegments by controlling the identified threats to the covered\nsegments; (vii)\nsemiannual\nperformance measures beyond those required in section\n255.945\nof this Part that are part\nof the operator's performance plan. (See section 255.91l[i] of this Part.) An\noperator must submit these measures, by electronic or other means, on a\nsemiannual frequency to the department and OPS in accordance with section\n255.951\nof this Part; and\n(viii)\nan analysis that\nsupports the desired integrity reassessment interval and the remediation\nmethods to be used for all covered segments. (2)\n\nIn addition to the requirements for the\nperformance-based plan, an operator must: (i) Have completed at least two integrity assessments on each covered pipeline\nsegment the operator is including under the performance based approach, and be\nable to demonstrate that each assessment effectively addressed the identified\nthreats on the covered segment. (ii)\n\nRemediate all anomalies identified in\nthe more recent assessment according to the requirements in section\n255.933\nof this Part, and\nincorporate the results and lessons learned from the more recent assessment\ninto the operator's data integration and risk assessment. (c) Deviation. Once an operator\nhas demonstrated that it has satisfied the requirements of subdivision (b) of\nthis section, the operator may deviate from the prescriptive requirements of\nASME/ANSI B31.8S and of sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part only in the\nfollowing instances: (1)\n\nThe time frame for\nreassessment as provided in section\n255.939\nof this Part except that\nreassessment by some method allowed under sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part (e.g., confirmatory direct assessment) must be carried out at intervals no longer than\nseven years. (2)\n\nThe time frame for\nremediation as provided in section\n255.933\nof this Part if the\noperator demonstrates the time frame will not jeopardize the safety of the\ncovered segment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.913\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
