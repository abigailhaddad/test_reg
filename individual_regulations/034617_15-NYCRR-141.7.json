  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 141.7 - Adm course evaluation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Consistent with the requirements in\nsection\n138.4\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, sponsors will be required to evaluate the effectiveness of their ADM\ncourse, as well as their classroom based course. The timing of when the\nevaluation must be done may occur anytime within the five year period, when the\nnumber of students have completed the course provides a sufficient sample to\nevaluate per section\n138.4\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. Sponsors are expected to evaluate their ADM course once over the\nfive-year period. In the event sufficient sampling cannot be done due to the\nnumber of students completing the course, DMV will accept a smaller ADM sample. Course effectiveness documentation must be completed and submitted to the\ndepartment no less than 60 business days prior to the end of the pilot\nprogram. (b) In order to evaluate\nmotorists' responses to the ADM delivery methods, sponsors will be required to\ncollect data for each student completer for these factors: (1)\noverall course satisfaction; (2)\nperception that course was\ninteresting; (3)\nperception that\ncourse was easy to use; and\n(4)\nperception that the course will positively influence their future driving\nperformance. (c) Appendix A (section\n141.14\nof this Part) defines the\nstudent completion data requirements in detail. (d) The student completion information, as\ndescribed in this section and in Appendix A (section\n141.14\nof this Part), shall be\nreported in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n141.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
