Tit. 22 § 208.13 - Exchange of medical reports in personal injury and wrongful death actions\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept where the court otherwise directs, in\nall actions in which recovery is sought for personal injuries, disability or\ndeath, physical examinations and the exchange of medical information shall be\ngoverned by the provisions hereinafter set forth: (a) At any time after joinder of issue\nand service of a bill of particulars, the party to be examined or any other\nparty may serve on all other parties a notice fixing the time and place of\nexamination. Unless otherwise stipulated the examination shall be held not less\nthan 30 nor more than 60 days after service of the notice. If served by any\nparty other than the party to be examined, the notice shall name the examining\nmedical provider or providers. If the notice is served by the party to be\nexamined, the examining parties shall, within 10 days of receipt thereof, submit to the party to be examined the name of the medical providers who will\nconduct the examination. Any party may move to modify or vacate the notice\nfixing the time and place of examination or the notice naming the examining\nmedical providers, within 10 days of the receipt thereof, on the grounds that\nthe time or place fixed or the medical provider named is objectionable, or that\nthe nature of the action is such that the interests of justice will not be\nserved by an examination, exchange of medical reports or delivery of\nauthorizations. (b) At\nleast 20 days before the date of such examination, or on such other date as the\ncourt may direct, the party to be examined shall serve upon and deliver to all\nother parties the following, which may be used by the examining medical\nprovider: (1)\ncopies of the\nmedical reports of those medical providers who have previously treated or\nexamined the party seeking recovery. These shall include a recital of the\ninjuries and conditions as to which testimony will be offered at the trial, referring to and identifying those X-ray and technicians' reports which will be\noffered at the trial, including a description of the injuries sustained, a\ndiagnosis, and prognosis. Medical reports may consist of completed medical\nprovider, workers' compensation, or insurance forms that provide the\ninformation required by this paragraph; and\n(2)\nduly executed and acknowledged\nwritten authorizations permitting all parties to obtain and make copies of all\nhospital records and such other records, including X-ray and technicians'\nreports, as may be referred to and identified in the reports of those medical\nproviders who have treated or examined the party seeking recovery. (c) Copies of the\nreports of the medical providers making examinations pursuant to this section\nshall be served on all other parties within 45 days after completion of the\nexamination. These shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of\nthis section. (d) In\nactions where the cause of death is in issue, each party shall serve upon all\nother parties copies of the reports of all treating or examining medical\nproviders whose testimony will be offered at the trial, complying with the\nrequirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the party seeking to\nrecover shall deliver to all other parties authorizations to examine and obtain\ncopies of all hospital records, autopsy or post-mortem reports, and such other\nrecords as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Copies of these\nreports and the required authorizations shall be served and delivered with the\nbill of particulars by the party seeking to recover. All other parties shall\nserve copies of the reports of their medical providers within 45 days\nthereafter. In any case where the interests of justice will not be promoted by\nservice of such reports and delivery of such authorizations, an order\ndispensing with either or both may be obtained. (e) Parties relying solely on hospital\nrecords may so certify in lieu of serving medical providers' reports. (f) No case otherwise eligible\nto be noticed for trial may be noticed unless there has been compliance with\nthis rule or an order dispensing with compliance or extending the time therefor\nhas been obtained; or, where the party to be examined was served a notice as\nprovided in subdivision (a) of this section, and the party so served has not\nresponded thereto. (g) In the event that the party examined intends at the trial to offer evidence of\nfurther or additional injuries or conditions, nonexistent or not known to exist\nat the time of service of the original medical reports, such party shall, within 30 days after the discovery thereof, and not later than 30 days before\ntrial, serve upon all parties a supplemental medical report complying with the\nrequirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and shall specify a time, not\nmore than 10 days thereafter and a place at which a further examination may be\nhad. Further authorizations to examine and make copies of additional hospital\nrecords, other records, X-ray or other technicians' reports as provided in\nparagraph (b)(2) of this section must also be delivered with the medical\nreports. Copies of the reports of the examining medical providers, complying\nwith the requirements of subdivision (c) of this section, shall be served\nwithin 10 days after completion of such further examination. If any party\ndesires at the trial to offer the testimony of additional treating or examining\nmedical providers, other than whose medical reports have been previously\nexchanged, the medical reports of such medical providers, complying with the\nrequirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be served upon all\nparties at least 30 days before trial. (h) Unless an order to the contrary is\nmade, or unless the judge presiding at the trial in the interests of justice\nand upon a showing of good cause shall hold otherwise, the party seeking to\nrecover damages shall be precluded at the trial from offering in evidence any\npart of the hospital records and all other records, including autopsy or\npost-mortem records, X-ray reports or reports of other technicians, not made\navailable pursuant to this rule, and no party shall be permitted to offer any\nevidence of injuries or conditions not set forth or put in issue in the\nrespective medical reports previously exchanged, nor will the court hear the\ntestimony of any treating or examining medical providers whose medical reports\nhave not been served as provided by this rule. (i) Orders transferring cases pending in\nother courts which are subject to the provisions of this section, whether or\nnot such cases are consolidated with cases pending in the court to which\ntransferred, shall contain such provisions as are required to bring the\ntransferred cases into compliance with this rule. (j) Any party may move to compel\ncompliance or to be relieved from compliance with this rule or any provision\nthereof, but motions directed to the sufficiency of medical reports must be\nmade within 20 days of receipt of such reports. All motions under this rule may\nbe made on affidavits of attorneys, shall be made on notice, returnable at the\nappropriate motion part and shall be granted or denied on such terms as to\ncosts, calendar position and dates of compliance with any provision of this\nrule as the court in its discretion shall direct. (k) Where an examination is\nconducted on consent prior to the institution of an action, the party to be\nexamined shall deliver the documents specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of\nthis section, and the report of the examining medical provider shall be\ndelivered as provided in subdivision (c) of this section. In that event\nexamination after institution of the action may be waived. The waiver, which\nshall recite that medical reports have been exchanged and that all parties\nwaive further physical examination, shall be filed with the note of issue. This\nshall not be a bar, however, to proceeding under subdivision (g) of this\nsection in a proper case. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
