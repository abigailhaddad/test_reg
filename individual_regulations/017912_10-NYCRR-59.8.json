  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 59.8 - Revocation or suspension of permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The commissioner or the training agencies may at any time and from time to time require breath analysis instrument operators or technical supervisors to demonstrate their ability to operate properly the breath analysis instrument(s) for which they hold a permit. (b) The operator's permit may be revoked by the commissioner based on information acquired by the commissioner, or a training agency, that the operator does not conduct breath tests in accordance with techniques and methods as instructed by the training agency, that the operator's performance is unreliable, or the operator is incompetent. Upon revocation, the operator shall return any and all permits to the commissioner. (c) The training agency may suspend the permit of any operator under its supervision when, in its judgment, the operator does not conduct breath tests in accordance with techniques and methods as established by the training agency, the operator's performance is unreliable or the operator is incompetent. The training agency shall immediately notify the commissioner in writing of any such suspension and furnish a copy of such notice to the suspended operator, who shall not be permitted to operate the breath analysis instrument until such time as the suspension is removed. (d) An operator whose permit has been suspended by the training agency may appeal to the commissioner who shall decide whether suspension shall be affirmed or set aside. The commissioner may reinstate the permit of the operator making such appeal under such conditions as the commissioner deems necessary. (e) An operator whose permit has been revoked shall not be eligible for a new permit within 12 months from the date of revocation or at such other time as may be determined by the commissioner.
