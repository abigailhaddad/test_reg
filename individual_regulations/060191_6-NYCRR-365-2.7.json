  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 365-2.7 - Requirements for autoclaves used to treat RMW\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the requirements outlined in sections\n365-2.5\nand 2.6 of this Subpart, RMW treatment facilities that employ the use of autoclaves must comply with the\nfollowing criteria. (a) An autoclave\nthat fails to meet the criteria for effective treatment pursuant to this\nsection after validation testing at the site of installation cannot be used to\ntreat RMW. (b) A facility that\nseeks to operate an autoclave at other than the generally accepted operating\nparameters (i.e., time, temperature and pressure) outlined in this section must\nobtain approval from the NYSDOH as an alternative treatment method. (c) The facility must be designed to promote\nsafe and effective operation of the autoclave. The facility must have\nprocedures to ensure: (1)\nthe autoclave meets\nthe criteria in this Subpart for effective treatment of RMW; (2)\nloads contain only those items or types\nof RMW for which effective treatment has been demonstrated by validation\ntesting; and exclude RMW for which effective treatment by the system has not\nbeen demonstrated or is prohibited; (3)\neach load is treated using residence\ntime, temperature and pressure, and with one or more vacuum cycles that have\nbeen validated as effective for the treatment of RMW, and conditions of\ntreatment are monitored and documented for each load; (4)\nthe effectiveness of treatment is\nmaintained, by including, as applicable, procedures for and frequency of: calibration verification and recalibration of parametric controls; monitoring\nby bio-challenge testing or other demonstration that treatment has been\nattained; and preventative maintenance of engineering controls (e.g., charcoal, HEPA filters, etc.) and diagnostic procedures for electronic controls (e.g., integrated computers and mechanical components, etc.); (5)\noccupational exposure is minimized, and\nphysical injury to operators is prevented during loading, the cycle, and\nunloading the autoclave; and\n(6)\npersonnel are provided training on the routine operation of the autoclave, are\nkept current with manufacturer recommendations for operation, and have been\ninstructed in emergency procedures for handling malfunctioning systems and\nuntreated RMW. Training programs must mandate initial training and retraining\nat least once per calendar year and as necessary for presenting updates on\noperational information. (d) Monitoring autoclave operation. (1)\n\nParametric controls must be employed to\nmonitor operating parameters automatically and continuously throughout the\nentire cycle, and generate a record of operating parameters for each\ncycle. (2)\n\nRoutine operational\nperformance of an autoclave must be monitored by bio-challenge testing, conducted in accordance with subdivision\n365-2.7\n(h) of this\n\nSection using the validation protocol. (3)\n\nIf an autoclave fails to attain no growth\nin viable spores concentration upon bio-challenge testing or indicators fail to\nshow expected results (i.e., a color change), the load must be handled as\nuntreated RMW, and the facility must demonstrate, through a repeat of\nbio-challenge testing, that the autoclave effectively treats RMW before\nresuming its use for treatment purposes. (e) Containment of RMW for treatment by\nautoclaving must be by a container or containment system designed to withstand\nthe temperature and pressure of autoclaving, and may, except for sharps, consist solely of a bag. (f) If the\ncontainer or containment system does not, by design, allow steam to come into\ndirect contact with the RMW, the facility must take actions to ensure\ncontact. (g) Sharps treated by\nautoclaving must be destroyed prior to disposal. (h) Routine bio-challenge testing for\nautoclaves. An autoclave that has been validated and authorized to treat RMW\nmust conduct routine bio-challenge testing as follows: (1)\n\nDuring the first 30 days of actual\noperation, the first and third load each day must include biological indicators\nplaced in the waste. (2)\n\nAfter 30\ndays of operation, one load each day must include biological indicators placed\nin the waste. (3)\n\nAfter six months\nof successful operation with no failures in daily testing, bio-challenge\ntesting may be conducted every 40 hours of operation. Any bio-challenge test\nfailures will require repeat bio-challenge testing. (4)\n\nBio-challenge testing must include at\nleast one-third of the number of biological indicators that are required for\nvalidation or two indicators, whichever is greater. (5)\n\nEvery 200 hours of operation, biological\nindicators used during bio-challenge testing must be evaluated by an\nindependent laboratory. (6)\n\nBio-containment facilities at BSL 3 or 4 using pass-through treatment systems\nmust conduct bio-challenge testing for each load of RMW. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
