  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 11.4 - Termination or disconnection of residential service, and suspension of distribution service pursuant to public service law, section 32(5)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Termination or disconnection of\nresidential service. This subdivision sets forth termination and disconnection\nprocedures applicable where a utility provides only distribution service and\nseeks to terminate the distribution service, the utility provides both\ndistribution service and commodity supply and seeks to terminate them both or\nan ESCO seeks to terminate commodity supply. Where an ESCO seeks suspension of\na residential customer's distribution service due to the customer's non-payment\nof the commodity portion of a consolidated bill, subdivision (b) of this\nsection also applies. (1)\n\nConditions for\ntermination or disconnection. A utility may terminate or disconnect residential\nservice as provided for in these rules if the customer: (i) fails to pay charges for services\nrendered at any time during the preceding 12 months; provided, however, that\ntermination or disconnection of service for bills due for service rendered\nduring periods in excess of the 12-month period is permitted in cases involving\nbilling disputes during the 12-month period, estimated bills, the culpable\nconduct of the customer or excusable utility delays; and provided further, that\nthe utility shall commence any such billing not more than four months after the\nresolution of the billing dispute, the adjustment to estimated bills, or the\ncessation of excusable utility delays or delays caused by the customer's\nculpable conduct; or\n(ii)\nfails to\npay amounts due under a deferred payment agreement; (iii)\nfails to pay or agree in writing to pay\nequipment and installation charges relating to the initiation of service; or\n(iv)\nfails to pay a lawfully\nrequired deposit; and\n(v) is sent a\nfinal notice of termination or disconnection no less than 15 days before the\ntermination or disconnection date shown on the notice. (2)\n\nFinal notice. A final notice of\ntermination or disconnection shall clearly state or include: (i) the earliest date on which termination or\ndisconnection may occur; (ii)\nthe\nreasons for termination or disconnection, including the total amount required\nto be paid, and the manner in which termination or disconnection may be\navoided; (iii)\nthe address and\nphone number of the office of the utility that the customer may contact in\nreference to his account; (iv)\nthe\navailability of utility procedures for handling complaints; and\n(v) a summary, prepared or approved by the\ncommission or its authorized designee, of the protections available under this\n\nPart, together with a notice that any customer eligible for such protections\nshould contact the utility. The final notice of termination or disconnection may\ninclude any additional information not inconsistent with this Part. The final\nnotice of termination from on ESCO, however, shall inform the customer that\nsuspension of the customer's distribution service can accompany the ESCO's\ncommodity termination, even if the customer's account for distribution service\nis current. In addition, the notice shall have printed on its face, in a size\ntype capable of attracting immediate attention, language conveying the\nfollowing: THIS IS A FINAL TERMINATION NOTICE. PLEASE REFER TO THIS\nNOTICE WHEN PAYING THIS BILL. OR\nTHIS IS A FINAL DISCONNECTION NOTICE. PLEASE REFER TO THIS\nNOTICE WHEN PAYING THIS BILL. (3)\n\nNotice of termination or\ndisconnection--time. (i) No utility shall\nterminate or disconnect service under this Part until at least 15 days after a\nfinal notice of termination or disconnection: (a) has been served personally upon the\nresidential customer; or\n(b) has\nbeen mailed to the residential customer at the premises where service is\nrendered. (ii)\n\nIf an\nalternative address for mailing purposes has been previously provided in\nwriting to a utility, no utility shall terminate or disconnect service under\nthis Part until at least 15 calendar days after a final notice of termination\nor disconnection: (a) has been mailed to the\npremises where service is rendered and to the residential customer at the\nalternative address; or\n(b) has\nbeen mailed to the residential customer at the alternative address, and\naccording to procedures filed by the utility with the Office of Consumer\n\nServices, either: (1)\nhas been served\npersonally upon an adult resident of the premises where service is\nrendered; (2)\nhas been explained by\ntelephone to an adult resident of the premises where service is rendered; or\n(3)\nhas been posted in a\nconspicuous place at the premises where service is rendered. (iii)\nA utility may not\nissue or send a final notice of termination or disconnection unless at least 20\ndays have elapsed from the date payment was due. A utility may specify the date\npayment is due, provided that such date does not occur before personal service\nof the bill or three days after the mailing of the bill. (4)\n\nTermination or disconnection of\nservice--time. A utility complying with the conditions set forth in this\nsection may terminate or disconnect service to a residential customer for\nnonpayment of bills only between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through\n\nThursday, provided such day or the following day is not: (i) a public holiday, as defined in the\n\nGeneral Construction Law; or\n(ii)\na\nday on which the main business office of the utility is closed for business. No\nutility shall terminate or disconnect service to any residential customer for\nnonpayment of bills during a two-week period encompassing Christmas and New\n\nYear's Day. (5)\n\nNo\ntermination or disconnection without verification of delinquent account. (i) No utility shall terminate or disconnect\nservice for nonpayment of bills rendered, unless: (a) it shall have verified that payment has\nnot been received at any office of the utility or at any office of an\nauthorized collection agent through the end of the notice period required by\nthis Part; and\n(b) it shall have\nverified on the day termination or disconnection occurs that payment has not\nbeen posted to the customer's account as of the opening of business on that\nday, or shall have complied with procedures established pursuant to\nsubparagraph (6)(ii) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nIn the case of a utility which serves a\ngeographic area of this State involving more than six counties the commission\nmay grant a waiver of the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph\nupon approval by the commission of an alternate procedure for verification of\npayments which accomplishes the basic purposes of such paragraph. (6)\n\nRapid posting of payments in\nresponse to notices of termination or disconnection. Every utility shall take\nreasonable steps to establish procedures to ensure that any payments made in\nresponse to final notices of termination or disconnection, when the customer\nbrings the fact that such a notice has been issued to the attention of the\nutility or its collection agents: (i) are\nposted to the customer's account on the day payment is received; or\n(ii)\nare processed in some manner so that\ntermination or disconnection will not occur. (7)\n\nPayment to utility personnel. If a\nresidential customer offers payment of the full amount that forms the basis for\na scheduled termination or disconnection at the time of termination or\ndisconnection, the utility's representative shall be obliged to accept such\npayment and shall not terminate or disconnect service. Whenever such payment is\nmade, the utility representative shall provide the customer a receipt showing\nthe date, account, name, address and amount received. (8)\n\nNo additional notice required when\npayment by check is subsequently dishonored. Receipt of a subsequently\ndishonored negotiable instrument in response to a notice of termination or\ndisconnection or tendered to a utility representative shall not constitute\npayment of a residential customer's account and no utility shall be required to\nissue additional notice prior to termination or disconnection. (9)\n\nSpecial notification of social services\nofficial. (i) After a utility has sent a\nfinal notice of termination or disconnection to a residential customer who it\nknows is receiving public assistance, supplemental security income benefits or\nadditional State payments pursuant to the Social Services Law, and for whom the\nutility has not received a guarantee of future payment from the local social\nservices commissioner, it shall, not more than five days nor less than three\ndays before the intended termination or disconnection, notify an appropriate\nofficial of the local social services district that payment for utility\nservices has not been made. Such notification shall state that the customer has\nbeen sent a final notice of termination or disconnection, specify the amount of\narrears, and state the earliest date on which termination or disconnection may\noccur. (ii)\n\nIn the case of a\ncustomer for whom the utility has received a guarantee of future payment from\nthe local social services commissioner, the utility shall send a notice of\nnonpayment stating that payment has not been made and indicating the amount of\nthe arrears to the recipient and to the local social services commissioner at\nthe time the account would otherwise be subject to a final notice of\ntermination or disconnection. (iii)\n\nIf the notification required by subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is made\norally, the utility shall within one business day mail a written notification\nto such social services official. (iv)\n\nEach utility shall, after consultation\nwith an appropriate official in the social services district of each county\nserved by the utility in whole or in part, compile and maintain a list of the\nsocial services officials who are to receive such notifications. (v) A utility may notify an appropriate\nsocial services official that a customer it knows is receiving public\nassistance, supplemental security income benefits or additional State payments\nhas failed to make timely payment for utility service, whenever it believes\nspecial circumstances affecting such customer should be brought to the\nimmediate attention of the social services official. Such notification shall\ndescribe the special circumstances observed, specify the amount of arrears, and\nstate the scheduled date of termination or disconnection, if one has been\nset. (b) Suspension of distribution service pursuant to Public Service Law, section\n32(5). This subdivision sets forth procedures applicable where an ESCO seeks\nsuspension of a residential customer's distribution service due to the\ncustomer's non-payment of the commodity portion of a consolidated bill. Suspension pursuant to Public Service Law, section 32(5) of a residential\ncustomer's distribution service and any related services provided by the\ndistribution utility shall be limited to only such distribution service that is\nused to distribute (or is related to) the commodity that is or was supplied by\nthe requesting ESCO and for which the customer is in arrears. (1)\n\nWhen requested by an ESCO, a distribution\nutility shall suspend its distribution service and any other related services\nthe distribution utility may provide to a residential customer or multiple\ndwelling or two-family dwelling, if: (i) the\nESCO that was providing commodity supply to such customer has terminated the\ncustomer's commodity supply in compliance with all applicable provisions of\nsubdivision (a) of this section; (ii)\nthe ESCO that was providing commodity\nsupply to such customer notifies the distribution utility that commodity supply\nhas been terminated in compliance with subdivision (a) of this\nsection; (iii)\nthe ESCO's\nnotification to the distribution utility demonstrates compliance with\nsubdivision (a) of this section (such demonstration shall include, but not be\nlimited to, providing a copy of the termination notice, proof that the\ntermination notice was timely sent and was received by the customer or the\ncustomer's representative, and proof that termination took place at a\npermissible time, as specified in paragraph [a][4] of this section); (iv)\nexcept in the case of a service to a\nmultiple dwelling pursuant to section\n33\nof the\n\nPublic Service Law, the ESCO demonstrates that such customer was billed using a\nconsolidated bill; (v) the\ndistribution utility provided distribution service to the customer at the time\nthe ESCO terminated its commodity supply; (vi)\nthe ESCO confirms that it is able to and\nwill take all actions within its control necessary to restore commodity supply\nto such customer in accordance with the agreement for such service between the\nESCO and the customer, if the customer makes full payment of the arrears that\nwere the basis for the termination of commodity supply; (vii)\nthe ESCO has not assigned its right to\nobtain payment of the arrears to an entity that is not a utility for purposes\nof article 2 of the Public Service Law; and\n(viii)\nless than one year has elapsed since\nthe commodity supply was terminated. (2)\n\nThe final notice of suspension from or on\nbehalf of an ESCO shall inform the customer that suspension of the customer's\ndistribution service can accompany the ESCO's commodity termination, even if\nthe customer's account for distribution service is current, and shall state the\namounts which must be paid to: (i) restore\ncommodity supply; and\n(ii)\nif\ndifferent, to end suspension of distribution service. (3)\n\nThe distribution utility shall make its\nbest efforts to institute such suspension of distribution service promptly, consistent with applicable commission policies and practices, and shall receive\nreasonable compensation from the ESCO, as determined by the commission, for any\ncosts associated with such suspension of distribution service. Comment:Distribution utilities are not required to\nduplicate all HEFPA procedures, such as suspension notices, negotiations of\ndeferred payment agreements or other related tasks, when effectuating an\nESCO-intitiated suspension of service; however, the distribution utility must\n(1) determine whether the customer or a resident at the customer's premises\nqualifies for special protections under Public Service Law, section 32(3) and\nsection\n11.5\nof this Part and (2) collect\nfrom the customer, if possible, at the time of suspension, the amount necessary\nto avoid suspension. An ESCO requesting suspension more than 60 days from the\ndate of its original suspension notice to the customer or when suspension does\nnot occur within 60 days from the date of the suspension notice to the\ncustomer, must send another customer suspension notice containing updated\npayment information or it must inform the distribution utility that it no\nlonger seeks to suspend service. Further, when the ESCO seeks suspension of\ndistribution service, two notices are required: (1)\na notice to the customer stating that its\nservice is subject to suspension after 15 days, the amount to be paid to avoid\nsuspension, the amount to be paid to resume service after suspension and, if\ndifferent, the amount necessary to end suspension; and\n(2)\na notice to the utility requesting\nsuspension of the customer's distribution service and certifying that the\nprovisions of Public Service Law, section 32(5) (a) have been\nsatisfied.
