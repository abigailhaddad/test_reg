  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-8.4 - Payroll\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This form\nshould be prepared at the close of each payroll period to support the accounts\npayable voucher drawn for the net amount of the payroll. The payroll itself\nshall be supported by the attendance reports for the pay period. The specimen\nform of payroll, shown as Exhibit 29 of Appendix S-8, reflects a semimonthly\npay period for all employees but may be readily adapted in connection with\nother pay periods. The payroll shall indicate the name of each employee, his\noccupation, or job title, number of hours worked, rate of pay, gross amount\nearned, itemization of all deductions, net amount paid, check number, and\nshould have provision for the employee's signature. Under the Public Housing\n\nLaw, the employee's signature on the payroll or payroll check constitutes an\naccord and satisfaction, unless qualified as having been made under\nprotest. (b) Employee's earnings\nrecords in permanent form showing all payments and deductions, shall be\nmaintained for each employee. In this connection, a payroll system which\npermits posting of individual employee's earnings records as a by-product of\nthe preparation of the payroll is recommended. (c) In preparing the payroll (Exhibit 29, Appendix S-8) it is preferable that management and administrative employees be\nentered first, followed by operating and maintenance employees. Overtime shall\nbe indicated by entries in colored ink, or other means of identification, in\ncolumn 4. At the end of the payroll period, columns 7, 8 and 9 should be\ntotalled at the foot of the form. The total of column 7 of the payroll (amount\nearned) must be in agreement with the total column of the payroll summary\nanalysis (Exhibit 32, Appendix S-8) as evidenced in the specimen form appended. Slight differences may occur at times between the totals reflected in these two\ncolumns due to variances occasioned by the converting of the wages of salaried\nemployees to an hourly basis, in which case adjustments will be necessary. Upon\ncompletion and approval of the payroll form at the end of the payroll period, an accounts payable voucher supported by the payroll is drawn in accordance\nwith paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of section\n1642-2.4. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-8.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
