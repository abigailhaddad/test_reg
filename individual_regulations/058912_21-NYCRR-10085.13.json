In all cases, the water board reserves the right to\nplace a meter upon any premises. The owner, user or tenant, or agent thereof of\nthe premises must provide a suitable place wherein to place the meter. After\nthe meter is so attached, any damage which such meter may sustain, resulting\nfrom the tortious conduct of such owner, user, tenant or agent to properly\nsecure and protect the same, as well as any damage which may result from\nallowing such meter to become frozen or to be injured by hot water or steam\nsettling back from a boiler, shall be paid to the water board on demand. In\ncase payment is not so made, the water shall be shut off and not turned on\nuntil all charges are paid. The water board may sue and collect of the owner, user tenant or agent thereof the amount of such damages in civil action. All\npersons are forbidden to tamper with, knowingly render inaccurate, interfere\nwith or disconnect a water meter from any service after it has been attached to\nany premises. All meters shall be furnished by the water board and remain the\nproperty of the water board. All references to meters shall include the meter, wires and connections thereto. (b) Complaints on meters. In all cases where a complaint is received about meter\nand a service call to the premises where the meter is located is required, the\nperson making the complaint shall make arrangements for access to the meter by\ndepartment personnel at a definite time and date. In the event that department\npersonnel are unable to gain access to the meter at the time and on the date\nspecified, such person shall be liable for the real cost incurred by the water\nboard and the city for such service call. In case payment is not so made, the\nwater shall be shut off and not turned on until all charges are paid. The\ncharge referred to herein shall be made for each time city personnel are unable\nto gain access to a meter after receiving a complaint and making an appointment\nto inspect the meter at the premises in which the meter is located. (c) Entry to premises. The commissioner\nreserves the right to enter, at any reasonable time, and with reasonable\nnotice, any premises where a water meter is installed, for the purpose of\nreading, testing, examining, repairing, removing, replacing or modifying such\nmeter and its appurtenances when, in the opinion of the commissioner, such\naction is necessary. (d) Meters. (1)\n\nAll premises shall be equipped with a\nwater meter to measure all water consumption, unless the commissioner\ndetermines that the placement of a meter in a dwelling or structure is\nimpracticable or impossible. (2)\n\nNo\nmeter will be furnished to any consumer for any purpose except at the minimum\nrates per meter as provided in the board schedule of rates. (3)\n\nIf a meter fails at any time to register\nor inaccurately measures the quantity of water consumed, then such quantity\nshall be determined and the charge will be made based on the average quantity\nregistered during such preceding period of time prior to the date of failure as\nthe commissioner may determine. (4)\n\nIn the event it becomes impossible or impractical to obtain a current reading\nof any meter, for any reason, then the quantity of water consumed during such\ntime shall be determined, and the charge will be made based on the average\nquantity registered during such preceding period of time prior to the date of\nimpossibility or impracticability as the commissioner may determine. (5)\n\nNo deduction may be made from the\ninvoices on account of leakage. (6)\n\nAll defects in meters must be reported to the department for repair or\ncorrection. (7)\n\nAll meters must at\nall times be accessible to the employees of the department for examination and\ninspection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
