  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.45 - Software requirements for percentage payout\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If progressives, bonus systems, merchandise and so on are external to a game's prize pool, the values shall not\nbe included in the percentage-payout calculation. The independent testing\nlaboratory approved by the commission shall provide the minimum and maximum\ntheoretical payout percentage for the game within a certification report, unless otherwise noted. Additional external awards added to a game shall\nrequire a re-evaluation of the theoretical payout percentage, considering the\nvalue of the award and other relevant factors. The independent testing\nlaboratory approved by the commission shall re-evaluate a game's theoretical\npayout percentage when requested. (b) Gaming devices that may be affected by\nplayer skill shall meet the requirement of this section when using a method of\nplay that will provide the greatest return to the player over a period of\ncontinuous play. (c) The minimum\npercentage requirement shall be met when playing at the lowest end of a\nnon-linear pay table (i.e., if a game is continuously played at a minimum bet\nlevel for the cycle of the game and the theoretical return to the player is\nlower than the minimum percentage, then such pay table is not\npermissible). (d) Double-up or\ngamble options shall have a theoretical return to the player of 100\npercent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
