  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 249.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purpose of this regulation, the following\ndefinitions apply: (a) Best Available\n\nRetrofit Technology or BART. An emission limitation based on the degree of\nreduction achievable through the application of the best system of continuous\nemission reduction for each visibility-impairing pollutant which is emitted by\nan existing stationary facility. BART for any individual source is determined\nby undertaking the case-by-case analysis required under section\n249.3\nof this Part. (b) Deciview. A measurement of visibility\nimpairment. A deciview is a haze index derived from calculated light\nextinction, such that uniform changes in haziness correspond to uniform\nincremental changes in perception across the entire range of conditions, from\npristine to highly impaired. The deciview haze index is calculated based on the\nfollowing equation (for the purposes of calculating deciview, the atmospheric\nlight extinction coefficient must be calculated from aerosol measurements): HI = 10 ln (b/10)\n\nWhere b = the atmospheric light extinction coefficient, expressed in inverse megameters (Mm-1). (c) Federal Class I Area. A national park\nwhich exceeds 6,000 acres, national wilderness area which exceeds 5,000 acres, national memorial park which exceeds 5,000 acres, or any international park, which was in existence as of August 7, 1977. (d) In existence. As used in section\n249.1\n(b)(2)\nof\nthis Part, the owner or operator has obtained all necessary preconstruction\napprovals or permits required by Federal, State, or local air pollution\nemissions and air quality laws or regulations and either has: (1)\nbegun, or caused to begin, a continuous\nprogram of physical on-site construction of the facility; or\n(2)\nentered into binding agreements or\ncontractual obligations, which cannot be canceled or modified without\nsubstantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of\nconstruction of the facility to be completed in a reasonable time. (e) Light extinction. The process\nof light being absorbed or scattered as it passes through a medium, such as the\natmosphere. (f) Natural visibility\nconditions. Includes naturally occurring phenomena that reduce visibility as\nmeasured in terms of light extinction, visual range, contrast, or\ncoloration. (g) Reconstruction. Where the fixed capital cost of the new component exceeds 50 percent of the\nfixed capital cost of a comparable entirely new source. Any final decision as\nto whether reconstruction has occurred must be made in accordance with the\nprovisions of\n40 CFR\n60.15(f)(1) through\n(3). (h) Regional haze. Visibility impairment that\nis caused by the emission of visibility-impairing air pollutants from numerous\nsources located over a wide geographic area. (i) Visibility-impairing pollutant. Sulfur\ndioxide (SO\n2\n), nitrogen oxides (NO\nx\n), and particulate matter less than or equal to 10\nmicrons in diameter (PM\n10\n). (j) Visibility impairment. Any humanly\nperceptible change in visibility (light extinction, visual range, contrast, coloration) from that which would have existed under natural\nconditions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n249.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
