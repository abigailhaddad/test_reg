  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2521.3 - Classification of buildings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon\napplication by a tenant or owner, the DHCR shall issue an order determining a\nbuilding's classification based upon the services provided and other relevant\nfactors. Except as provided in subdivisions (c) and (d) of this section, if it\nis determined that such building is not a hotel, the DHCR shall classify the\nbuilding as an apartment building unless the owner restores sufficient services\nto maintain a hotel classification in accordance with subdivision (b) of this\nsection. If the building is reclassified, then the housing accommodations\ntherein shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of this Code applicable\nto apartment buildings, at the legal regulated rent for each housing\naccommodation as determined by the order of the DHCR, plus lawful increases and\nadjustments allowed pursuant to this Code. In order for an owner to retain or\ncontinue the building's classification as a hotel, he or she must provide, in\naddition to any other services he or she is or was providing pursuant to\nsection\n2520.6\n(r) of this\n\nTitle, all four of the following services: (1)\nmaid service, consisting of general\nhousecleaning at a frequency of at least once a week; (2)\nlinen service, consisting of providing\nclean linens at a frequency of at least once a week; (3)\nfurniture and furnishings, including at a\nminimum a bed, lamps, storage facilities for clothing, chair and mirror in a\nbedroom; such furniture to be maintained by the hotel owner in reasonable\ncondition; and\n(4)\nlobby staffed 24\nhours a day, seven days a week by at least one employee. (b) A building's classification as a hotel\nwill not be retained or continued where the DHCR determines that 51 percent of\nthe permanent tenants are not receiving maid and linen service, except that all\ntenants receiving such services shall be entitled to receive the services for\nthe duration of their occupancy. Where an owner is providing maid and linen\nservice to 51 percent of the permanent tenants and the owner wishes to maintain\nthe building's classification as a hotel, the owner shall be afforded 90 days\nto restore all four hotel services described above, without any additional rent\nincrease for such services, to all of the building's permanent tenants, except\nthat those tenants whose housing accommodations were rented to them as\napartment (not hotel) housing accommodations shall have the option of rejecting\nrestoration of hotel services and be subject to the RSL, pursuant to the\nprovisions of this Code applicable to apartment buildings, until they vacate, at which time the owner shall be required to restore hotel services to the\nhousing accommodations. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, single-room\noccupancy facilities such as single-room occupancy hotels or rooming houses, as\ndefined in the MDL, shall not be subject to reclassification pursuant to this\nsection. However, such housing accommodations shall be included in the\ndefinition of hotel as set forth in section\n2520.6\n(b) of this\n\nTitle for all other purposes of this Code, except that the four minimum\nservices enumerated in such section shall not be required to be provided unless\nsuch services were provided on the applicable base dates pursuant to section\n2520.6\n(r)(4)\nof\nthis Title. (d) Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of subdivision (a) of this section, the DHCR may decline to\nreclassify a hotel to apartment building status if it finds that the owner has\nreduced any of the four hotel services listed in such subdivision (a) for the\npurpose of reclassification of the building.
