  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 351.7 - Probation supervision practices\n\nState Regulations\n\nSupervision is the sum of activities of a probation\nofficer(s), or other authorized personnel with a probationer during the term of\nprobation or interim probation supervision and shall include, but is not\nlimited to: (a) Probationer\nengagement. (1)\n\nEngage the probationer\nby using motivational interviewing and other evidence-based tools to prompt an\nunderstanding for the need to change criminal thinking and behavior, and to\nlead a law-abiding life. (2)\n\nDocument in the case file the probationer's progress in changing his/her\nthinking and behavior. (3)\n\nAdvocate\nfor the probationer's timely commencement of services and work closely through\non-going communication with the service provider(s) and monitor the\nprobationer's motivation, participation, and progress in services that address\nthe criminogenic needs identified in the case plan. (4)\n\nDocument in the case file the\nprobationer's initiation of services. (b) Probationer referrals and\nservices. (1)\n\nAdvocate for the\nprobationer's timely commencement of services and work closely, through\non-going communication, with the service provider(s) to monitor a probationer's\nparticipation and progress in completing the services that address the\ncriminogenic needs identified in the case plan. (2)\n\nDocument in the case file the\nprobationer's participation in services, the nature of their progress, and\ncompletion of services. (3)\n\nProbation officers shall refer probationers and/or their families to services\navailable in the community. Probation officer efforts to engage probationers\nand to manage service referrals are intended to increase probationer\nmotivation, identify incentives and/or barriers for behavior change, and help\nthe probationer find solutions to reduce resistance to change. (4)\n\nProbation officers should be\nknowledgeable of the services that are available in the jurisdiction and, based\non information from the assessment and case plan, shall match the probationer\nto services that can specifically address the targeted criminogenic\nneeds. (5)\n\nProbationers with higher\nrisk and needs shall be referred, if available, to more intensive interventions\nwhich target those risk and needs. (6)\n\nProbation officers shall provide\ninformation to the service provider about the probationer's criminogenic needs\nso that services may be more targeted to those criminogenic needs. (c) Risk management. The utilization of accountability measures, including\ngraduated sanctions, in probation supervision shall include: (1)\nmonitoring the probationer's activities\nand behaviors-tracking the \"what, when, where, and with whom\" of the\nprobationer's behavior; (2)\nperiodically reviewing the conditions of probation and case plan with the\nprobationer, being clear, explicit, and specific in expectations; and\n(3)\ndocumenting information in the case\nrecord which is important and that may be needed in a future proceeding, in\naccordance with Part 348 of this Title. (d) Risk reduction. Providing direction, support, and services to the\nprobationer facilitates change that contributes to lawful behavior, and may\ninclude: (1)\nutilizing and\nperiodically reviewing assessment information to determine level of supervision\nand criminogenic needs; (2)\n\nReviewing and documenting stages of change, participation in services, and\nprogress in addressing criminogenic needs. (3)\nreviewing probationer achievements and\nchallenges and modifying the case plan; (4)\nusing incentives to recognize compliance\nwith conditions of probation or achievement of case plan goals, including merit\ncredit activities; (5)\nauthorizing\nmerit credit, where the probationer has complied with the conditions of\nprobation and the case plan, and has engaged in merit credit\nactivities; (6)\nusing graduated\nsanctions when the probationer is non-compliant; (7)\nresponding to probationer positive and\nnegative behavior change swiftly, consistently, predictably, and\nproportionately; or\n(8)\nmodifying\nconditions of probation. Requests for modification of conditions of probation shall\nbe pursuant to the following procedures: (i) In accordance with departmental policies, the probation officer shall draft suggested revisions to the conditions of\nprobation, specifically stating which of the original terms are to be modified\nor enlarged, or new terms added. (ii)\n\nThe probation officer shall submit the\nproposed revision to the court with a covering memorandum indicating specific\nrationale for the modification or enlargement and request, if necessary, a\ncourt appearance for the probationer to effect these changes. (iii)\n\nIf the modification of the conditions\nconsists solely of the elimination or relaxation of one or more conditions, the\nprobationer shall not be required to appear in court and shall be so advised\nunless the court directs otherwise. If the modification of the conditions\nconsists of an enlargement of the conditions, the probationer shall be required\nto appear in court. (iv)\n\nUpon a\nprobation officer's notification of the court's approval of the modification or\nenlargement of the terms and conditions of probation, the probation officer\nshall review all of the current terms and conditions with the\nprobationer. (e) Technology. Various technologies may be used as a form of communication\nbetween probation officers and probationers, where approved and applicable, pursuant to existing department policies. Certain technology, for example\nignition interlock devices, global positioning systems, and computer searches, may be required by law or court order as part of probation supervision. Technology may be utilized to enhance supervision skills and strategies, but it\nis not a replacement for probation supervision. Technology alone will not\nchange probationer behavior unless coupled with effective assessment, case\nplanning, services, incentives and graduated sanctions. Technology enhanced\nsupervision may be used when feasible with all levels of probation supervision. Where applicable, existing probation department written policies shall reflect\nhow technology may be used in probation supervision. (f) Supervisory\ndirectives/instructions. Courts are required to impose specific conditions related\nto probation supervision and others as required by law. These conditions of\nprobation are relative to conduct, rehabilitation, movement, and controls, so\nas to ensure that the probationer being supervised will lead a law-abiding life\nor assist him/her in doing so, or to ameliorate the conduct which gave rise to\nthe term of probation. Each probation director may establish written policies\nproviding that supervisory directives and/or instructions are required for the\nprobationer to follow as part of his/her respective supervision plan. Any\ndirectives and/or instructions shall be reviewed and approved by a supervisor\nwithin the department. Such directives or instructions shall relate to and\nclarify any general or specific conditions of probation imposed by the court\nrelative to conduct, rehabilitation, movement, controls, assessment, needs, or\nclassification relevant to the supervision plan of the probationer. The\nprobationer shall be given written documentation of any such directives or\ninstructions and the probation officer shall review its content with the\nprobationer to ensure that he/she is aware of and understands the supervisory\nrequirements. The probationer shall sign an acknowledgement that the\nsupervisory directive(s) has been provided and explained. Supervisory\ndirectives/instructions may apply to interstate cases where probation has\nauthority to impose probation conditions. (g) Victims services. Probation departments shall refer victims of crime to\nservices in the community where available. Probation departments may provide\nservices to victims, including: (1)\nrestitution collection and disbursement; (2)\nvictim notification; (3)\nhelping victims complete applications for\nvictim compensation; (4)\noffering\nor referring for victim/offender mediation; (5)\noffering or referring for victim impact\npanels; or\n(6)\nresponding to victim\ninquiries regarding information about a probationer's status on probation, where allowed by law.
