(b) Nondestructive testing of\nwelds must be performed in accordance with written procedures and by persons\nwho have been trained and qualified in the established procedures and with the\nequipment employed in testing. (c) Procedures must be established for the proper interpretation of each\nnondestructive test of a weld to ensure the acceptability of the weld under\nsection\n255.241\n(c) of\nthis Part.
