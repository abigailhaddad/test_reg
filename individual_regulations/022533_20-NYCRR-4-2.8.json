  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.8 - Net interest income from reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(5)(a)(2)(E))\n(a) 8% of net interest income (not less than\nzero) from reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements is\nincluded in New York receipts. Net interest income (not less than zero) from\nreverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements is included\nin everywhere receipts. (b) Net\ninterest income from reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing\nagreements is determined for purposes of this section after the deduction of\nthe interest expense from the corporation's repurchase agreements and\nsecurities lending agreements, but cannot be less than zero. For this\ncalculation, the amount of such interest expense is the interest expense\nassociated with the sum of the value of the corporation's repurchase agreements\nwhere it is the seller/borrower plus the value of the corporation's securities\nlending agreements where it is the securities lender, provided such sum is\nlimited to the sum of the value of the corporation's reverse repurchase\nagreements where it is the purchaser/lender plus the value of the corporation's\nsecurities lending agreements where it is the securities borrower. (c) Example. Corporation A has $4,000 of interest income from reverse\nrepurchase agreements and $5,000 of interest expense from repurchase\nagreements. Corporation A also has $6,000 of interest income from securities\nborrowing agreements and $3,000 of interest expense from securities lending\nagreements for the same year. To determine the amount of net interest income\nfrom these transactions, Corporation A must reduce the sum of the interest\nincome from reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements\nby the sum of the interest expense from repurchase agreements and securities\nlending agreements. The result is $2,000 ($4,000 + $6,000 - $5,000 -$3,000) of\nnet interest income from reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements\nthat is included in everywhere receipts. Corporation A must also report $160\n(8% of $2,000) in New York receipts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
