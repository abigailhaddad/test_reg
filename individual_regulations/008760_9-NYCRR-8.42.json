  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8.42 - Executive Order No. 42: Establishing the New York Health Benefit Exchange\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the implementation of a Health Benefit Exchange\nand other reforms in New York will: (1)\nresult in lower premiums for individuals\nand small businesses; (2)\nallow\nindividuals and small businesses purchasing coverage through such Exchange to\nreceive $2.6 billion in federal tax credits and cost sharing subsidies; and\n(3)\nprovide one million additional\n\nNew Yorkers access to affordable, comprehensive health insurance, reducing the\npercentage of New Yorkers who are without health insurance; WHEREAS, a state that chooses to operate its own Exchange\nmust demonstrate to the federal government, by January 1, 2013, that its\n\nExchange will be able to begin accepting applications by October 1, 2013, and\nwill be operational by January 1, 2014, and if the state does not demonstrate\noperational readiness of its own Exchange, its residents will be required to\nparticipate in a federal Exchange; WHEREAS, the State of New York is best positioned to: (1)\nunderstand the ramifications of\noperating an Exchange within New York's commercial insurance market; (2)\nconsider the unique regional and economic\nneeds of the State's individual and small business health insurance markets; (3)\naccount for the diversity of\nits population, with its ethnic, cultural and language differences; and\n(4)\ndecide what benefits will be\nprovided to enrollees in the Exchange, which health plans can participate in\nthe Exchange, what rules should apply to the marketing of products by health\nplans, and how to operate the Small Business Health Option Program (\"SHOP\") for\nsmall businesses; WHEREAS, the Affordable Care Act requires an Exchange to\nevaluate the eligibility of individuals for Medicaid and other public health\ncoverage and enroll them if eligible, meaning that it will be essential to\ncoordinate the operations of the Exchange with the State's administration of\nthese programs; WHEREAS, the taxpayers of this State subsidize the costs\nassociated with care for the 2.7 million New Yorkers without health insurance, who frequently forego preventive care and other needed treatment, putting them\nat risk of being sicker throughout their lives and dying sooner than those who\nhave health insurance, which diverts funds from other public uses and costs\nstate and county taxpayers more than $600 million annually just to pay for a\nportion of the services rendered by hospitals to people without\ninsurance; WHEREAS, New York's uninsured working families often earn\ntoo much to qualify for public health insurance, but not enough to purchase\ncoverage that costs, on average, over $1,200 per month for an individual and\n$3,450 per month for a family of four; WHEREAS, small businesses, without assistance, cannot\nafford to purchase health insurance coverage for their workers, nearly 800,000\nof whom have lost employer-sponsored coverage over the last decade, and thus\nface a major competitive disadvantage that inhibits their ability to grow, create jobs and otherwise support the State's economic development; WHEREAS, the costs associated with care for the uninsured\nare shifted through increased premiums to those individuals and groups that\npurchase health insurance coverage, causing working families with health\ninsurance to pay $800 more in premiums on average each year; WHEREAS, the development and operation of an Exchange in\n\nNew York will impose no cost on the State, but will be funded entirely with\nfederal funds until January 1, 2015, at which time the Exchange will be wholly\nself-funded, meaning that no State or county taxpayer dollars will be used for\nsuch purposes; and\nWHEREAS, it is therefore critical that the State of New\n\nYork establish and operate its own Exchange, and that it do so\nexpeditiously; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Andrew M. Cuomo, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nthe Laws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1. There is hereby established within the\n\nDepartment of Health, in conformity with the Affordable Care Act, the New York\n\nHealth Benefit Exchange (the \"Exchange\").

The Exchange shall, among other things, facilitate enrollment in health coverage and the purchase and sale of qualified\nhealth plans in the individual market in this state, and enroll individuals in\nhealth coverage for which they are eligible in accordance with federal\nlaw. 3. The Exchange shall, among\nother things, take such actions necessary to enable eligible individuals to\nreceive premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions and to enable eligible\nsmall businesses to receive tax credits, in compliance with all applicable\nfederal and state laws and regulations. 4. The Exchange shall, among other things, enter into agreements with appropriate entities, including but not limited to\nfederal, state and local agencies, to the extent necessary to carry out its\nduties and responsibilities, provided that such agreements incorporate adequate\nprotections with respect to the confidentiality of any information to be\nshared. 5. The Exchange shall, among other things, convene regional advisory committees, consisting of\nconsumer advocates, small business consumer representatives, health care\nproviders, agents, brokers, insurers, labor organizations, and any other\nappropriate stakeholders, to provide advice and make recommendations on the\nestablishment and operation of the Exchange, including recommendations about\nrelevant regional factors, and shall provide opportunities for public input on\nsuch matters. 6. The Exchange\nshall, among other things, become financially self-sustaining by January 1, 2015, as required by the Affordable Care Act. 7. Nothing in this Order shall be construed\nto duplicate, preempt, supersede, limit or otherwise restrict the statutory\nauthority, duties and functions of the Department of Health, the Department of\n\nFinancial Services or any other agency of this State.
