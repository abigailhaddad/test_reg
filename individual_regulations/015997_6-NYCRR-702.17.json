  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 702.17 - Variances to effluent limitations based on standards and guidance values\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department\nmay grant, to an applicant for a SPDES permit or to a SPDES permittee, a\nvariance to a water quality-based effluent limitation or groundwater effluent\nlimitation included in a SPDES permit. (1)\nA\nvariance applies only to the permittee identified in such variance and only to\nthe pollutant specified in the variance. A variance does not affect or require\nthe department to modify a corresponding standard or guidance value. A variance\ndoes not affect or require the department to modify a corresponding groundwater\neffluent limitation for the groundwater as a whole. (2)\nA variance shall not apply to a new or\nrecommencing discharger in the Great Lakes System unless the proposed discharge\nis a temporary one that is necessary to alleviate an imminent and substantial\ndanger to the public health or the environment that is greater than the danger\nfrom not achieving the standard or guidance value. For the purpose of this\n\nPart, an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or the\nenvironment shall include, but not be limited to, a significant threat to the\nenvironment as defined in Part 375 of this Title. (3)\nA variance shall not be granted that\nwould likely jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened\nspecies or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such species'\ncritical habitat. (4)\nA variance\nshall not be granted if standards or guidance values will be attained by\nimplementing effluent limits required under section\n750-1.11\n(a) of\nthis Title and by the permittee implementing cost-effective and reasonable best\nmanagement practices for nonpoint source control. (5)\nA variance term shall not exceed the term\nof the SPDES permit. Where the term of the variance is the same as the permit, the variance shall stay in effect until the permit is reissued, modified or\nrevoked. (b) A variance\nmay be granted if the requester demonstrates that achieving the effluent\nlimitation is not feasible because: (1)\nnaturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent attainment of the standard\nor guidance value; (2)\nnatural, ephemeral, intermittent or low flow conditions or water levels prevent\nattainment, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of\nsufficient volume of effluent to enable the standard or guidance value to be\nmet without violating water conservation requirements; (3)\nhuman-caused conditions or sources of\npollution prevent attainment of the standard or guidance value and cannot be\nremedied or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in\nplace; (4)\ndams, diversions or\nother types of hydrologic modifications preclude attainment of the standard or\nguidance value, and it is not feasible to restore the waterbody to its original\ncondition or to operate such modification in a way that would result in such\nattainment; (5)\nphysical conditions\nrelated to the natural features of the waterbody, such as the lack of a proper\nsubstrate cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like, unrelated to\nchemical water quality, preclude attainment of the standard or guidance value; or\n(6)\ncontrols more stringent than\nthose required by section\n750-1.11\n(a) of\nthis Title would result in substantial and widespread economic and social\nimpact. (c) In addition\nto the requirements of subdivision (b) of this section, the requestor shall\nalso characterize, using adequate and sufficient data and principles, any\nincreased risk to human health and the environment associated with granting the\nvariance compared with attainment of the standard or guidance value absent the\nvariance, and demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that the risk\nwill not adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. (d) The requestor shall submit a written\napplication for a variance to the department. The application shall include: (1)\nall relevant information demonstrating\nthat achieving the effluent limitation is not feasible based on subdivision (b)\nof this section; and\n(2)\nall\nrelevant information demonstrating compliance with the conditions in\nsubdivision (c) of this section. (e) Where a request for a variance satisfies\nthe requirements of this section, the department shall authorize the variance\nthrough the SPDES permit. The variance request shall be available to the public\nfor review during the public notice period for the permit. The permit shall\ncontain all conditions needed to implement the variance. Such conditions shall, at minimum, include: (1)\ncompliance with an\ninitial effluent limitation that, at the time the variance is granted, represents the level currently achievable by the requestor, and that is no less\nstringent than that achieved under the previous permit where\napplicable; (2)\nthat reasonable\nprogress be made toward achieving the effluent limitation based on the standard\nor guidance value, including, where reasonable, an effluent limitation more\nstringent than the initial effluent limitation; (3)\nadditional monitoring, biological studies\nand pollutant minimization measures as deemed necessary by the\ndepartment; (4)\nwhen the duration\nof a variance is shorter than the duration of a permit, compliance with an\neffluent limitation sufficient to meet the underlying standard or guidance\nvalue, upon the expiration of the variance; and\n(5)\na provision that allows the department to\nreopen and modify the permit for revisions to the variance. (f) The department shall deny a\nvariance request if the requestor fails to make the demonstrations required\nunder subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section. (g) A variance may be renewed, subject to the\nrequirements of this section. As part of any renewal application, the permittee\nshall again demonstrate that achieving the effluent limitation is not feasible\nbased on the requirements of this section. The permittee's application shall\nalso contain information concerning its compliance with the conditions\nincorporated into its permit as part of the original variance pursuant to\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section. Renewal of a variance may be denied\nif the permittee did not comply with the conditions of the original\nvariance. (h) Where the department\ndetermines that a multiple discharge variance is necessary to address\nwidespread standard or guidance value attainment issues including the presence\nof a ubiquitous pollutant or naturally high levels of a pollutant in a\nwatershed, the department, in lieu of the discharger, may conduct the variance\ndemonstration requirements in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section. Any\npermittee accepting such variance shall be subject to the provisions of\nsubdivision (e) of this section. (i) The department will make available to the\npublic a list of every variance that has been granted and that remains in\neffect. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n702.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
