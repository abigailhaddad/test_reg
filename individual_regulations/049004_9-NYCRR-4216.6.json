  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4216.6 - Parlay betting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When\nconsistent with the public interest and the best interests of racing generally, with permission of the commission, the track operator may offer parlay betting\nas a service to the betting public. (b) The parlay is not a pari-mutuel pool, but\nis a series of bets combining betting entries in win, place or show pools in\neach of two or more separate races in chronological order. The initial amount\nbet constitutes the bet on the first betting entry in the first parlay race\n(leg); if successful, the payoff from winning the first leg (to the lowest\npenny) is then bet on the betting entry designated in the second leg; if again\nsuccessful, and if the parlay continues, the payoff from winning the second leg\nis then bet (to the lowest penny) in the third leg; etc. (c) A parlay bet may combine any of the races\non the program and must combine at least two and not over six races. Bets are\nlimited to win, place or show pool types for which a corresponding pool is\nconducted on the race selected. The races in a parlay must be chronological but\nneed not be consecutive nor combine the same type pool. The parlay shall be\ndesignated on one pari-mutuel ticket which may also evidence other parlay bets\ncombining the same races. (d) A\nparlay bet may not combine bets in the same race or earlier races (so-called\nreverse bets) nor on races on other programs. (e) While payoffs inserted as bets in\nsubsequent races are broken to the lowest penny (unlike regular payoffs), payoffs to the parlay bettor shall be broken to the lowest dime. Resulting\nparlay breakage shall be reported separately and added to regular breakage at\nthe end of the program for the purpose of taxation and distribution. (f) Parlay payoffs will be so inserted as\nbets in subsequent pools by the track operator that the amount of such bets, including their effect on the betting odds, will be displayed as soon as\npossible after the initial change of the morning line display. (Bet totals in\nsuch pools shall be displayed in truncated fashion, to the lowest\ndollar.)\n(g) If any taxing\nauthority requires the withholding of any portion of a winning parlay payoff\nprior to the completion of all bets in the parlay, such parlay shall thereupon\nterminate at such point and be payable to the ticket holder without further\ncompletion, selections in future races being voided. Such consequence shall be\npublicly announced and prominently displayed by the track operator who shall\ninform the public by explanation and examples of the operation of this\nsubdivision before the start of the racing program. (h) Parlay wagers may be cancelled by the\nticket holder, in accordance with track policy on cancellations, only prior to\nthe start of the first parlay race in which a parlay selection starts. Thereafter, the parlay must either be completed or be terminated by operation\nof these rules in order to be entitled to a payoff. The holder of the parlay\nticket shall not have the option to cash in such bet prior to completion after\na designated parlay entry actually starts in a race. (i) If a race, pool or betting entry in a\nparlay is scratched (which includes an entry being declared a nonstarter for\nbetting purposes, or a race or pool being declared \"off\") the parlay shall be\nconstituted by the remaining legs; if there are no remaining legs, the parlay\nterminates. (j) A bet on a coupled\nentry or field is considered a bet on the remaining part of such coupled entry\nor field in the event any part of such entry or field starts for pari-mutuel\npurposes in accordance with section\n4215.19\nof this Title. Parlay\ntickets incorporating an entry or field in which a scratch occurs are\nrefundable only in accordance with subdivision (h) of this section. (k) Copies of this section shall be made\navailable to the public by the track operator. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
