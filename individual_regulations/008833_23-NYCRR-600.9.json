  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23 § 600.9 - Sales-based financing-opt-in method\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nsection shall apply only to sales-based financing utilizing the opt-in method\nas described in Financial Services Law section 803. (b) With respect to any assumptions about a\nrecipient's future sales, income or receipts, and as an alternative to the\nmethods described in section\n600.8\nof this Part for calculating\ndisclosures required by this Part, a provider may elect to calculate the\nrequired disclosures in accordance with this section. (c) A provider shall calculate the\ndisclosures using an internal estimated sales projection through the particular\npayment channel or mechanism designated in the contract. (d) The internal estimated sales projection\nthrough the particular payment channel or mechanism shall be calculated using\nthe best information reasonably available to the provider. (e) Once every twelve months, a provider who\nmakes disclosures based upon internal estimated sales projections shall conduct\nan internal audit of its commercial financings. The audit shall cover all\nsales-based financings paid off during the previous twelve-month period where\nthe provider made disclosures based upon internal estimated sales projections, including transactions with contractually required true-up payments, but\nexcluding transactions where: (1)\nthe\nprovider or financer initiated legal action against the recipient in court or\narbitration for breach of the contract or to collect amounts due under the\ncontract; (2)\nthe provider or\nfinancer stopped collection of amounts due under a contract after determining\nthat the recipient had violated the terms of the contract; or\n(3)\nthe provider modified the contract terms\npursuant to an agreement with a recipient. (f) The provider shall calculate the\nretrospective annual percentage rate for each sales-based financing in the\naudit. With respect to financing where a lump sum payment is used to pay off\nthe financing faster than required by the contract, a provider may calculate\nthe retrospective annual percentage rate by ignoring the lump sum payment and\nassuming that the contract would have been repaid in periodic payments that are\nan average of the past periodic payments under the contract. (g) The provider shall calculate the\npercentage of the difference between the disclosed annual percentage rate and\nthe retrospective annual percentage rate for each sales-based financing in the\naudit. The provider shall subtract the disclosed annual percentage rate from\nthe retrospective annual percentage rate for each sales-based financing in the\naudit, divide the resulting amount by the disclosed annual percentage rate, and\nmultiply that number by 100. The percentage resulting from this calculation\nshall be called the \"APR spread.\"\n(h) The provider shall find the median APR\nspread for all sales-based financings in the audit. The median shall be called\nthe \"audited APR spread.\"\n(i) After\ncompleting its audit, the provider shall calculate the weighted average of the\naudited APR spreads for the last three audits, the last five audits, and the\nlast seven audits using the total number of transactions used to calculate the\naudited APR spreads for each audit period. A provider is not required to\ncalculate a weighted average for the last three audits if the provider has not\nconducted three audits, the weighted average for the last five audits if the\nprovider has not conducted five audits, or the weighted average for the last\nseven audits if the provider has not conducted seven audits. (1)\n\nIf the weighted average for the last\nthree audits is greater than 15 percent, the provider shall not utilize the\nmethod described in this subdivision (i) to calculate the required disclosure\nterms for 24 months, but shall instead employ the methods described in section\n600.8\nunless the provider\ndetermines that the method described in section\n600.8\nwould have yielded a higher\nweighted average. (2)\n\nIf the\nweighted average for the last five audits is greater than 10 percent, the\nprovider shall not utilize the method described in this subdivision to\ncalculate the required disclosure terms for 24 months, but shall instead employ\nthe method described in section\n600.8\nunless the provider\ndetermines that the method described in section\n600.8\nwould have yielded a higher\nweighted average. (3)\n\nIf the\nweighted average for the last seven audits is greater than five percent, the\nprovider shall not utilize the method described in this subdivision to\ncalculate the required disclosure terms for 24 months, but shall instead employ\nthe method described in section\n600.8\nunless the provider\ndetermines that the method described in section\n600.8\nwould have yielded a higher\nweighted average. (j) Following the end of the 24-month period described in subdivision (i) of this\nsection, the provider may begin calculating estimated payments, and term and\nannual percentage rates in accordance with this section only if the provider\nhas made a good-faith effort to modify its method for calculating internal\nestimated sales projections to make its disclosures more accurate. (k) If a provider must make additional\nestimates or assumptions other than an estimate of a recipient's future sales, income or receipts in order to provide disclosures required by this Part, the\nprovider shall: (1)\nbase those estimates or\nassumptions on the best information reasonably available to the provider at the\ntime of the disclosure; (2)\nstate\nclearly that any disclosure based upon an estimate or assumption is an estimate\nby adding the word \"estimate\" to the descriptive language of any required\ndisclosure under this Part; and\n(3)\nstate clearly any assumptions or estimates used as the basis for the disclosure\nin any description associated with the disclosure.
