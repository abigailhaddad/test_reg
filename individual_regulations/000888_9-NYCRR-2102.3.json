  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2102.3 - Grounds for increase of maximum rent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThis section sets forth specific\nstandards for the increase of a maximum rent. In applying these standards and\nentering an order adjusting a maximum rent, the Administrator shall take into\nconsideration all factors bearing on the equities involved, subject to the\ngeneral limitation that the adjustment can be put into effect without\ndislocation and hardship inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. (2)\n\nThe Administrator shall have the power to\nrevoke or modify any adjustment granted hereunder if there has been a\nsubstantial change in the basis upon which such adjustment was\ngranted. (3)\n\nNo landlord shall be\nentitled to any increase in the maximum rent under this section unless the\nlandlord certifies that it is maintaining all essential services provided or\nrequired to be provided with the housing accommodations involved as of the date\nof the issuance of the order adjusting the maximum rent and that it will\ncontinue to maintain such services so long as the increase in such maximum rent\ncontinues in effect; nor shall any landlord be entitled to any increase in the\nmaximum rent in any case where a municipal department having jurisdiction\ncertifies that the housing accommodation is a fire hazard, or is in a continued\ndangerous condition or detrimental to life or health, or is occupied in\nviolation of law. (4)\n\nThe total of\nall adjustments for any individual housing accommodation granted under\nsubdivisions (g) and (i) of this section shall not exceed 15 per cent for any\n12-month period, except as provided in paragraph (4) of subdivision (g) of this\nsection. (5)\n\nThat portion of the\namount of increase computed under subdivisions (g), (h) and (i) of this section\nas is properly attributable to the controlled housing accommodations shall be\napportioned among them so that each bears an equitable portion thereof. In\nmaking such apportionment and in fixing the increases in maximum rents the\n\nAdministrator shall give due consideration to all previous adjustments or\nincreases in maximum rents by lease or otherwise. Each controlled housing\naccommodation shall bear no more than that portion of the amount of increase as\nis properly attributable to such housing accommodation, whether or not the\namount so attributed shall be fully collectible by reason of existing\nlease. (b) Individual\n\nApartment Improvements (\"IAI\"). (1)\n\nIncrease\nin space, new equipment, new furniture or furnishings; and other\nadjustments. (2)\n\nAn owner is\nentitled to a temporary rent increase where there has been a reasonable and\nverifiable modification, other than an increase for which an adjustment may be\nclaimed pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section, of dwelling space, installation of new equipment or improvements, or new furniture or furnishings, provided in or to the tenant's housing accommodation, where the tenant has\nagreed to such modification or increase and the owner has obtained written\ninformed tenant consent to such rent increase. In the case of vacant housing\naccommodations, tenant consent shall not be required. (i) For all work that commenced on or after\n\nJune 14, 2019, notification of all modifications must be submitted to DHCR for\nverification. As a part of such verification, an owner shall: (a) Provide a copy of the written informed\ntenant consent on an approved DHCR form when tenant consent is\nrequired. (b) Provide the DHCR with\nan itemized list of work performed, including a description and/or explanation\nof the reason or purpose for such work. (c) Provide the DHCR with photographs of the\nsubject apartment where the work will be completed taken prior to such\nmodification or increase as well as photographs taken after, and showing, the\nwork has been completed. Such photographs must be kept as part of the owner's\npermanent records such that the owner must at any future time produce such\nphotographs upon request by an agency with appropriate jurisdiction. (d) Use a licensed contractor to complete\nsuch work. The costs for an individual apartment improvement paid to a person\nor organization contracted to do the improvement or installation work sharing a\ncommon ownership with the owner or managing agent of the subject building or\napartment will be disallowed. (e) Resolve, within the dwelling space, all outstanding hazardous and immediately\nhazardous violations. In no event shall an owner be permitted to begin\ncollection of any rent increase pursuant to this subdivision while there are\nany hazardous or immediately hazardous violations of the Uniform Fire\n\nPrevention and Building Code (Uniform Code), local Fire Code, or local Building\nand Housing Maintenance Codes pending against the affected housing\naccommodation. (ii)\n\nFor\nwork commenced on or after June 14, 2019, the recoverable costs incurred by the\nowner pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to a total aggregate cost\nof fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) that may be expended on no more than\nthree (3) separate individual apartment improvements in any fifteen (15) year\nperiod. (iii)\n\nAn owner who is\nentitled to a temporary rent increase pursuant to this subdivision shall not be\nentitled to a further rent increase based upon the installation of similar\nequipment, or new furniture or furnishings within the useful life of such new\nequipment, or new furniture or furnishings. (iv)\n\nAny increases to the maximum rent\npursuant to this subdivision shall be temporary and shall be removed from the\nmaximum rent thirty (30) years from the date the increase became effective\ninclusive of any increases granted by the applicable local Rent Guidelines\n\nBoard that had been calculated based upon such rent increase. (v) For individual apartment improvements\npursuant to this subdivision, the DHCR shall maintain an itemized list of work\nperformed and a description or explanation of the reason or purpose of such\nwork, inclusive of photographic evidence documenting the condition prior to and\nafter the completion of the performed work. Such documentation and any other\nsupporting documentation shall be submitted to the DHCR by the owner within\nninety (90) days of the completion of the work, retained in a centralized\nelectronic retention system and made available in cases pertaining to the\nadjustment of maximum rents. (vi)\n\nWhere an owner seeks a temporary individual apartment improvement rent increase\npursuant to this subdivision while the unit is occupied, the DHCR shall provide\na form for use by the owner, to obtain written informed consent from the tenant\nthat shall include the estimated total cost of the improvement and the\nestimated monthly rent increase. Such form shall be completed and submitted to\nthe DHCR by the owner within ninety (90) days of the completion of the work and\npreserved in a centralized electronic retention system. Nothing herein shall\nrelieve an owner, lessor, or agent thereof of his or her duty to retain proper\ndocumentation of all improvements performed or any rent increases resulting\nfrom said improvements. (vii)\n\nFor\nrent increases pursuant to this subdivision that took effect prior to June 14, 2019, the increase in the monthly maximum rent for the affected housing\naccommodations when authorized pursuant to this paragraph shall for buildings\nand complexes containing 35 or fewer housing accommodations be 1/40th of the\ntotal cost, including installation but excluding finance charges; and for\nbuildings and complexes containing more than 35 housing accommodations be\n1/60th of the total cost, including installation but excluding finance\ncharges. (viii)\n\nFor temporary rent\nincreases pursuant to this subdivision effective as of or after June 14, 2019, the temporary increase in the monthly maximum rent for the affected housing\naccommodations when authorized pursuant to this paragraph shall for buildings\nand complexes containing 35 or fewer housing accommodations be 1/168th of the\ntotal cost, including the cost of installation but excluding finance charges; and for buildings and complexes containing more than 35 housing accommodations\nbe 1/180th of the total cost, including the cost of installation but excluding\nfinance charges. (c) There has been since March 1, 1950 an\nincrease in the rental value of the housing accommodations as a result of a\nsubstantial rehabilitation of the building or housing accommodations therein\nwhich materially adds to the value the property or appreciably prolongs its\nlife, excluding ordinary repairs, maintenance and replacements. (d) Temporary major capital improvement rent\nadjustments. (1)\n\nAn owner of a building or\nbuilding complex that contains more than thirty-five (35) percent\nrent-regulated units may file an application to temporarily increase the\nmaximum rents of the building or building complex on forms prescribed by the\nDHCR which includes an itemized list of work performed and a description or\nexplanation of the reason or purpose of such work, on one or more of the\nfollowing grounds: (i) There has been a major\ncapital improvement, including an installation, which must meet all of the\nfollowing criteria: (a) it is deemed\ndepreciable under the Internal Revenue Code, other than for ordinary\nrepairs; (b) it is essential for\nthe preservation, energy efficiency, functionality or infrastructure of the\nentire building, including heating, windows, plumbing and roofing, but shall\nnot be for operational costs or unnecessary cosmetic improvements; (c) it is an improvement to the building or\nto the building complex which inures directly or indirectly to the benefit of\nall tenants, and which includes the same work performed in all similar\ncomponents of the building or building complex, unless the owner can\nsatisfactorily demonstrate to the DHCR that certain of such similar components\ndid not require improvement; and\n(d) the item being replaced meets the\nrequirements set forth on the following useful life schedule, except with DHCR\napproval of a waiver, as set forth in clause (e) of this subparagraph.

(e) (1)\n\nAn\nowner who wishes to request a waiver of the useful life requirement set forth\nin clause (d) of this subparagraph must apply to the DHCR for such waiver prior\nto the commencement of the work for which he or she will be seeking a temporary\nmajor capital improvement rental increase. Notwithstanding this requirement, where the waiver requested is for an item being replaced because of an\nemergency, which causes the building or any part thereof to be dangerous to\nhuman life and safety or detrimental to health, an owner may apply to the DHCR\nfor such waiver at the time he or she submits the temporary major capital\nimprovement rent increase application. (2)\n\nIf the waiver is denied, the owner will\nnot be eligible for a temporary major capital improvement increase. However, if\nthe waiver is granted, the useful life requirement will not be a factor in the\ndetermination of eligibility for the temporary major capital improvement rent\nincrease. Approval of the waiver does not assure that the application will be\ngranted, as all other requirements set forth in this subdivision must be\nmet. (3)\n\nAn owner may apply for, and the DHCR may grant, a waiver of the useful life requirements set forth in\nthe Useful Life Schedule, if the owner satisfactorily demonstrates the\nexistence of one or more of the following circumstances: (i) The item or equipment cannot be repaired\nand must be replaced during its useful life because of a fire, vandalism or\nother emergency, or \"act of God\" resulting in an emergency; (ii)\n\nThe item or equipment needs to be\nreplaced because such item or equipment is beyond repair, or spare parts are no\nlonger available, or required repairs would cost more than seventy-five (75)\npercent of the cost of the total replacement of the item or equipment. Certification by a duly licensed engineer or architect, where there is no\ncommon ownership or other financial interest with the owner, shall be\nconsidered substantial proof of such condition(s). The owner may also be\nrequired to submit proof that the item or equipment was properly maintained. Such proof may include receipts for repairs and parts or maintenance\nlogs; (iii)\n(A)\n\nAn appropriate New York State or local\ngovernmental agency has determined that the item or equipment needs to be\nreplaced as part of a government housing program; (B)\n\nIf a governmental lender or insurer, for\nthe purposes of qualifying for a New York State or local government long-term\nloan or insured loan, requires the remaining useful life of the building or\nbuilding complex, as well as the component parts of such building or building\ncomplex, to be as great as or greater than the term of the loan\nagreement. (iv)\n\nThe\nreplacement of an item or equipment which has proven inadequate, through no\nfault of the owner, is necessary, provided that there has been no major capital\nimprovement rent increase for that item or equipment being replaced. (4)\n\nIn the event that the DHCR\ndetermines that an installation qualifies for a waiver of the useful life\nrequirements, the DHCR may, subject to all other requirements of this section, and the limitations of the reasonable cost schedule provisions in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision: (i) Where no previous\nincrease was granted within the useful life of the item or equipment being\nreplaced, approve one-hundred (100) percent of the actual, reasonable, and\nverifiable cost of the item or equipment, including installation; (ii)\n\nWhere it is determined that an item is\neligible to be replaced during its useful life, grant a temporary increase\nbased on the actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost of the item or equipment, including installation, less both (a) the amount reimbursed from other sources, such as insurance proceeds or any other form of commercial guarantee, and (b)\nthe amount of any increase previously granted for the same item or equipment\neither as a major capital improvement, or pursuant to other governmental\nprograms, if such item or equipment has not exhausted at least seventy-five\n(75) percent of its useful life at the time of the installation; (iii)\n\nWhere it is determined that an item is\neligible to be replaced even though it has not exhausted seventy-five (75)\npercent of its useful life and that it was installed as part of a substantial\nrehabilitation or the new construction of a building for which the owner set\ninitial building-wide rents, the DHCR may reduce the increase granted for a\nmajor capital improvement by a proportion of the remaining useful life of such\nitem or equipment. (iv)\n\nWhere it is\ndetermined that an item is eligible to be replaced even though it has not\nexhausted one-hundred (100) percent of its useful life, but has exhausted more\nthan seventy-five (75) percent of its useful life, the DHCR may reduce the\nincrease granted for a major capital improvement by a proportion of the\nremaining useful life of such item or equipment. (f) In no event shall a temporary major\ncapital improvement increase be granted for work done in individual apartments\nthat is otherwise not an improvement to an entire building. (ii)\n\nThere has been other necessary work\nperformed in connection with, and directly related to a major capital\nimprovement, which may be included in the computation of an increase in the\nmaximum rent only if such other necessary work was completed within a\nreasonable time after the completion of the major capital improvement to which\nit relates. Such other necessary work must: (a) improve, restore or preserve the quality\nof the structure and the grounds; (b) have been completed subsequent to, or\ncontemporaneously with, the completion of the work for the major capital\nimprovement; and\n(c) not be for\nprimarily cosmetic improvements or for operational costs. (iii)\n\nWith approval by the DHCR, there has\nbeen an increase in services or improvement, other than repairs, on a\nbuilding-wide basis, which the owner can demonstrate are necessary in order to\ncomply with a specific requirement of law. (iv)\n\nWith approval by the DHCR, there have\nbeen other improvements made or services provided to the building or building\ncomplex, other than those specified in subparagraphs (i)-(iii) of this\nparagraph, with the express consent of the tenants in occupancy of at least\nseventy-five (75) percent of the rent regulated housing\naccommodations. (2)\n\nMajor\n\nCapital Improvement Schedules\n(i) The\nreasonable costs that may be recovered for qualified major capital improvements\nmay not exceed the recoverable costs, as determined by DHCR. In making such\ndetermination, DHCR shall, unless for good cause shown or otherwise specified, refer to such reasonable costs as specified in the Reasonable Cost Schedule\nfound in the Reasonable Cost Schedule that is in effect at the time that the\ncontract for work for the major capital improvement was executed. (ii)\n\nThe Reasonable Cost Schedule shall\nprovide the recoverable cost of major capital improvements that fall within the\nfollowing main three categories: 1. Major\n\nSystems; i. The maximum recoverable costs\nshall be presented for the following classes of work: (a) Plumbing; (b) Gas Repipe; (c) Wiring; (d) Windows; (e) Boiler/Burner; (f) Hot Water Heater; (g) Elevator Replacement; and\n(h) Elevator Modernization. 2. Façade, Parapet, Roof; i. The maximum recoverable\ncosts shall be presented for the following classes of work: (a) Façade; (b) Parapet; and\n(c) Roof. 3. Other Systems. i. The maximum recoverable costs shall be\npresented for the following classes of work: (a) Chimney; (b) Doors; (c) Security System; and\n(d) Intercom; and may include such other\nsystems as DHCR may determine. (iii)\n\nEach class of major capital improvement\nmay list more detailed types of capital improvement work. Each class of major\ncapital improvement described in the Schedule may be inclusive of additional\ncosts that can be associated with the type of improvements listed within such\nclass. (iv)\n\nThe costs of each type\nof major capital improvement work will be listed as per unit, per unit of\nmeasurement or per piece of equipment, as is appropriate given the nature of\nthe improvement. (v) The maximum\nrecoverable costs for each type of major capital improvement specified in the\ninitial Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be based on a survey of such\nconstruction costs undertaken for such installation. (a) The maximum recoverable costs listed in\nthe Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be initially published and made available\nfor public review and comment in conjunction with the promulgation process\nrequired for adoption of this regulation. (vi)\n\nPeriodic Review of Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule: Every year after adoption of this regulation, DHCR shall assess and\nreview the categories of major capital improvements, the classes of work within\ncategories eligible for major capital improvements and the maximum recoverable\ncosts listed for the types of major capital improvement costs identified in the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule. (vii)\n\nProcedure: (a) When applying for a temporary\nmajor capital improvement rent increase, owners are required to submit an\nitemized list of work performed with a description or explanation of the reason\nor purpose of such work. (1)\n\nCosts may be\ngranted for related expenses that are not specified in the actual schedule, if\nthey are found to be: (i) within or below the\nmaximum costs for the class of work, (ii)\nare necessary for the claimed\nimprovement, and\n(iii)\neligible for\nreimbursement as a major capital improvement. (2)\n\nCosts will not be granted for expenses\nwhich are ineligible for major capital improvement rent increases. (3)\n\nOnly the actual and verifiable amounts\nexpended by owners for qualifying major capital improvement costs will be the\nbasis for any temporary major capital improvement rent increase. Qualifying\nowners will, therefore, be awarded a temporary major capital improvement rent\nincrease on the lesser of either: (i) the\nactual amount expended, or\n(ii)\nthe\nmaximum reasonable cost from the schedule, and such other additional items that\nare eligible as a major capital improvement but are not listed as part of the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule. (b) The schedule provides a maximum of costs\nthat can be granted for eligible major capital improvements. All costs granted\nfor a temporary major capital improvement rent increase must be actual, reasonable, verifiable, and meet all other regulatory\nrequirements. (viii)\n\nWaiver of Application of Reasonable Cost Schedule\n(a) Owners may apply for a waiver of\napplication of the Reasonable Cost Schedule. The waiver request will be denied, unless the owner satisfies the waiver requirements provided herein, and the\n\nDivision finds the waiver of the application of the schedule to be reasonable\nand warranted under the circumstances set forth in such application. (b) If an owner's application for a waiver of\nthe reasonable cost schedule is denied, the owner's maximum recoupment shall be\nlimited to that required by the applicable Reasonable Cost Schedule. (c) Notwithstanding any waiver of the\nreasonable cost schedule, not all costs claimed for a temporary major capital\nimprovement rent increase may be awarded, as the costs of items claimed may be\ndisallowed, in whole or in part, pursuant to all other requirements set forth\nin this section that must be met and fully supported. (d) Pursuant to the requirements specified\nbelow, such application must be fully supported and demonstrate that the\nclaimed costs underlying the temporary MCI rent increase are: (1)\nnot identified in the Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule, or\n(2)\nnecessarily and\nappropriately priced higher than those costs listed in the Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule due to the unique nature of the installation and the circumstances\nsurrounding such installation, and such costs are accurate, reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible for a rent increase under these\ncircumstances, or\n(3)\nthat use of\nthe Reasonable Cost Schedule will cause an undue hardship and the use of\nalternative procedures are appropriate to the interests of the owner, the\ntenants, and the public, and the costs of such improvement are accurate, reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible for a rent increase under the\ncircumstances. (e) Owners\nmust request a waiver of the use of the Reasonable Cost Schedule in writing and\naccompany the application with the information and documentation as specified\nin subparagraph (x). (ix)\n\nRequirements for Waiver under Specific Circumstances\n(a) At the time of the initial application\nfor a temporary major capital improvement rent increase, an owner must apply\nfor a waiver of application of the Reasonable Cost Schedule. Such application\nshall include all necessary requirements set forth in subparagraph (viii) of\nthis paragraph and must also meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nNon-Landmarked Buildings (Buildings not\ndesignated by the Landmark Commission): (i) A\nlicensed engineer or architect must certify that: (A)\nthe major capital improvement costs for\nwhich an owner seeks a temporary major capital improvement rent increase are\naccurate and reasonable under the circumstances; and\n(B)\nthere is no common ownership or other\nfinancial interest between the contractor installing the replacement or upgrade\nand the ownership entity of the owner; and\n(C)\na bid process was conducted and\nsupervised by a licensed architect or engineer. (2)\n\nLandmarked Buildings (Buildings\ndesignated by the Landmark Commission): The costs beyond those permitted by the\nreasonable cost schedule that were the result of any law, regulation, rule, or\nrequirement under which the premises have been designated a landmark\nbuilding. (3)\n\nCapital Improvement\n\nWork Performed While Also Under Another Governmental Agency's Supervision: DHCR\nmay also accept the cost of contract where: (i) the building is subject to both (a) the\n\nRent Stabilization Law, and (b) another housing program, and\n(ii)\nthe contract is approved by or awarded\nunder the supervision of a state, city or local housing entity in conjunction\nwith that affordable housing program, and\n(iii)\nsuch supervision includes a process by\nwhich such supervising agency reviews the costs to assure they are\nreasonable. (4)\n\nEmergency\n\nCapital Improvements: DHCR may also accept the cost of contract where capital\nimprovements were performed to remedy an emergency condition and for which the\nowner paid more than the reasonable costs due to such emergency. The costs must\nbe actual, reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible for a rent increase\nunder the circumstances. (5)\n\nInterim Rules: (i) An owner may apply for a\nwaiver of application of the Reasonable Cost Schedule if, prior to the\neffective date of this subparagraph (ix), it has either: (A)\nentered a contract for the performance of\nmajor capital improvement work within two years immediately preceding January\n27, 2021, the final adoption date of Emergency Regulation HCR-26-20-00012, or\n(B)\nsubmitted to DHCR an\napplication for a temporary major capital improvement rent\nincrease. (ii)\n\nThe\nrecoverable costs will be determined according to the applicable Reasonable\n\nCost Schedule and these provisions, but the owner need not submit evidence of\ncompliance with the bidding requirements set forth in clause (b) of\nsubparagraph (x) of this paragraph; owner may instead submit for review\nalternative means of establishing the reasonableness of the major capital\nimprovement costs sought to be recovered. (iii)\n\nFor pending major capital improvement\napplications, an owner was required to make this waiver application within 60\ndays of June 16, 2020, unless in the context of processing the major capital\nimprovement application the owner was directed by DHCR to submit an application\nfor waiver. (x) Waiver Procedure: As part of the written\n\nWaiver application for non-emergency capital improvements, owners must submit\nthe following: (a) A certification by a\nlicensed architect or engineer stating that: (1)\n\nThe purchases and contracts, whose costs\nowner seeks to recover have been awarded on the basis of analysis and bidding\nto the fullest extent possible, but with no less than three bidders having been\nsolicited to perform the work unless the owner can demonstrate that the work is\nso highly specialized that such bids cannot be extended; (2)\n\nList of items for which owner solicited\nbids were necessary; (3)\n\nThe costs\nclaimed by owner for the major capital improvement work are accurate and\nreasonable, provided that the architect or engineer's basis for such conclusion\nis fully and credibly supported; (4)\n\nAll changes to the original agreed upon\nscope of work were necessary to the underlying major capital improvement and\nreasonably priced; (5)\n\nThe owner\nselected the lowest responsible bidder or the bidder best suited to perform the\nmajor capital improvement work, provided that the architect or engineer's basis\nfor such conclusion is credibly supported; and\n(6)\n\nSuch other and additional proof as DHCR\nmay require to ascertain the need for the waiver and the certification of such\nreasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible costs. (b) Certification by owner that it has\ncomplied with bid process requirements including submission of: (1)\n\nTabulation of all bids received; and\n(2)\n\nCopies of all bids\nreceived; and\n(3)\nA certification\nby each bidder disclosing whether the owner or any board member, general\npartner, officer or employee of owner, and/or principal or employee of any\nmanaging agent retained by owner, has a direct or indirect interest in the\nbidder or in the compensation to be received by the bidder pursuant to the\nproposed contract. Failure to accurately and fully complete this certification\nmay result in the rejection of the bid for purposes of determining owner's\napplication for waiver of the use of the Reasonable Cost Schedule, as well as\nrejection and a dismissal of the major capital improvement application; and\n(4)\n\nDetailed description of the\nitems for which owner initially solicited bids. (c) A certification by the owner's architect\nor engineer certifying the necessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of\nthe costs of all changes to the original agreed upon scope of work that were\nperformed in connection with the major capital improvement, along with a\ndescription of the changes in the scope, price, or time of completion of the\nwork related to each change order. (xi)\n\nFor Emergency Capital Improvement MCI\nApplications: The owner must submit a statement from an independent engineer or\narchitect describing the emergency, why the costs were greater than those in\nthe schedule, that the costs were reasonable for the situation, and why the\nowner could not obtain three bids in a timely manner due to the exigent\ncircumstances. (xii)\n\nNotice: As\npart of the MCI application process, any request by an owner for a waiver of\napplication of the Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be made available to the\ntenants of the subject building(s) with an opportunity to comment on and\ncontest the waiver. (xiii)\n\nOperational Bulletin\n\nThe initial Operational Bulletin 2020-1 including all\namendments, shall be issued pursuant to this paragraph. The Operational\n\nBulletin 2020-1 and all amended versions shall be available in hardcopy form at\n92-31 Union Hall Street, Jamaica, Queens, New York, and will be available on\nDHCR's website at\nwww.hcr.ny.gov. (3)\n\nImprovements or\ninstallations for which the DHCR may grant applications for temporary rent\nincreases based upon major capital improvements pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision are described on the following Schedule. Other improvements or\ninstallations that are not included may also qualify, where all requirements of\nsection\n2102.3\n(d) of this\n\nTitle have been met. SCHEDULE OF MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS\n1.

(4)\n\nAny\ntemporary increase pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be 1/144\nof the total cost for a building with thirty-five or fewer housing\naccommodations, or 1/150 of the total cost for a building with more than\nthirty-five housing accommodations, for any determination issued by DHCR after\n\nJune 14, 2019, and such temporary increase shall be removed from the legal\nregulated rent thirty (30) years from the date the increase became effective\ninclusive of any increases granted by the applicable rent guidelines board. For\nincreases pursuant to subparagraphs (1) (iii) and (iv) of this subdivision, in\nthe discretion of the DHCR, an appropriate charge may be imposed in lieu of an\namortization charge when an amortization charge is insignificant or\ninappropriate. (5)\n(i) A temporary major capital improvement\nincrease is fixed to the unit and such increase shall be collectible\nprospectively on the first day of the first month beginning sixty (60) days\nfrom the date of mailing notice of approval to the tenant. Such notice shall\ndisclose the total monthly increase in rent and the first month in which the\ntenant would be required to pay the temporary increase. An approval for a\ntemporary major capital improvement increase shall not include retroactive\npayments. (ii)\n\nThe temporary major\ncapital improvement increase is added to the maximum rent as a temporary\nincrease and will be removed from the maximum rent thirty (30) years from the\ndate the increase became effective inclusive of any increases granted by the\nlocal rent guidelines board. The DHCR shall issue a notice to the owner and all\nthe tenants sixty (60) days prior to the end of the temporary major capital\nimprovement increase and shall include the initial approved increase and the\ntotal amount to be removed from the maximum rent inclusive of any increases\ngranted by the applicable rent guidelines board as referenced in section\n2102.1\nof this Title. (iii)\n\nSuch temporary increases shall not be\ncollectible during the term of a lease then in effect, unless a specific\nprovision in the tenant's lease authorizes an increase during its term pursuant\nto an order issued by the DHCR. (iv)\n\nThe collection of such temporary\nincreases shall not exceed two percent in any year from the effective date of\nthe order granting the increase over the rent set forth in the schedule of\ngross rents, with collectability of any dollar excess above said sum to be\nspread forward in similar increments and added to the rent as established or\nset in future years. In no event shall more than one two-percent increase in\nthe legal regulated rent pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision be\ncollected in the same year, provided, however, that upon a vacancy, the owner\nmay temporarily increase the rent to the full temporary major capital\nimprovement increase amount. (v) In\naddition, for any rent increases due to any major capital improvements approved\non or after June 16, 2012 and before June 16, 2019, an owner may not collect\nmore than two percent in any year for any tenant in occupancy on the date the\nmajor capital improvement was approved, provided the tenant has entered into a\nrenewal lease commencing on or after June 14, 2019, or is or was entitled to\nreceive a renewal lease on or after such date. In such event, the adjusted\nlimit on collectability shall take effect on the first anniversary of the date\non which the increase became collectible to occur after such lease\nrenewal. (vi)\n\nAn increase pursuant\nto paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not be collectible from a tenant to\nwhom there has been issued a currently valid senior citizen or disability rent\nincrease exemption pursuant to local law or ordinance to the extent that such\nincrease may cause the maximum rent of the housing accommodation to exceed a\nspecified portion, if any, pursuant to such local law or ordinance, of the\naggregate disposable income of all members of the household residing in the\nhousing accommodation. (6)\n\nThe determination of the appropriate\nadjustment of a maximum rent shall take into consideration all factors bearing\non the equities involved, subject to the general limitation that the adjustment\ncan be put into effect without dislocation and hardship inconsistent with the\npurposes of the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law, and including as a factor a\nreturn of the actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost to the owner, limited to\nthe reasonable cost schedule in paragraph (2) of this subdivision and exclusive\nof interest or other carrying charges, and the increase in the rental value of\nthe housing accommodations. (7)\nDHCR may issue, upon an owner application, an advisory prior opinion pursuant\nto section\n2109.8\nof this Title, as to whether\nthe proposed work qualifies for an increase in the maximum rent. (8)\n\nNo increase pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision shall be granted by the DHCR, unless an application is filed\nno later than two years after the completion of the installation or improvement\nunless the applicant can demonstrate that the application could not be made\nwithin two years due to delay, beyond the applicant's control, in obtaining\nrequired governmental approvals for which the applicant has applied within such\ntwo-year period. (9)\n\nAn increase\nfor an improvement made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not\nbe granted by the DHCR to the extent that, after a plan for the conversion of a\nbuilding to cooperative or condominium ownership is declared effective, such\nimprovement is paid for out of the cash reserve fund of the cooperative\ncorporation or condominium association. However, where prior to the issuance of\nan order granting the increase, the funds taken from the reserve fund are\nreturned to it by the sponsor or holder of unsold shares or units or through a\nspecial assessment of all shareholders or unit owners, the increase may be\nbased upon the actual, reasonable and verifiable cost of the improvement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent an owner from applying for, and the\nDHCR from granting, an increase for such improvement to the extent that the\ncost thereof is otherwise paid for by an owner. (10)\n\nAny temporary major capital improvement\nincrease granted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be reduced\nby an amount equal to\n(i) any governmental\ngrant received by the landlord, where such grant compensates the landlord for\nany improvements required by a city, state or federal government, an agency or\nany granting governmental entity to be expended for improvements and\n(ii)\nany insurance payment received by the\nlandlord where such insurance payment compensates the landlord for any part of\nthe costs of the improvements. Low interest loans or repayable subsidies shall\nnot be considered grants for the purposes of this\nparagraph. (11)\n\nRent\nadjustments pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be allocated as\nfollows: The DHCR shall determine the dollar amount of the monthly rent\nadjustment. Such dollar amount shall be divided by the total number of rooms in\nthe building. The amount so derived shall then be added to the rent chargeable\nto each housing accommodation in accordance with the number of rooms contained\nin such housing accommodation. (12)\n\nWhen determining the adjustment of maximum rents pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, where the subject building contains commercial rental space\nin addition to residential rental space, and the DHCR determines that such\ncommercial space benefits from the improvement, DHCR shall allocate the\napproved costs between the commercial rental space and the residential rental\nspace based upon the relative square feet of each rental area. (13)\n\nThe DHCR shall not grant an owner's\napplication for a rental adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, in whole or in part, if after review by DHCR, it is determined\nthat the owner is not maintaining all required building wide services, or that\nthere are outstanding hazardous, immediately hazardous, or other similar\nviolations of any municipal, county, State or Federal law. Certain tenant\ncaused violations may be excepted. A tenant's repeated failure to provide\naccess to remediate a violation may result in the violation being considered to\nbe tenant caused. (i) An owner application, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, may be rejected if it is\ndetermined that there are one or more unresolved applicable violations. A\nrejected application may be refiled within sixty (60) days which shall stay the\ntwo-year filing requirement provided in paragraph (8) of this subdivision and\npreserve the original filing date. In the absence of good cause shown, a\nrejected application that is refiled outside of the sixty (60) day period will\nnot retain the original filing date. (ii)\nA timely refiled application pursuant to\nsubparagraph 13(i) of this subdivision, that has not addressed the outstanding\nviolations placed against the building or has had new violations placed against\nthe building in the interim period since rejection, will again be denied\nwithout leave to refile within sixty (60) days. (iii)\n\nPrior to the issuance of a\ndetermination, the DHCR shall review and determine if one or more violations\nhave been issued and not corrected to the subject building during the\nprocessing of an owner application pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. The owner will be allowed sixty (60) days to correct such\nviolation(s). In the absence of good cause shown, failure to correct the\nviolation(s) within the allotted time shall result in a denial of the\napplication. (iv)\nDHCR shall retain\nthe ability and right where appropriate to review all penalties and violations\nat any other time during the pendency of such application. (14)\n\nWhere an application for a temporary\nmajor capital improvement rent increase has been filed, a tenant shall have\nsixty (60) days from the date of mailing of a notice of a proceeding in which\nto answer or reply. The DHCR shall provide any responding tenant with the\nreasons for the DHCR's approval or denial of such application. (15)\n\nWhere during the processing of a rent\nincrease application filed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, tenants interpose answers complaining of defective operation of the major\ncapital improvement, the complaint may be resolved in the following manner: (i) Where municipal sign-offs (other than\nbuilding permits) are required for the approval of the installation, and the\ntenants' complaints relate to the subject matter of the sign-off, the\ncomplaints may be resolved on the basis of the sign-off, and the tenants\nreferred to the approving governmental agency for whatever action such agency\nmay deem appropriate. (ii)\n\nWhere\nmunicipal sign-offs are not required, or where the alleged defective operation\nof the major capital improvement does not relate to the subject matter of the\nsign-off, the complaint may be resolved by the affidavit of an independent\nlicensed architect or engineer that the condition complained of was\ninvestigated and found not to have existed, or if found to have existed, was\ncorrected. Such affidavit, which shall be served by the DHCR on the tenants, will raise a rebuttable presumption that the major capital improvement is\nproperly operative. Tenants may only rebut this presumption based on persuasive\nevidence, for example, a counter affidavit by an independent licensed architect\nor engineer, or an affirmation by 51 percent of the complaining tenants. (a) General requirements. There must be no\ncommon ownership, or other financial interest, between such architect or\nengineer and the owner or tenants. The affidavit shall state that there is no\nsuch relationship or other financial interest. The affidavit must also contain\na statement that the architect or engineer did not engage in the performance of\nany work, other than the investigation, relating to the conditions that are the\nsubject of the affidavit. The affidavit submitted must contain the signature\nand professional stamp of the architect or engineer. DHCR may conduct follow-up\ninspections randomly to ensure that the affidavits accurately indicate the\ncondition of the premises. Any person or party who submits a false statement\nshall be subject to all penalties provided by law. (iii)\n\nAt the discretion of the DHCR, the DHCR\nmay inspect the major capital improvement to determine whether the installation\nwas conducted in a workmanlike manner or the work was sufficiently\ncomprehensive so as to benefit all tenants. (16)\n\nThe DHCR shall annually inspect and\naudit no less than twenty-five percent of applications for a temporary major\ncapital improvement increase that have been submitted and approved. Such\nprocess shall include individual inspections and document review to ensure that\nowners complied with all obligations and responsibilities under the law for\ntemporary major capital improvement increases. Inspections shall include\nin-person confirmation that such improvements have been completed in such way\nas described in the application. (e) Increased subtenants or occupants. (1)\n\nThere has been since March 1, 1950 a\nsubletting without the written consent of the landlord or an increase in the\nnumber of adult occupants who are not members of the immediate family of the\ntenant, and the landlord has not been compensated therefor by adjustment of the\nmaximum rent by lease or order of the Administrator or pursuant to the federal\n\nAct. (2)\n\nThe Administrator may\ngrant an appropriate adjustment by reason of such change. Such adjustment shall\nbe effective only during the period of subletting or increase in the number of\noccupants. (f) Unique or\npeculiar circumstances\n(1)\n\nBecause of unique\nor peculiar circumstances which materially affected the maximum rent thereof, the maximum rent is substantially lower than the rents generally prevailing in\nthe same area for substantially similar housing accommodations. (2)\n\nThe Administrator may grant an\nappropriate adjustment of the maximum rent in the amount requested provided\nthat the adjustment shall not result in a maximum rent higher than the rents\ngenerally prevailing in the same area for substantially similar housing\naccommodations. (g) Net\nannual return\n(1)\n\nThe net annual rental\nincome from a property yields a net annual return of less than seven and\none-half percent of the valuation of the property, as hereinafter defined. Such\nvaluation shall be the current assessed valuation established by a city, town\nor village, which is in effect at the time of the filing of the application for\nan adjustment under this paragraph, properly adjusted by applying thereto the\nratio which such assessed valuation bears to the full valuation as determined\nby the State Board of Equalization and Assessment on the basis of the\nassessment rolls of cities, towns and villages for the year 1954 and certified\nfor such year by such board pursuant to section 49-d of the Tax Law; provided, however, that where at the time of the filing of the application for an\nadjustment under this paragraph such board has computations for such year\nindicating a different ratio for subclasses of residential property in a city, town or village, the Administrator shall give due consideration to such\ndifferent ratio except ratios in excess of 100 percent, provided, however, that\nwhere such board has not determined and certified any ratio pursuant to such\nsection of such law for a city, town or village for such year, the\n\nAdministrator shall apply the ratio determined or certified by such board\npursuant to section\n1212\nof\nthe Real Property Tax Law for the most recent year except where there has been\na bona fide sale of the property within the period between March 15, 1957, and\nthe time of filing of the application, as a result of a transaction at arms'\nlength, on normal financing terms at a readily ascertainable price and\nunaffected by special circumstances such as a forced sale, exchange of\nproperty, package deal, wash sale or sale to a co-operative; provided, however, that where there has been more than one such bona fide sale within a period of\ntwo years prior to the date of filing of such application the Administrator\nshall disregard the most recent of such sales if a prior sale within such\ntwo-year period was adopted as the valuation of the property in a proceeding\nunder this paragraph. In determining whether a sale was on normal financing\nterms, the Administrator shall give due consideration to the following factors: (i) the ratio of the cash payment received by\nthe seller to the sales price of the property and the annual gross income from\nthe property; (ii)\nthe total amount\nof the outstanding mortgages which are liens against the property (including\npurchase money mortgages) as compared with the equalized assessed valuation of\nthe property; (iii)\nthe ratio of\nthe sales price to the annual gross income of the property, with consideration\ngiven to the total amount of rent adjustments previously granted, exclusive of\nrent adjustments because of changes in dwelling space, services, furniture, furnishings or equipment, major capital improvements, or substantial\nrehabilitation; (iv)\nthe presence\nof deferred amortization in purchase money mortgages, or the assignment of such\nmortgages at a discount; and\n(v) any other facts and circumstances surrounding such sale which, in the judgment\nof the Administrator, may have a bearing upon the question of financing. No\napplication for adjustment of maximum rent based upon a sales price valuation\nshall be filed by the landlord under this subdivision prior to six months from\nthe date of such sale of the property. In addition, no adjustment ordered by\nthe Administrator based upon such sales price valuation shall be effective\nprior to one year from the date of such sale. Where, however, the assessed\nvaluation of the land exceeds four times the assessed valuation of the\nbuildings thereon the Administrator may determine a valuation of the property\nequal to five times the equalized assessed valuation of the buildings, for the\npurpose of this paragraph. The Administrator may make a determination that the\nvaluation of the property for the purposes of this subdivision is an amount\ndifferent from such equalized assessed valuation where there is a request for a\nreduction in such assessed valuation currently pending; or where there has been\na reduction in the assessed valuation for the year next preceding the effective\ndate of the current assessed valuation in effect at the time of the filing of\nthe application. (2)\n\nFor\nthe purposes of this subdivision the following terms shall mean and include: (i) Property. Any structure or group of\nstructures including the land containing housing accommodations having either\ncommon facilities, or which are contiguous, or which are operated as a single\nenterprise and which the Administrator shall in his discretion find appropriate\nto be considered as a single operation for the purpose of this subdivision. The\nterm property also includes a housing accommodation allocated to a proprietary\nlessee in a structure or premises owned by a co-operative corporation or\nassociation. (ii)\n\nNet annual\nreturn. The amount by which the earned income exceeds the operating expenses of\nthe property. (iii)\n\nEarned income. The current maximum rents on an annual basis from all controlled housing\naccommodations; the current rents on an annual basis from all decontrolled and\nuncontrolled housing accommodations, commercial and business space, and other\nrented or rentable space; any other income earned from the operation of the\nproperty. Where a housing accommodation without a maximum rent is vacant or is\noccupied without payment of any rent or with payment of a partial rent, the\nrent generally prevailing for substantially similar controlled housing\naccommodations shall be deemed the rent for the purposes of the application. Where commercial or business or other rentable space is vacant or is occupied\nwithout paying of any rent or with payment of a partial rent, the rent\ngenerally prevailing for substantially similar space shall be deemed the rent\nfor the purposes of the application. Where the Administrator finds in\nconsidering an application under this paragraph that a present tenant is paying\na rent less than the maximum rent, the Administrator, upon request of the\nlandlord, may reduce the maximum rent of the housing accommodation to the\namount actually being paid, or to the highest maximum rent for comparable\ncontrolled housing accommodations in the structure, whichever is\nhigher. (iv)\n\nOperating expenses. All operating expenses necessary in the operation and maintenance of the\nproperty and properly allocable to the test year, excluding mortgage interest\nand amortization, but including an allowance for depreciation of two per cent\nof the valuation of the buildings exclusive of the land, as defined in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, or the amount shown for depreciation of the\nbuildings in the latest required federal income tax return, whichever is lower; provided, however, that no allowance for depreciation of the buildings shall be\nincluded where the buildings have been fully depreciated for federal income tax\npurposes or on the books of the owner. Increases or decreases in real estate\ntaxes, water or sewage charges and wages currently in effect may be projected\nin computing operating expenses. (v) Test year. The most recent full calendar\nyear or fiscal year, or any 12 consecutive months ending not more than 90 days\nprior to the filing of the application. (3)\n\nIf, as determined by the Administrator, a\nproperty is earning a net annual return of less than six percent of the\nvaluation of the property, the Administrator shall grant an adjustment in the\nmaximum rents. (4)\n\nNo adjustment\nunder this subdivision for any individual housing accommodation shall exceed 15\npercent of the maximum rent in effect on the date the order is issued under\nthis subdivision; provided, however, that the Administrator may waive this\nlimitation where a greater increase is necessary to make the earned income of\nthe property equal to its operating expenses; provided further, however, that\nthe maximum rents, subject to the allocation requirement of paragraph (5) of\nsubdivision (a) of this section, shall be increased by such further additional\namount during each succeeding 12-month period, not exceeding 15 percent of the\nmaximum rent in effect on the effective date of the original order of\nadjustment, until the maximum rents for the property shall reflect the net\nannual return provided for in this subdivision, but, in no event, however, shall the total increase ordered for a succeeding 12-month period be more than\nan additional three percent of the maximum rent in effect on the effective date\nof the original order of adjustment unless a new application is filed by the\nlandlord. (5)\nno further\napplication may be filed under this subdivision sooner than one year from the\ndate of filing a prior application under this subdivision if an increase had\npreviously been granted thereunder to establish a net annual return of six\npercent of the valuation of the property. No order increasing a maximum rent\nshall be issued on a subsequent application sooner than one year from the\neffective date, or the earlier effective date if there are dual effective\ndates, of the order granting an increase on the prior application. The\n\nAdministrator may waive these limitations where the property has been affected\nby a significant increase in operating costs which applied to a substantial\nsegment of housing accommodations in the community. (h) Unavoidable increases in operating costs\nin small structures\n(1)\n\nThe landlord owns no\nmore than four rental units within the State and has incurred unavoidable\nincreases in property taxes, fuel, utilities, insurance and repairs and\nmaintenance which have occurred since the federal date determining the maximum\nrent or the date the property was acquired by the present owner, whichever is\nlater. (2)\n\nWhere the Administrator\nfinds in considering an application under this subdivision that a present\ntenant is paying a rent less than the maximum rent, the Administrator, upon\nrequest of the landlord, may reduce the maximum rent of the housing\naccommodation to the amount actually being paid, or to the highest maximum rent\nfor comparable controlled housing accommodations in the structure, whichever is\nhigher. If, as determined by the Administrator, the landlord has not been fully\ncompensated by increases in rental income sufficient to offset such increases\nin operating costs the Administrator shall grant an adjustment in the maximum\nrents. (3)\n\nNo further application\nmay be filed under this subdivision sooner than one year from the date of\nfiling a prior application under this paragraph if an increase had previously\nbeen granted thereunder. No order increasing a maximum rent shall be issued on\na subsequent application sooner than one year from the effective date, or the\nearlier effective date if there are dual effective dates, of the order granting\nan increase on the prior application. The Administrator may waive these\nlimitations where the property has been affected by a significant increase in\noperating costs which applied to a substantial segment of housing\naccommodations in the community. (i) Unavoidable increases in operating costs\nin other specified structures\n(1)\n\nThe\nlandlord operates a hotel or rooming house or owns a cooperative apartment and\nhas incurred unavoidable increases in property taxes and other costs, including\ncosts of operation of such hotel or rooming house, but excluding mortgage\ninterest and amortization, and excluding allowances for depreciation\nobsolescence and reserves, which have occurred since the federal date\ndetermining the maximum rent or the date the landlord commenced the operation\nof the property, whichever is later. (2)\n\nWhere the Administrator finds in\nconsidering an application under this subdivision that a present tenant is\npaying a rent less than the maximum rent, the Administrator, upon request of\nthe landlord, may reduce the maximum rent of the housing accommodation to the\namount actually being paid, or to the highest maximum rent for comparable\ncontrolled housing accommodations in the structure, whichever is higher. If, as\ndetermined by the administrator, the landlord has not been fully compensated by\nincreases in rental income from the controlled housing accommodations\nsufficient to offset such increases in operating costs as are allocable to such\ncontrolled housing accommodations the administrator shall grant an adjustment\nin the maximum rents. (3)\n\nNo\nfurther application may be filed under this subdivision sooner than one year\nfrom the date of filing a prior application under this paragraph if an increase\nhad previously been granted thereunder. No order increasing a maximum rent\nshall be issued on a subsequent application sooner than one year from the\neffective date, or the earlier effective date if there are dual effective\ndates, of the order granting an increase on the prior application. The\nadministrator may waive these limitations where the property has been affected\nby a significant increase in operating costs which applied to a substantial\nsegment of housing accommodations in the community. (j) Other necessary adjustments of maximum\nrents not inconsistent with the purposes of the act or regulations Where the\nadministrator finds in considering an application of the landlord, that\nadjustments of maximum rents on grounds other than those set forth in\nsubdivisions (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) or (i) of this section are not\ninconsistent with the purposes of the act or these regulations, and such\nadjustments are necessary to maintain a system of rent controls at levels which\nare generally fair and equitable, the administrator may issue orders increasing\nthe maximum rents by the amounts of such adjustments. The total adjustments of\nmaximum rents for any housing accommodation in any 12-month period under this\nparagraph shall not exceed 15 percent of the maximum rent in effect on the date\nof the first order granting an adjustment in said 12-month period. The\nadministrator may waive this limitation because of unique and peculiar\ncircumstances, where he finds such waiver is not inconsistent with the purposes\nof the act or this Part. (k) Validation of increases legally authorized pursuant to the Emergency Tenant\n\nProtection Act in the City of Mount Vernon prior to the effectuation of the\nreimposition of regulation pursuant to the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law. A landlord who was authorized to collect a rental adjustment by lease offered\nprior to July 15, 1983 pursuant to the Emergency Tenant Protection Act in\naccordance with the rent guidelines authorized by the Westchester County Rent\n\nGuidelines Board for guideline year 1982-1983, may continue to collect such\nrental increases provided that the landlord was not at the same time collecting\nan increase pursuant to subdivision (j) of this section, and provided further\nthat he makes a valid and authorized application in accordance with subdivision\n(j) of this section as implemented by operational bulletin 110 on or before\n\nSeptember 1, 1983. The rental adjustment received pursuant to subdivision (j)\nof this section will be inclusive of those increases received pursuant to this\nsection and shall not be in addition thereto. Notes\nN.Y.
