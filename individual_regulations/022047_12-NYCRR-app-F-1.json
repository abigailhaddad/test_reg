Some combustible fabrics, when\nused for clothing, are potentially dangerous to the wearer because of the speed\nand intensity of flame with which those fabrics burn and their ease of\nignition, and because of the design of the garment. Two of these factors, the\nease of ignition and the speed of flame spread, can be measured with the\ninstrument described herein. It is suggested that measurement of these two factors, together\nwith visual observation of flame intensity, will permit the separation of\nvarious fabrics into three classes of flammability, thus assisting in a\njudgment of fabric suitability for clothing. 1. PURPOSE\n1.1 The purpose of this standard is to reduce danger of injury\nand loss of life by providing, on a national basis, standard methods of testing\nand rating the flammability of textiles and textile products for clothing use, thereby discouraging the use of any dangerously flammable clothing\ntextiles. 2. SCOPE\n2.1 The standard provides methods of testing the flammability\nof clothing and textiles intended to be used for clothing, [FN1] establishes\nthree classes of flammability, sets forth the requirements which textiles shall\nmeet to be so classified, and warns against the use of those textiles which\nhave burning characteristics unsuitable for clothing. 2.2 Specific exceptions. --This standard shall not apply\nto--\n(a) Hats, gloves, and\nfootwear\n(b) Interlining fabrics\n[FN2]\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n3.1 Flammability. 3.1.1. Normal flammability, Class 1. --This class shall include\ntextiles which meet the minimum requirements set forth in 3.1.1.1 or 3.1.1.2. Textiles meeting these requirements are generally accepted by the trade as\nhaving no unusual burning characteristics. 3.1.1.1 Textiles without nap, pile, tufting, flock, or other\ntype of raised-fiber surface. --Such textiles in their original state and/or\nafter being dry-cleaned and washed as described in 4.4 and 4.5, when tested as\ndescribed in section 4, shall be classified as Class 1, normal flammability, when the time of flame spread is 4 seconds or more. 3.1.1.2 Napped, pile, tufted, flocked, or other textiles having\na raised-fiber surface. --Such textiles in their original state and/or after\nbeing dry-cleaned and washed as described in 4.4 and 4.5, when tested as\ndescribed in section 4, shall be classified as Class 1, normal flammability, when the time of flame spread is more than 7 seconds, or when they burn with a\nrapid surface flash (from 0 to 7 seconds), provided the intensity of the flame\nis so low as not to ignite or fuse the base fabric. 3.1.2. Intermediate flammability, Class 2. --This class shall\ninclude textiles which meet the minimum requirements set forth in 3.1.2.1. Textiles meeting these requirements are recognized by the trade as having\nflammability characteristics between normal and rapid and intense\nburning. 3.1.2.1 Napped, pile, tufted, flocked, or other textiles having\na raised-fiber surface. --Such textiles in their original state and/or after\nbeing dry-cleaned and washed as described in 4.4 and 4.5, when tested as\ndescribed in section 4, shall be classified as Class 2, intermediate\nflammability, when the time of flame spread is from 4 to 7 seconds, both\ninclusive, and the base fabric ignites or fuses. 3.1.3. Rapid and intense burning, Class 3. --This class shall\ninclude textiles which have burning characteristics as described in 3.1.3.1 and\n3.1.3.2. Such textiles are considered dangerously flammable and recognized by\nthe trade as being unsuitable for clothing because of their rapid and intense\nburning. 3.1.3.1 Textiles free from nap, pile, tufting, flock, or other\ntype of raised-fiber surface. --Such textiles in their original state and/or\nafter being dry-cleaned and washed as described in 4.4 and 4.5, when tested as\ndescribed in section 4, shall be classified as Class 3, rapid and intense\nburning, when the time of flame spread is less than 4 seconds. 3.1.3.2 Napped, pile, tufted, flocked, or other textiles having\na raised-fiber surface. --Such textiles in their original state and/or after\nbeing dry-cleaned and washed as described in 4.4 and 4.5, when tested as\ndescribed in section 4, shall be classified as Class 3, rapid and intense\nburning, when the time of flame spread is less than 4 seconds and when the\nintensity of flame is such as to ignite or fuse the base fabric. 4. METHODS OF TEST\n4.1 Test specimens. 4.1.1. Number and size of specimens required. --Five specimens, each measuring 2 by 6 inches, are required for each test. 4.1.2. For textiles without a raised-fiber surface the long\ndimension shall be that in which they burn most rapidly, and the more rapidly\nburning surface shall be tested. To establish the long dimension and the\nsurface, preliminary tests are made as described in 4.7, with specimens cut in\ndifferent directions. 4.1.3. For textiles having a raised-fiber surface, the direction\nof the lay of the surface fibers shall be parallel with the long dimension of\nthe specimens. For this type of textiles with varying depths of pile, tufting, etc., the specimens are taken from that part and tested on that surface which\nhas the fastest rate of burning. 4.1.4. If the specimens in the preliminary test, when tested as\ndescribed in 4.7, do not ignite or are very slow burning, or should leave a\nfire-retarding finish, a swatch large enough to provide the specimens required\nfor the test, with allowance for shrinkage in dry cleaning and washing, is\nsubjected to the dry cleaning and washing procedures described in 4.4 and 4.5. The specimens for the flammability test are then taken from it. 4.1.5. The specimens required for testing, each 2 by 6 inches, are marked out on the back (or under side) of each sample with the long\ndimension in the direction in which burning is most rapid, as established in\nthe preliminary trials. The end of the specimen toward which and on the face of\nwhich burning is most rapid is identified by attaching a staple to it. The\nspecimens are then cut out. Image\n4.2 Flammability tester.[FN3]--The flammability tester consists\nof a draft-proof ventilated chamber enclosing a standardized ignition medium, sample rack, and automatic timing device. 4.2.1. Draft-proof chamber with vented top (A, fig. 2). --This\nmetal chamber prevents air circulation around the specimen rack and flame, but\npermits free ventilation for rapid oxidation. The chamber is 141/2 inches wide, 81/2 inches deep, and 14 inches high. There are 12 half-inch holes equidistant\nalone the rear of the top closure. A ventilating strip is provided at the base\nof the sliding glass door in the front of the apparatus. 4.2.2. Specimen rack (B, fig. 2). --The specimen rack provides\nsupports for the frames in which the specimens are mounted. The angle of\ninclination is 45°. Two guide pins projecting downward from the center of\nthe base of the rack travel in slots provided in the floor of the chamber so\nthat adjustment can be made for the thickness of the specimen in relation to\nthe flame front. A stop is provided in the base of the chamber to assist in\nadjusting the position of the rack. 4.2.3. Specimen holder (C, fig. 2). --The specimen holder\nconsists of two 1/16- inch matched metal plates with clamps mounted along the\nsides, between which the specimen is fixed. The plates are slotted and loosely\npinned for alinement. The two plates of the holder cover all but 11/2 inches of\nthe width of the specimen for its full length. The specimen holder is supported\nin the draft-proof chamber on the rack at an angle of 45°. Five specimen\nholders are provided. 4.2.4. Indicating finger (D, fig. 2). --The forepart of this\nfinger touches the specimen when the rack is adjusted. By means of this finger\nthe thickness of the specimen is compensated for in the throw of the gas\nnozzle. Image\n4.2.5. Control knobs (not shown). --There are two of these knobs\nwhich hold the rack in test position. The knobs can be reached under the stage\nof the cabinet and permit forward and backward movements of the rack when\nloosened. 4.2.6. Ignition medium (F, fig. 2). --The ignition medium\nconsists of a spring-motor-driven gas jet formed around a 26-gage hypodermic\nneedle. A trigger located in the front of the apparatus serves to wind the\nspring-motor when the machine is placed in operation. The gas jet is protected\nby a copper shield. 4.2.7. Stop cord (G, fig. 2). --This cord, stretched from the\nspool (P, fig. 2) through suitable thread guides provided on the specimen frame\nand chamber walls, permits the lacing of the cord in the proper position\nexactly 5 inches from the point where the center of the ignition flame impinges\non the test Specimen. The stop cord consists of a No. 50 mercerized sewing\nthread and measures the rise and spread of the flame from the test\nspecimen. 4.2.8. Pulley or eye (H, fig. 2). --The pulley or eye is the\nsupport and guide for the stop cord. 4.2.9. Stop weight (I, fig. 2). --The weight, attached by means\nof a clip to the stop cord, in dropping actuates the stop motion. 4.2.10. Slide door control (J, fig. 2). --This knob moves the\ncatch mechanism used to hold the sliding door in an open position for insertion\nof test specimen racks. 4.2.11. Slide door (K, fig. 2). --A glass door in its normal\nposition slides in the grooves at the front of the cabinet. 4.2.12. Fuel-control valve (L, fig. 2). --This valve consists of\na sensitive control device for regulating the fuel supply at the tank. The\nvalve ends in a 1/2-inch male connection for attachment to the standard butane\ntank of 2 pounds capacity. 4.2.13. Flow meter (V, fig. 2). --A flow meter is used to bring\nthe fuel supply to test level by means of the control valve. The flow meter\nconsists of a U - shaped glass tube cut into the gas line in a manner to\nregister the gas pressure delivered to the microburner. Attached to the case\nwall behind the flow meter is a movable metal plate with two parallel\nhorizontal lines properly spaced for the desired flame length. When the\npressure is off, the plate is so regulated that the liquid level in both sides\nof the U -shaped tube meets the lower line. When the test is made the pressure\nis so adjusted that the higher liquid level in the U -shaped tube meets the\nupper line. 4.2.14. Butane, c. p., container[FN4](M, fig. 2).--This fuel\nsupply is a No. 4 cylinder of c. p. butane. 4.2.15. Stop watch and timing mechanism (N, fig. 2). --This\nwatch, by means of special attachments, is actuated to a start by connection\nwith the gas jet (F, fig. 2). A driving mechanism on rear of cabinet (S, fig. 2) moves the gas jet to its most-forward position and automatically starts the\ntiming at the moment of flame impact. The falling weight (I, fig. 2), when\ncaused to move by severance of cord (G, fig. 2), stops the watch. Timing is\nread directly. 4.2.16. Starting lever (O, fig. 2).--This lever is operated from\nleft to right in one stroke and is released to operate the gas jet. 4.2.17. Cord supply (P, fig. 2).--This supply, consisting of a\nspool of No. 50 mercerized cotton sewing thread, is fastened to the side of the\nchamber and can be withdrawn by releasing the thumbscrew holding same in\nposition. 4.2.18. Cord loop (Q, fig. 2).--At a point behind the stop cord\n(G, fig. 2) on the rear panel, there is installed another loop to draw the cord\naway from directly over the flame. 4.2.19. Draft ventilator strip (R, fig. 2).--A draft ventilator\nstrip is placed across the front opening, sealing the space between the sliding\ndoor when in lowered position and the base on which the grid rack is\nattached. 4.3 Brushing device.[FN5]\n4.3.1. This device consists of a baseboard over which a smaller, carriage is drawn. This carriage runs on parallel tracks attached to the edges\nof the upper surface of the baseboard. The brush is hinged with pin hinges at\nthe rear edge of the baseboard and rests on the carriage vertically with a\npressure of 150 grams. 4.3.2. The brush consists of two rows of stiff nylon bristles\nmounted with the tufts in a staggered position. The bristles are 0.016 inch in\ndiameter and 0.75 inch in length. There are 20 bristles per tuft and 4 tufts\nper inch. A clamp is attached to the forward edge of the movable carriage to\npermit holding the specimen on the carriage during the brushing\noperation. Image\n4.3.3. After the specimen has been put in place on the carriage\nand fastened by means of the clamp, the brush is raised, the carriage pushed to\nthe rear, and the brush lowered to the face of the specimen. The carriage is\nthen drawn forward by hand at a uniform rate. 4.4 Dry cleaning.--A swatch from each sample, as mentioned in\nparagraph 4.1.4, shall be subjected to the following dry-cleaning\nprocedure. 4.4.1. Apparatus. --The apparatus is a cylinder, preferably of\nmetal, approximately 13 inches high and about 8 3/4 inches in diameter\n(capacity 3 gallons). The cylinder is mounted in a vertical position on an axis\nwhich is inclined 50° to the axis of the cylinder, and is rotated about\nthis axis at a speed of 45 to 50 revolutions per minute. 4.4.2. Cleaning procedure. --The apparatus is filled\napproximately one-third with perchlorethylene to which is added 270 ml of\ndry-cleaning soap. [FN6] The swatches and sufficient suitable worsted cloth, [FN7] in pieces of approximately 12 by 12 inches, to make a total dry load of 1\npound are placed in the apparatus. It is operated for 25 minutes. The solution\nis poured out, the apparatus refilled to approximately one-third with fresh\nperchlorethylene without soap, and the apparatus is operated for an additional\n5 minutes. This last operation is repeated three times. The swatches are then\nremoved and the excess solvent removed from the swatches by any convenient\nmeans, such as rolling them between two layers of turkish toweling or between\ntwo layers of absorbent paper. They are then permitted to dry at room\ntemperature. 4.5 Washing procedure. --The swatches, after being subjected to\nthe dry-cleaning procedure (par. 4.4), shall then be immersed and worked gently\nfor 5 minutes in a bath of soft water in which 0.5-percent neutral chip soap\nhas been dissolved. The volume of the bath shall be 30 times the weight of the\nswatches and the temperature shall be between 95° and 100° F. The\nswatches shall then be rinsed twice in water at 80° F., extracted, and\ndried. The individual specimens, each 2 by 6 inches, are then cut out as\ndescribed in 4.1.5 and tested as described in 4.6 and 4.7. 4.6 Brushing and drying specimens. --Each specimen having a\nraised-fiber surface, in its original condition or after dry cleaning and\nwashing, is placed on the brushing device carriage (par. 4.3) and drawn under\nthe brush once against the lay of the raised-fiber surface (see fig. 4). Other\nspecimens do not require brushing. All specimens are clamped individually in\nthe specimen holders of the flammability tester (par. 4.2.3), with the staple\non top and the stapled end at the closed end of the holder. They are then dried\nin a horizontal position in an oven for 30 minutes at 221° F (105° C), removed from the oven, and placed over anhydrous calcium chloride in a\ndesiccator until cool, but for not less than 15 minutes. Image\n4.7 Procedure for testing flammability. 4.7.1. Adjust the position of the rack of the flammability\ntester (par. 4.2.2) with a holder and trial specimen (not a prepared specimen)\nin position, so that the tip of the indicator finger touches the face of the\nspecimen. 4.7.2. Open the control valve in the fuel supply. Allow, approximately 5 minutes for the air to be drawn from the fuel line, ignite the\ngas, and adjust the flame to a length of 5/8 inch, measured from its tip to the\nopening in the gas nozzle. 4.7.3. Remove the mounted Specimen from the desiccator and place\nit in position on the rack in the chamber of the apparatus. 4.7.4. See that the stop cord (No. 50 cotton sewing thread) is\nstrung through the guides in the upper plate of the specimen holder across the\ntop of the specimen, and through the guides at the rear of the chamber over the\nguide ring, and that the weight is hooked in place close to and just below the\nguide ring. Set the stop watch at zero. Close the door of the apparatus. Conduct the test in a draft-free room with the apparatus at room\ntemperature. 4.7.5. Bring the starting lever over to the extreme right and\nrelease it. This starts the timing mechanism and applies the flame to the\n\nSpecimen for a period of 1 second. This should be done within 45 seconds of the\ntime the specimen was removed from the desiccator. Timing is automatic, starting upon application of the flame and ending when the weight is released\nby the burning of the stop cord. 4.7.6. Record the time of flame spread (reading of stop watch)\nof each specimen and note whether the base of each specimen having a\nraised-fiber surface is ignited or fused to a point where the damage is\napparent from the bottom of the specimen. 4.7.7. Results. 4.7.7.1 Time of flame spread.--The time of flame spread of the\ntextile is taken as an average time for 5 specimens. Results of tests of\nspecimens before and after dry cleaning and washing shall be recorded and\nreported separately. If the time of flame spread is less than 4 seconds or if\nthe specimens do not burn, test 5 additional specimens. The time of flame\nspread is then taken to be the average time for the 10 specimens or for as many\nof them as burn. 4.7.7.2 Base fabric ignition or fusing. --Base fabric ignition\nor fusing of textiles having raised-fiber surfaces shall be reported when the\nbase fabric of more than 1 of the 5 (or 2 of the 10) specimens tested ignites\nor fuses. 4.7.8. Reporting results. --The reported result shall be the\nflammability before or after dry cleaning and washing, whichever is the lower; and, based on this result, the textile shall be placed in the proper\nclassification as given in section 3. 5. NOTES\n5.1 The methods of test and classifications outlined herein\nagree with all essential requirements of the Standard Test Method for\n\nFlammability of Clothing Textiles, of the American Association of Textile\n\nChemists and Colorists. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE\n6.1 Having been passed through the regular procedure of the\n\nCommodity Standards Division, and approved by the acceptors hereinafter listed, this Commercial Standard was issued by the United States Department of\n\nCommerce, effective from January 30, 1953. EDWIN W. ELY, Chief, Commodity Standards Division. Flammability of Clothing Textiles\nCS 191-53\n________\nStatement of the Standing Committee on Commercial Standard CS\n191- 53 in regard to the INTENT\nof the Committee and the PURPOSE of several sections of the\n\nStandard. ________\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Commodity Standards\n\nDivision of the office of Technical Services, and to the Standing Committee for\nthe Commercial Standard CS 191-53, that certain provisions of the Standard are\nnot entirely clear. In a number of cases two or more interpretations are\npossible. The Standing Committee met in New York on December 11, 1953 to\nconsider these sections and after a thorough discussion drew up this Appendix. A copy of it was sent to the Federal Trade Commission on December 15, 1953 for\ntheir information in interpreting the Standard. Since such explanation might\nalso prove beneficial to all segments of the trade concerned with meeting the\nlegal requirements of the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Commodity Standards\n\nDivision is releasing the full text of the Appendix to the trade and to all\nacceptors. The Appendix lists the sections of the Standard which have been\nquestioned and contains statements which clarify the intent of those who\noriginally prepared the Standard. I. Paragraphs 3.1.1.1, 3.1.1.2, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.3.1, and 3.1.3.2\n\nIn each of the above paragraphs, the following statement\nappears: \"Such textiles in their original state and/or after being dry-cleaned\nand washed....\" As written, this statement requires that either the subject\ntextiles shall be tested both in their original state and after being\ndry-cleaned and washed, or indicates that there is an option as to whether said\ntextiles shall be tested in their original state or after being dry-cleaned and\nwashed. This was not the purpose of the Standing Committee in\ndeveloping the above requirements. The intent was that all fabrics should be\ntested in their original state, and in that state meet the requirements set\nforth. The dry-cleaning and washing provision was provided for use whenever a\nfire-retardant finish might be present in the subject textile, in which case, after dry-cleaning and washing, the flammability might be greater than in the\noriginal state. Conversely, when the testing is carried out by the fabric\nmanufacturer, who knows that no fire-retardant finish is present, and that no\nother condition would make the material more flammable after dry-cleaning and\nwashing, it was not intended that the expensive dry-cleaning and washing\noperation should be carried out. In summary, the textiles to which these sections refer would\nalways be tested in their original state as described in Section 4. In the\nabsence of proof that a fire-retardant finish has not been applied, they would\nalso be tested after dry-cleaning and washing as described in Paragraphs 4.4\nand 4.5. II. Paragraphs\n3.1.1.2, 3.1.2.1, and 3.1.3.2\n\nThe terminal phrase in each of these three paragraphs is\nrelated to flame-intensity, one of the factors recognized to bear directly on\npossible or potential hazard in a combustible textile fabric. Through an\noversight, this phrase in Paragraph 3.1.2.1. remains the same as in the April\n3, 1952 draft of the Commercial Standard, then identified as TS-5131. In\n\nParagraph 3.1.3.2 this phrase was changed from \"...the base fabric is ignited\nor fused\" to \"and when the intensity of flame as to ignite or fuse the base\nfabric\". This brought that terminal phrase into agreement with that in 3.1.1.2\nwhich read \"provided the intensity of the flame is so low as not to ignite or\nfuse the base fabric.\"\nThe intent of the Standing Committee to have 3.1.2.1 conform in\nthe above respect with 3.1.3.2 should be understood. However, even the modified\nsentences do not fully clarify the purpose of these references to flame\nintensity. A brief description of the manner in which the specified fabrics\nborn will make the Committee's intent clear. When a fabric having a napped, pile, tufted, or other\nraised-fiber surface burns, two things may occur: (1)\na flame may move across the raised\nfibers, generally rapidly, and\n(2)\nthe base fabric itself may be ignited, if the flaming of the raised filers is\nof sufficient intensity to cause that effect. However, in some cases, the\nigniting flame itself may set fire to the base material, causing it to burn\nrather slowly after the surface flashing of the material has terminated. In\nsuch a case there exists a combination of two types of burning which are\ngenerally considered to constitute no unusual hazard. There is a non-hazardous\nsurface flash which has not enough intensity to ignite the base fabric itself, and there is a rather slow burning, or normal combustion of the fabric\nresulting from ignition by the flame of the tester. The real danger from a\nfabric with a raised-fiber surface results from a rapidly spreading flame which\nhas sufficient intensity to cause the fabric to ignite the base structure over\na wide area. This latter effect can easily be observed in the tester, and\nshould not be confused with occasional freak ignitions of the base fabric as\ndescribed above, where the surface flash may leave little volume or intensity. The intent can be seen in Paragraphs 3.1.1.2 and 3.1.3.2, where\nthe final sentence says \"provided the intensity of flame is such...\"\nTherefore, in testing fabrics as directed in Paragraphs\n3.1.1.2, 3.1.2.1, and 3.1.3.2, the observation of flame intensity should be to\nestablish the fact of whether or not the flaming of the raised-fiber surface\ncauses the base fabric to ignite. III. Paragraph 4.1.4\n\nThis paragraph directs that, when specimens \"do not ignite or\nare very slow burning, or should have a fire-retardant finish\", additional\nspecimens shall be carried trough the dry-cleaning and washing procedure and\nthen re-tested. There are many fabrics which, in their untreated state, will\nnot ignite in the Flammability Tester, or if ignited, will burn slowly. It was\nnot the purpose of this paragraph to require that such materials be carried\nthrough a dry-cleaning and washing procedure. Instead, the intent was to\nrequire that any fabric which might have received a fire-retardant treatment be\ncarried through the dry-cleaning and washing procedure as an assurance that\nsuch a finish would not be readily removed in service. In other words, this is\nanother case of the dry-cleaning and washing provision being incorporated as a\nsafeguard against fugitive fire-retardant finishes, with no intent that the\ndry-cleaning and washing should be a testing requirement if it is known that\nthe fabric has not been given a fire-retardant treatment. In summary, this section has the same intent as Section 3, which was reviewed above. All textiles will be tested in their original state, and testing after dry-cleaning and washing will only be carried out in the\nabsence of proof that a fire-retardant finish has not been applied. IV. Paragraph 4.7.6\n\nAs noted, the intensity or volume of flame in a burning textile\nfabric was recognized by the Standing Committee to be one of the important\nfactors relating the manner in which the fabric burns to its potential hazard\nwhen used as a garment. It was felt that a flame which had insufficient\nintensity or volume to ignite the base material itself would not transmit\nsufficient heat, or flame, through the fabric to the body. Therefore, the\ncommittee provided that, to be considered hazardous, a fabric must not only\nexhibit rapid flame spread, but also must show sufficient intensity or volume\nof flame so that the basic fabric structure itself will be ignited by that\nflame. Paragraph 4.7.6 shows how base fabric ignition is to be\nobserved. The purpose here was to examine the fabric on the reverse side from\nthe face to which the testing flame was applied. Any evidence of scorching or\nfusing of fibers on the opposite face to that which was ignited would be\nconsidered evidence of base fabric ignition. The term \"bottom of the specimen\" is confusing; the term \"back\nor reverse side\" would be preferable since the 45° mounting of the specimen\npermits another interpretation of \"bottom\". In summary, the purpose of 4.7.6 is to require the notation of\nwhether the fabric is ignited or fused by the spreading surface flame to a\npoint where the damage is apparent on the surface of the specimen opposite to\nthat which was ignited. V. Paragraph 4.7.7.1\n\nThis paragraph requires that, where the time of flame spread is\nless than 4 seconds, or where the specimens do not burn, five additional\nspecimens shall be tested. There are two parts of this requirement, and since\nthe intent was different for each part, they will be explained\nseparately. The basic purpose of this section is to provide for the testing\nof additional specimens in case of doubt as to the proper classification of the\nfabric. It is expected that very few fabrics will be hazardous and burn in less\ntime than 4 seconds, because manufacturers will avoid such constructions. When\nsuch an unusual fabric is encountered, however, it was deemed advisable that an\nadditional five specimens he tested to provide a better basis from which an\naverage time of burning could be obtained. Furthermore, sometimes fabrics which\nburn with rapid surface flash will show a \"freak\" ignition of the base fabric. If such ignition occurs in only one or two of the specimens, the additional\nfive specimens are provided for to show whether or not such base fabric\nignition is indeed a characteristic of the fabric. The second part of the requirement in 4.7.7.1 states that \"if\nthe specimens do not burn, test five additional specimens.\" This was not\nintended to apply to any fabric in which none of the specimens burned. There\nare a great many fabrics which will not burn in the Flammability Tester and\nthere is no point in testing ten strips when none of the first five burns. This\nprovision was intended for those cases in which one to four of the first five\nstrips burn. In many cases a reliable average burning time cannot be obtained, so an additional five strips are taken to provide the basis for a more\nsatisfactory average. This is made clear at the end of the paragraph, in the\nstatement \"The time of flame spread is then taken to be the average time for\nthe ten specimens or for as many of them as burn.\"\nThe first sentence in Paragraph 4.7.7.1 indicates that the\nstandard number of specimens required for a test is five. This is also pointed\nout in Paragraph 4.1.1, which states that five specimens are required for each\ntest. Five additional specimens are only required where the presence of a\nfire-retardant finish is suspected, where some but not all of the first five\nspecimens burn, and where the burning time is less than 4 seconds. To summarize, then, two conditions call for the testing of an\nadditional five specimens. First, if the first five show a burning time of less\nthan 4 seconds with one or two strips showing base fabric ignition. Second, if\nsome but not all of the first five strips burn, and when the burning time of\nthe strips that do burn is close to the 4-second limit, so that an additional\nfive strips would be desirable as the basis for a more reliable average. * * *\nThe testing of fabrics under Commercial Standard 191-53 and\nunder the Flammable Fabrics Act will necessarily be an expensive operation for\ncertain textile manufacturers. A misunderstanding of the Commercial Standard, which would require testing 10 or 20 specimens instead of the 5 which were\ndeemed adequate in many cases, would impose an unjustified burden and expense\non such manufacturers.
