  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 508.8 - Standards and periodicity\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Provision of care and\nservices. The periodicity schedule contained in this section and\nthe contents of the C/THP examination generally follow those recommended by the\n\nCommittee on Standards of Child Health of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Appropriate modifications in the content of the examination can be made\naccording to the attending physician's medical judgment, consistent with the\nneeds of the individual child and current recommended standards of medical\npractice. (b) Contents of an examination. Every C/THP examination should include the following as\nappropriate by age: (1)\n\nComprehensive\nhealth history. (i) (a) For a new patient, a complete family\nhistory, social history, past medical history, and review of body systems must\nbe obtained and recorded. (b) When\nobtaining the comprehensive health history of children five years of age or\nyounger, the history must include details of pregnancy, delivery, birth weight\nand the neonatal period. (c) When\nobtaining the comprehensive health history of adolescents, a review of the body\nsystems should also include a history of sexual activity and use of\ncontraception and a menstrual history for females. (d) For patients whose initial histories have\nalready been recorded by the C/THP provider, the family, social and medical\nhistories may be confined to the period since the histories were last\nrecorded. (ii)\n\nThe\nhistories may be obtained initially by health assistants, provided the C/THP\nprovider reviews and supplements the histories at the time the provider\nconducts his or her examination of the child. (2)\n\nComprehensive physical examination. The examination of a person eligible for C/THP services\nmust be performed by a licensed physician or by a physician's assistant or\nregistered professional nurse qualified to provide primary care services under\na physician's supervision, and is to consist of a systematic examination of all\nparts of the body, including appropriate neurological, dental, otoscopic and\nfunduscopic examinations and observation of the back for scoliosis. Results of\nthe physical examination must be recorded in the medical record by body\nregions. Blood pressure measurements must be taken for all children three years\nof age and older. (3)\n\nAssessment of physical growth and nutritional status. Height and weight for all persons eligible for C/THP\nservices, as well as head circumference for infants, are to be measured and\nrecorded at each examination. Measurements of height and weight through the\nfifth year of age, and of head circumference through one year of age and again\nat two years of age, should be plotted on a standard growth chart, which is to\nbe incorporated into the medical record. Plotting of measurements for older\nchildren and adolescents is recommended but not required. (4)\n\nAssessment of mental and psychosocial\ndevelopment. (i) For children through five\nyears of age, a detailed developmental history of the infant or child must be\nobtained and documented in the child's medical record. The history should\ninclude information relating to speech, cognitive, emotional, psychosocial and\ngross and fine motor development. Administration of a standardized (formal)\ndevelopmental screening test, such as the Denver Developmental Screening Test\n(DDST) or the abbreviated DDST, is recommended but not required. The child's\nhealth status must also be updated at each periodic visit in such a way as to\nallow for serial evaluation. (ii)\n\nFor children 6 to 12 years of age, an assessment of the psychosocial adjustment\nshould include a discussion of school performance and peer and family\nrelationships. (iii)\n\nFor\nadolescents 13 years of age and older, an assessment of the psychosocial\nadjustment should include a discussion of peer and family relationships, school/job performance, use of drugs, alcohol or tobacco and sexual\npreparedness and activity. (5)\n\nVision testing. (i) For children less than three years of\nage, testing should include the following elements: (a) Observation of the infant's/child's\nreaction to an object of interest such as a light or familiar toy for gross\nindication of vision. Each eye is required to be observed separately. (b) Motility screening, including gross\ninspection of the eye to determine the presence of any obvious strabismus, and\nthe cover test, which is especially valuable in patients with a small deviation\nfrom the norm. (ii)\n\nFor\nchildren three years of age and older, testing for visual acuity is to be\nperformed and repeated at each examination and must include a distant visual\nacuity test, which can be performed using the Snellen letter or Symbol E chart. The use of alternative tests (HOTV or Matching Symbol, Faye Symbol, Allen\n\nPictures) should be considered for those preschoolers who cannot be tested by\nthe Snellen letter or Symbol E chart. (iii)\n\nIf a child wears eyeglasses, an\nassessment regarding the need for optometric reevaluation should be made based\non screening the child with eyeglasses and the length of time since the last\noptometric evaluation. (6)\n\nHearing testing. (i) For children less than three years of\nage, infant hearing should be tested grossly by the use of loud noises. Deafness must be seriously suspected if there is a delay in development in\nspeech in the older infant. (ii)\n\nFor children three years of age and older, testing which consists of a manually\nadministered, individual, pure-tone conduction screening procedure should be\nprovided at each examination. (iii)\n\nIn all instances when hearing impairment is suspected by the medical provider\nbased upon testing or an evaluation of the child's risk of hearing impairment, a prompt referral to an approved speech and hearing center must be\nmade. (7)\n\nAssessment of\nimmunization status and provision of immunizations. (i) An assessment of the record of\nimmunizations given in the past for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, rubella, measles and mumps must be recorded. If the dates of the child's\nprevious immunizations are available, they should be recorded in the child's\nmedical chart. If the immunization history is based on parents' reports, efforts to verify this information must be made. Such efforts must be\nrecorded. (ii)\n\nPersons eligible for\nC/THP services should be immunized in accordance with the following schedules: (a) Schedule for children beginning\nimmunization in infancy. Age\n\nVaccines\n\nComments\n2 months\nDTP\nDTP = diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, TOPV\nTOPV = trivalent oral polio vaccine. 4 months\nDTP, TOPV\n6 months\nDTP\nAn optional dose of TOPV may be given. 15 months\n\nMeasles Mumps Rubella\n\nOne dose of combined measles/mumps/rubella (MMR)\nvaccine is preferred; a tuberculin skin test may be administered at the same\nvisit. 18 months\nDTP TOPV Hib\n\nHib = Haemophilus influenzae type b disease\nimmunization of children at 18 months may be considered in known high-risk\ngroups. 24 months\n\nHib\n\nHib immunization of all children is recommended at\nthis age. 4-6 years (school entry)\nDTP TOPV\nWhile often referred to as \"boosters\" these doses\nconstitute an essential part of the immunization process. 14-16 years\n\nTd\nTd = Tetanus and diphtheria for adults; repeat\nevery 10 years. (b) Schedules for children not immunized as\ninfants. (1)\n\nAge 13 months through 6 years. Visit\n\nVaccines\n\nComments\nDTP TOPV\nMMR may be substituted; see\ncomment for visit 2. One-month interval between visits. 2\n\nMeasles Mumps Rubella\nMMR should\nbe given at first visit when risk of exposure is high; DTP and TOPV may then be\nstarted at second visit and interval between visits 2 and 3 extended to two\nmonths. One-month interval between visits. 3\nDTP, TOPV\nTwo-month interval between visits. 4\nDTP\nAn optional dose of TOPV may\nalso be given. 6- to 12-month interval between\nvisits. DTP TOPV\nInterval between visits 4 and 5\nmay be extended\n(e.g., school entry), but not shortened. 10-year interval between visits. 6\n\nTd\n\nRepeat every 10 years. The Hib vaccine can be provided any time from 24 months\nup to five years of age. (2)\n\nAges 7 years through 20 years. Visit\n\nVaccines\n\nComments\n1\n\nMeasles Mumps\n\nRubella\n*\nOne dose of Td and one dose of TOPV\nmay also be given at this visit if circumstances warrant (see simultaneus\nadministration of vaccines). One-month interval between visits. 2\n\nTd\nTOPV\n**\nThis visit may be eliminated if first\ndoses of Td and TOPV are given at visit 1. Two-month interval between visits. 3\n\nTd\nTOPV\n**\nIf visit 2 is eliminated, the\ninterval between visits 1 and 3 must be at least two months. 6- to 12-month interval between\nvisits. 4\n\nTd\nTOPV\n**\nInterval between doses 3 and 4 may be\nextended but not shortened. 10-year interval between visits. 5\n\nTd\n\nRepeat every 10 years. *\nBefore rubella vaccine is\nadministered to females past menarche, the patient and/or her parent/guardian\nmust be asked if she is pregnant. Pregnant patients must not be given rubella\nvaccine. If the patient is not pregnant, the theoretical risks to a fetus and\nthe importance of not becoming pregnant for three months following vaccination\nmust be explained to the patient before the vaccine is administered. **\nTOPV should not be routinely\nadministered to persons 18 years of age and older. (3)\n\nSimultaneous administration of vaccines. The simultaneous administration of TOPV and one of the following has been shown\nto be both safe and effective: MMR, MR, measles, rubella, mumps, DTP, Td. It is\nalso possible to administer TOPV, MMR (or a product containing one or more of\nits component antigens), and either DTP or Td simultaneously (using different\ninjection sites). This latter practice is warranted if there is doubt that the\nrecipient will return for further doses of vaccine or if an older, seriously\nunder-immunized child must be brought up-to-date quickly\n(\ne.g., at the time of school entry). The Hib vaccine can be\nprovided any time between the ages of 24 months and six years. (4)\n\nInterruption of immunization schedule. When a delay between doses does not interfere with final immunity and does not\nnecessitate starting the series over again, regardless of the interval elapsed, the schedule may simply be resumed where it was left off. (8)\n\nLaboratory and\nother diagnostic tests. If a particular test (\ne.g., lead\nscreening) is not indicated for a specific age group (or any age group), but\nthe child presents history or symptoms calling for the test's use, the test\nshould be performed. (i) Tuberculin\nscreening. The assessment for tuberculin risk should be made at each visit, with skin tests performed at age 12-13 months, three years and at each age\ninterval thereafter. A tuberculin test should be administered prior to\nimmunizing a child against measles. If that is not possible, the tuberculin\ntest should be administered simultaneously with the measles vaccine. A\ntuberculin test should be delayed at least six weeks after the administration\nof a measles vaccine. Where the child's histories indicate a higher risk of\ntuberculosis, the test should be administered more frequently. (ii)\n\nIf the phenylketonuria (PKU) test was\nnot performed at birth, because, for example, the baby was born out-of-state, the PKU test should be performed at the first C/THP exam (within one\nmonth). (iii)\n\nSickle cell\nscreening. Those who are at risk of sickle cell disease must receive sickle\ncell screening. If the clinician makes the judgment that the child is not at\nrisk (by ethnicity or previous screening), a statement of the assessment should\nappear in the child's medical record. Children born in hospitals within New\n\nYork State after 1975 are assumed to be adequately screened for sickle cell\ndisease. If the child is at risk of sickle cell disease and there is any doubt\nabout previous testing, sickle cell screening should be provided as part of the\nexam. (iv)\n\nAnemia screening. A test\nfor anemia must be done at age 9-10 months, 23-25 months, 3 years, 4 years, 5\nyears, 6 years, and repeated routinely at each age interval as set forth in\nsubdivision (f) of this section. High-risk infants under nine months should\nalso be tested. Where the child's histories indicate a higher risk, the test\nshould be administered more frequently. (v) Lead screening. Lead screening must be\nperformed routinely on all children aged nine months through five years and at\nother times judged appropriate by the provider. Education for the prevention of\nlead poisoning should be directed toward the parent at the time the child is\nfirst screened and at subsequent visits. (vi)\n\nVenereal disease screening. Adolescents\naged 13 years and older must be assessed for the need for serological screening\nfor syphilis, and all sexually active females should be offered a routine\ngynecological examination, pap smear, gonococcal culture and counseling\nregarding the prevention of unplanned pregnancies. If the provider is not\nproperly equipped to perform these services, referral to a gynecologist, family\nplanning or obstetrical/gynecological clinic is recommended. (9)\n\nUrine screening. A urinalysis must be performed at age three years and\nrepeated at each age interval set forth in subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (10)\n\nDental care\nassessment. All children up to age three should have their mouths\nexamined at each medical evaluation and, where appropriate, should be referred\nfor dental care. All children aged three years and over should be referred to a\ndentist or a dental program for diagnostic evaluation and necessary treatment, unless the child has been to a dentist in compliance with the C/THP examination\nschedule as set forth in subdivision (f) of this section. (11)\n\nDiagnosis and treatment follow-up. A summary diagnosis and plan for treatment or referral\nand follow-up must be recorded in each child's medical record. Diagnostic and\ntreatment services must be given at the time of the C/THP examination, if\nappropriate. If a finding requires more extensive diagnosis and/or treatment\nthan is immediately available, an appointment for these services must be\nscheduled within 60 days of the C/THP examination. The referring physician or\nclinic is responsible for follow-up, and results of the diagnostic evaluation\nshould be documented in the medical records. (12)\n\nObservation for child abuse and neglect. Suspected cases of child abuse and maltreatment must be\nreported to the New York State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment\npursuant to the provisions of section\n413\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law. (c) Continuity of care. The C/THP provider should be available not only for\ninitial and periodic C/THP examinations, but also for illness-related\nservices. (d) Consultation. Consultation with other medical providers should be\nobtained when deemed necessary by the C/THP provider. (e) Referral for further diagnosis\nand/or treatment. When a C/THP examination reveals abnormal conditions and\nfollow-up care is deemed necessary by the C/THP provider, such care must be\nprovided or arranged. Referral to appropriate providers must be made for\nservices which the C/THP provider does not provide. Identification of a\ncondition requiring further diagnosis or treatment during a C/THP examination\nmust be indicated by completion of the CHAP referral code on the claim form\nsubmitted for payment. (f) The following periodicity schedule will apply to all C/THP examinations: (1)\n0-1 year-within 1 month; 2-3 months; 4-5\nmonths; 6-7 months; 9-10 months. (2)\n1-6 years-12-13 months; 14-15 months; 16-19 months; 23-24 months; 3 years; 4 years; 5 years. (3)\n6-21 years-6 years; 8-9 years; 10-11\nyears; 12-13 years; 14-15 years; 16-17 years; 18-19 years; 20 years. (g) Nonscheduled\nexamination. When a C/THP examination is requested for a child at an\nage which does not appear on the periodicity schedule contained in subdivision\n(f) of this section, the provider should, at a minimum, perform those\ncomponents of the C/THP examination which are required by the last periodic\nexamination the child should have received. (h) Incomplete required\nexamination. Submission of a claim for a C/THP examination assumes\nthat the provider has taken responsibility to assure that the examination was\ncomplete. If the provider cannot complete a recommended component of the\nexamination at the time of the initial examination, every effort should be made\nto complete the examination at a date determined to be appropriate by the\nprovider.
