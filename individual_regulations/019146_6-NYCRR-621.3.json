(a) General\nrequirements for complete application. To be determined complete for the\npurpose of commencing department review, the application must meet the\nrequirements in section\n621.4\nof this Part and the\nfollowing requirements: (1)\n\nThe application\nmust include the following items: (i) properly\ncompleted department application form(s); (ii)\na map with the location of the project\nclearly identified; (iii)\nfor\nprojects involving construction, plans or drawings with sufficient detail to\nshow: (a) the existing and proposed\nconditions, including the locations of all existing and proposed structures, including any new or modified utilities; (b) the limits of all site disturbance and\ngrading; (c) locations of property\nlines; (d) the date and name of the\npreparer; (e) locations of\ntemporary work areas and equipment access; (f) locations and types of measures that will\nbe used to control pollution (e.g., erosion control); and\n(g) all information that may be required on\nplans or drawings in specific program implementing regulations. (iv)\nfor projects involving\noperation of a facility regulated under this Part, all operational manuals, plans, and engineering documents necessary to describe the full scope of\nregulated activities and the environmental controls necessary to meet the\nrelevant pollution control limits, including any information that may be\nrequired in specific program implementing regulations; (v) Engineers certifying documents must be\nlicensed in New York State. (vi)\n\nLandowner permission for DEC staff to access the project or facility site for\npurposes described in subdivision\n621.6\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (vii)\n\nAny additional\nsupporting documentation or supplemental information required by the specific\nprogram implementing regulations and this Part. (2)\n\nThe department may ask for information\nfrom the applicant to determine who may be a legally responsible party for\ncompliance with the permit, the ECL, other applicable laws administered by the\ndepartment, for remediation of environmental degradation, and to determine the\nappropriate financial security which may be required. Any false written\nstatements knowingly made are punishable pursuant to Penal Law, section\n210.45. (3)\n\nThe department may require the applicant\nto submit and carry out a public participation plan that would include the\napplicant conducting public participation meetings before an application is\ndetermined or deemed to be complete This is in addition to any public notice or\nhearing that may otherwise be required under this part. The public\nparticipation plan is intended to enhance community awareness of the project. It may include various means of communication with the affected public through\ndifferent media, and local outreach actions, including distributing project\ninformation in the community, and conducting public project information\nmeetings in appropriate languages. (4)\n\nWhen a project requires multiple\ndepartment permits, all applications must be submitted simultaneously or the\napplicant must demonstrate to the department's satisfaction that there is good\ncause not to do so. (5)\n\nWhen an\napplicant seeks a variance from permit standards or prohibitions that are\nspecified in a program's regulations, the application must include a specific\nrequest, supporting information and justification for the variance as required\nby the program's regulations. (6)\n\nWhen a project requires permits or approvals from another state agency or a\nlocal government, the application must list those permits or approvals and give\nthe status of each application and its review under SEQR. (7)\n\nIf a project is subject to article 8 of\nthe ECL (SEQR), the department must satisfy the requirements of Part 617 of\nthis Title. A complete application must include a completed environmental\nassessment form and, (i) when a lead agency\nhas been established pursuant to article 8 of the ECL, either\n(a) a negative declaration, or conditioned\nnegative declaration that has been filed pursuant to article 8 of the ECL; or\n(b) a draft environmental impact\nstatement (DEIS) that has been accepted by the lead agency for public\nreview; (ii)\nwhere the\ndepartment is the lead agency, or is the only involved agency, and has required\na DEIS, a determination by the department that the DEIS is acceptable for\npublic review; or\n(iii)\nfor\nprojects where uncoordinated review occurs, a negative declaration is issued by\nthe department. (8)\n\nWhen\nan action requires a determination by the Office of Parks, Recreation and\n\nHistoric Preservation pursuant to section\n14.09\nof the Parks, Recreation and\n\nHistoric Preservation Law (New York State Historic Preservation Act of 1980), the application is not complete until the Office of Parks, Recreation and\n\nHistoric Preservation has made a determination whether: (i) any historic, architectural, archeological, or cultural resources present in the project impact area are\nsignificant (listed on or eligible for listing on the State or National\n\nRegister of Historic Places); and\n(ii)\nthe project may have any impacts on such\nsignificant resources. (9)\n\nIf a project is a Type I or Unlisted\naction pursuant to SEQR and is located in a coastal area designated according\nto article 42 of the Executive Law and 19 NYCRR Part\n600, the application is\nnot complete until sufficient information has been provided to enable the\ndepartment to complete a coastal assessment form as prescribed by the Secretary\nof State. (10)\nA project located\nwithin the Adirondack Park requiring a department permit may also require\npermits from the Adirondack Park Agency, or the New York State Department of\n\nHealth, or both. In such a case, the application for a department permit is not\ncomplete until the applicant has submitted complete applications to all\nagencies for all required permits, and SEQR requirements of all other agencies\nare fulfilled, or until the applicant demonstrates good cause not to do\nso. (11)\n\nThe Climate Leadership and\n\nCommunity Protection Act (CLCPA) requires the department to consider whether\nits permitting decisions subject to this Part are inconsistent with, or will\ninterfere with, the attainment of the statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emission\nlimits established in Article 75 of the ECL and reflected in Part 496 of this\n\nTitle. Therefore, where applicable, the applicant must provide information to\nexplain whether the project will be inconsistent with, or will interfere with, the attainment of statewide GHG emission limits. An application is incomplete\nuntil such information is provided to the department. (12)\n\nThe Community Risk and Resiliency Act\n(CRRA) requires that applicants for major permits subject to this Part, where\napplicable, demonstrate that future physical climate risk has been considered. An application is incomplete until the required demonstration is provided to\nthe department. (13)\n\nThe\n\nEnvironmental Justice Act of 2019 and CLCPA require the department to consider\nenvironmental justice concerns in permitting decisions subject to this Part and\nprovide enhanced public participation opportunities. Therefore, where\napplicable, an application is incomplete until the following information is\nprovided to the department: (i) an enhanced\npublic participation plan; and\n(ii)\nadditional information deemed necessary by the department to evaluate and, where necessary, mitigate environmental impacts on the identified environmental\njustice area(s) or disadvantaged communities. (14)\n\nFor further information concerning\ncompleteness, see section\n621.6\nof this Part; and for further\ncompleteness criteria for specific permits covered by this Part, see section\n621.4\nof this Part. (15)\n\nAn application is incomplete until the\napplicant, and the property owner if different than the applicant, consents to\nprovide the department access for inspection of the project site or facility. Such inspections may be necessary for review-related reasons, including to\nconfirm environmental conditions, assess potential effects, and determine\nwhether the project satisfies permitting standards. (b) Minor Projects. (1)\n\nThe department has identified certain\nactivities as minor, as listed in section\n621.4\nof this Part. Minor projects\nusually have an insignificant environmental impact. However, it is necessary to\nregulate such activities due to the potential for abuse of natural resources, the necessity for monitoring related activities, and the possible cumulative\neffect of minor actions which individually are environmentally\ninsignificant. (2)\n\nMinor projects\nare not normally subject to the public notice requirements of section\n621.7\nof this Part and may be\nprocessed faster than major projects as explained in section\n621.10\nof this Part. (3)\n\nIf the department determines that a minor\nproject requires public notice, may have a significant impact on the\nenvironment under SEQR or requires a public comment hearing, the project will\nthereafter be processed as a major project for purposes of this Part. (4)\n\nWhen a project involves simultaneous\npermit application for both major and minor activities, all are processed as\nmajor for purposes of this Part. (5)\n\nWhen a project involves simultaneous\npermit applications for multiple activities, all of which are minor, all are\nprocessed as minor for purposes of this Part unless it is determined that the\nproject may have a significant impact under SEQR, requires public notice, or a\npublic comment hearing pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (c) Where a project involves\npermits both subject and not subject to this Part, the department reserves the\nright to process all such applications pursuant to this Part. (d) Joint proceedings. In some instances, government agencies other than the department may have concurrent jurisdiction\nover an application for a permit under this Part. The commissioner may enter\ninto agreements with such agencies for joint processing of the application, including provision for joint notices and hearings. The department may require\nthe applicant to provide a copy of the permit application directly to another\ngovernment agency to facilitate joint processing. (e) The department may suspend review of an\napplication when an enforcement proceeding or action is formally commenced\nagainst an applicant for alleged violations of a provision of the ECL, regulation or permit, or any environmental law administered by the department. The alleged violations must be related to the activity for which the permit is\nsought or to other provisions of law administered by the department and have\noccurred at the facility or site that is the subject of the application or at a\nsite owned or controlled by the applicant. (1)\n\nThe applicant must be informed of the suspension in writing and provided with a\ncopy of the complaint. (2)\n\nThe\napplication may be suspended until the enforcement action has been resolved\nthrough an order on consent, Commissioner's or judicial order and any necessary\ncompliance obligations are fulfilled to the department's\nsatisfaction. (3)\n\nNo such\nsuspension releases the department from the requirement to make a final\ndecision on title V facility permit applications within 18 months of the date\nthat the application was complete pursuant to title V of the CAA (see section\n200.9\nof this Title) and this\n\nPart. (f) Where the\ndepartment determines an application is submitted for a project already\ncompleted without the required permits, the department may summarily dismiss\nthe application without further review or procedures under this Part and, at\nits option, refer the matter for enforcement proceedings, which may be\nundertaken at the discretion of the department. (g) Time frames and due dates in this Part\nare calculated in accordance with the General Construction Law, article 2, section 20. Unless indicated otherwise in this Part, days are calculated as\ncalendar days. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
