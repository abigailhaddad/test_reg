  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 346.1 - Background; period during which covered employees may elect benefit improvement\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection\n384-e\nof the Retirement and Social\n\nSecurity Law, which was enacted pursuant to chapter 453 of the Laws of 1988, provides a benefit improvement which may be adopted by employers who have\npreviously adopted the section 384-d optional twenty year plan. The section\n384-e benefit improvement provides an additional pension component equal to one\nsixtieth of final average salary; provided, however, that the total allowance\npayable shall not exceed three quarters of the member's final average salary. An employer's adoption of the section 384-e benefit improvement entitles all\nindividuals who are in their employ and enrolled in the 384-d plan during the\n\"coverage period\" to elect the section 384-e improvement. All such employees\nmay elect the benefit improvement by filing an election with the Comptroller at\nany time during their current employment with that employer and while enrolled\nin the section 384-d plan. The employer establishes a \"coverage period\" by so\nproviding in the election to provide the benefit, which the employer must file\nwith the Comptroller. This Part shall provide the procedure under which\nemployers may file an election to provide the section 384-e benefit improvement\nand the guidelines with respect for establishing a \"coverage period.\"\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n346.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
