Tit. 9 § 463.5 - Commercial moving expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn eligible person occupying a business, farm operation\nor a nonprofit organization will be reimbursed for actual, reasonable and\nnecessary moving expenses; actual, reasonable and necessary expenses in\nsearching for a replacement site; and actual direct losses of tangible personal\nproperty in moving or discontinuing the operation or activity. (a) The eligible person shall notify the\noffice, eight weeks prior to the starting date of the move, of his definite\nintentions regarding the manner and method of moving. At the option of the\noffice, personnel of the office may conduct an inventory of personal property\nand merchandise to be moved, including a description of each phase of the work\nto be performed and an explanation of any unusual or peculiar circumstances\nthat will be pertinent to arriving at a comprehensive cost of moving figure. The address of the appropriated property, address the eligible person is moving\nto and the approximate distance between is to be included therein. This\ninventory is to be signed by the eligible person and is to be supplied to all\nestimators and bidders for each phase of the work, and they are to base their\nestimates and bids on removal of the items listed therein. The occupant may, at\nhis own expense, obtain competitive bids on the costs of moving and may submit\na competitive self-move bid on all or a portion of the removal. (b) Actual costs must be documented upon\nreceipted, detailed bills from recognized movers, skilled craftsman, and are\nnot to exceed the total of the lowest acceptable bids or estimates obtained on\neach phase of the move. (c) Estimates and bids on each phase of the move shall be obtained by the office\nfrom generally recognized, qualified movers and skilled craftsmen. Upon receipt\nand review of all estimates and bids, the office will determine the lowest\nacceptable bid. This bid will be sent to the eligible person, advising him to\ncommence moving and setting forth the limits of reimbursement and the time and\nmanner in which payment will be made. After the removal has been accomplished, actual costs must be documented by detailed, receipted bills from recognized\nmovers, skilled craftsmen, and are not to exceed the approved amount based on a\ntotal of the lowest acceptable bids or estimates obtained on each phase of the\nmove. All bids from movers and craftsmen must be submitted in accordance with\nsection\n463.6\nof this Part. (d) In the case of a\nself-move, the owner of a relocated business may be paid an amount, to be\nnegotiated between the State and the business, not to exceed the lower of two\nfirm bids or estimates obtained by the State from qualified moving\nfirms. (e) When personal property\nwhich is used in connection with the business to be moved is of low value and\nhigh bulk and the estimated cost of moving would be disproportionate in\nrelation to the value, the State may negotiate with the owner for an amount not\nto exceed the difference between the cost of replacement of comparable item(s)\non the market and the amount which would probably have been received for the\nitem(s) on liquidation. (f) All\nbooks and records kept by eligible persons shall be subject to review and audit\nby a State representative during reasonable business hours. (g) Payment of moving expenses is based upon\nthe preapproval of estimates and bids submitted to the office before commencing\nthe move. If, due to extraordinary circumstances, a move is completed without\nsubmitting necessary bids, the commissioner may, upon receipt of sufficient\nwritten justification for failure to submit estimates, pay reasonable and\nnecessary actual expenses upon verification and support for the expenses\nincurred.
