  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 519.2 - Authority\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Who may impose\nnon-judicial punishment. Unless otherwise specified in this Part, any commander\nis authorized to exercise the disciplinary powers conferred by section\n130.15. (1)\n\nThe term commander, as used in this\nsection, is a commissioned or warrant officer who, by virtue of his or her\ngrade and assignment, exercises primary command authority over a military\norganization or prescribed territorial area that under pertinent official\ndirectives is recognized as a command. (2)\n\nIn the case of Active Guard/Reserve (AGR)\npersonnel, commander includes the lowest level supervisor of an AGR member at\nhis work station who is a commissioned or warrant officer. (3)\n\nThe words \"imposing commander\" refers to\nthe commander or other officer who actually imposes the non-judicial\npunishment. (4)\n\nCommands include\nthe following: (i) companies, troops and\nbatteries; (ii)\nnumbered units and\ndetachments; (iii)\nmissions; (iv)\nservice\nschool; (v) area\ncommands; (vi)\nwork station (in the\ncase of AGR personnel). (5)\n\nCommands also include, in general, any\nother organization of the kind mentioned in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, the commander of which is the one looked to by superior authority as the\nindividual chiefly responsible for maintaining discipline in that organization. Thus, an infantry company, whether or not separate or detached, N.Y.R.C.M. 504(b)(2), is considered to be a command. However, an infantry platoon that is\npart of a company and is not separate or detached is not considered to be a\ncommand. Although a commissioned or warrant officer exercising command is\nusually designated as the commander, this position may be designated by various\nother titles having the same official connotation; e.g., commandant, chief of\nmission or work supervisor. (6)\n\nThe\ndetachment commander in HHD, STARC will obtain the recommendation of the\nappropriate DMNA director before imposing non-judicial punishment on an AGR\nmember who is a full-time DMNA employee. (b) Persons upon whom non-judicial punishment\nmay be imposed. Military personnel of his or her command. A commander may\nimpose punishment as authorized under section\n130.15\nupon commissioned\nofficers, warrant officers and other military personnel of his or her command. (1)\n\nFor the purpose of section\n130.15, military personnel are considered to be \"of the command\" of a commander if they\nare: (i) Assigned to an organization\ncommanded by him or her. (ii)\n\nAffiliated with the command (by attachment, detail, TDY, AGR personnel or\notherwise) under conditions, either expressed or implied, which indicate that\nthe commander and the commander of the unit to which they are assigned, is to\nexercise administrative or disciplinary authority over them. (2)\n\nUnder circumstances similar to\nsubparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision, a commander may be assigned\nterritorial command responsibility so that all or certain military personnel in\nthe area will be considered to be of his or her command for the purpose of\nsection\n130.15. (3)\n\nTo determine if\nan individual is \"of the command\" of a particular commanding officer, refer\nfirst to those written or oral orders or directives that affect the status of\nthe individual. If orders or directives do not expressly confer authority to\nadminister non-judicial punishment to the commander of the unit with which\nservice member is affiliated or present (as when, for example, they contain no\nprovision attaching the member \"for disciplinary purposes\"), consider all\nattendant circumstances, such as: (i) the\nphraseology used in the orders; (ii)\nwhere the member slept, ate, was paid, performed duty, the duration of the status, and other similar\nfactors; (iii)\nwhether the member\nis Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) under title 32, section 502(f), and is assigned\nto a certain work station on a full-time basis which is different from his\nparent unit; (iv)\nwhether the\ncommander exercises the usual responsibilities and attributes of command over\nthe member. (4)\n\nIf\norders or directives include such terms as \"attached for administration of\nmilitary justice\", or simply \"attached for administration\", the individual so\nattached will be considered to be of the command of the commander of the unit\nof attachment for the purpose of section\n130.15. (5)\n\nTermination of status. Non-judicial\npunishment will not be imposed upon an individual by a commander after the\nindividual ceases to be of his or her command, because of transfer or\notherwise. However, if section\n130.15\nproceedings have been instituted and\npunishment has not been imposed prior to the time of change of assignment, the\ncommander who instituted the proceedings may forward the record of proceedings\nto the gaining commander for appropriate disposition. (c) Minor offenses. Generally, the term\n\"minor\" includes misconduct involving a lesser degree of criminality than is\ninvolved in the average offense tried by SCM. Violations of or failures to obey\ngeneral orders or regulations may be minor offenses if the prohibited conduct\nitself is of a minor nature even though also prohibited by a general order or\nregulation. (d) Multiple punishment\nprohibited. Several minor offenses arising out of substantially the same\noffense, act or conduct will not be made the basis of separate actions under\nsection\n130.15. (e) Punishment\nafter exercise of jurisdiction by civil authorities. Non-judicial punishment\nmay be imposed upon a member who has been tried in a civil court for the same\nact if the exercise of section\n130.15\njurisdiction would promote the efficiency\nof the service. (f) Statute of\nlimitations. No punishment shall be imposed under ML, 130.15 for any offense\ncommitted more than two years before the imposition of such\npunishment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
