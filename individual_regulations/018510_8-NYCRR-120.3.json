  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 120.3 - Unsafe school choice\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach local educational agency shall ensure that any student\nwho attends a persistently dangerous public elementary or secondary school, as\ndetermined by the Commissioner pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, or\nwho is a victim of a violent criminal offense, as defined pursuant to\nsubdivision (b) of this section, that occurred on the grounds of a public\nelementary or secondary school that the student attends, shall be allowed to\nattend a safe public school at the same grade level within the local\neducational agency. For purposes of this section, a safe public school shall\nmean a public school that has not been designated by the Commissioner as a\npersistently dangerous public elementary or secondary school. (a) Persistently dangerous schools. Pursuant\nto guidelines to be developed by the Commissioner in consultation with a\nrepresentative sample of local educational agencies, the Commissioner shall\ndetermine which public elementary and secondary schools are persistently\ndangerous. A determination that a school is persistently dangerous shall be\nbased upon objective information including, at a minimum, data submitted\nthrough the uniform violent incident reporting system, also known as the\n\"school safety and educational climate report\", established pursuant to section\n2802\nof the\n\nEducation Law and pursuant to section\n100.2\n(gg)\nof this\n\nSubchapter, over a period of two years. (b) Victims of violent criminal offenses. Each local educational agency that is required to provide unsafe school choice\nshall establish procedures for determinations by the superintendent of schools\nor other chief school officer of whether a student is the victim of a violent\ncriminal offense that occurred on school grounds of the school that the student\nattends. Such superintendent of schools or other chief school officer shall, prior to making any such determination, consult with any law enforcement agency\ninvestigating such alleged violent criminal offense and consider any reports or\nrecords provided by such agency. The trustees or board of education or other\ngoverning board of a local educational agency may provide, by local rule or\nby-law, for appeal of the determination of the superintendent of schools to\nsuch governing board. The determination of such chief school officer pursuant\nto this subdivision shall not have collateral estoppel effect in any student\ndisciplinary proceeding brought against the alleged victim or perpetrator of\nsuch violent criminal offense. For purposes of this subdivision, violent\ncriminal offense shall mean a crime that involved infliction of serious\nphysical injury upon another as defined in the penal law, a sex offense that\ninvolved forcible compulsion or any other offense defined in the penal law that\ninvolved the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon. (c) Transfer. Any student who transfers to a\nsafe public school pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be enrolled\nin the classes and other activities of the public school to which such student\ntransfers in the same manner as all other children at the public\nschool. (d) Notification. Each\nlocal educational agency that is required to provide school choice pursuant to\nthe provisions of this section and section\n2802\nof the\n\nEducation Law shall establish procedures for notification of parents of, or\npersons in parental relation to, students attending schools that have been\ndesignated as persistently dangerous and parents of, or persons in parental\nrelation to, students who are victims of violent criminal offenses of their\nright to transfer to a safe public school within the local educational agency\nand procedures for such transfer. Such notice shall be, to the extent\npracticable, provided in the dominant language or mode of communication used by\nthe parents or persons in parental relation to such students. Nothing in this\nsubdivision shall be construed to require such notification where there are no\nother public schools within the local educational agency at the same grade\nlevel or such transfer to a safe public school within the local educational\nagency is otherwise impossible or to require a local educational agency that\nhas only one public school within the local educational agency or only one\npublic school at each grade level to develop such procedures. (1)\n\nWhere the Commissioner has determined\nthat a school is a persistently dangerous public elementary or secondary\nschool, the local educational agency shall notify the parents of, or persons in\nparental relation to, all students attending such school of their right to\ntransfer to a safe public school within the local educational agency and the\nprocedures for such transfer. The local educational agency shall so notify the\nparents of, or persons in parental relation to, all such students no later than\n10 days after such local educational agency has been advised that the\n\nCommissioner has determined that a school is a persistently dangerous public\nelementary or secondary school. (2)\n\nWhere a student has been determined to be the victim of a violent criminal\noffense, as defined in subdivision (b) of this section, the local educational\nagency shall notify the parents of, or persons in parental relation to, such\nstudent of his or her right to transfer to a safe public school within the\nlocal educational agency and the procedures for such transfer. The local\neducational agency shall so notify the parents of, or persons in parental\nrelation to, such student within 24 hours of such\ndetermination. (e) Duration of unsafe school choice. (1)\n\nThe\ntransfer of a student to a safe public school from a school that has been\ndesignated by the Commissioner as a persistently dangerous public elementary or\nsecondary school pursuant to the provisions of this section may be either\ntemporary or permanent, as determined by the local educational agency, provided, however, that a temporary transfer shall remain in effect at least as\nlong as such student's transferring school continues to be identified as\npersistently dangerous, unless the parent or other person in parental\nrelationship to the student requests that the student transfer back to the\ntransferring school pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision. In\ndetermining whether a transfer will be temporary or permanent, a local\neducational agency shall evaluate the educational needs of the student and any\nother relevant factors affecting such student's ability to succeed if returned\nto the transferring school, and shall make the transfer permanent if such\nevaluation indicates that a permanent transfer would be in the best educational\ninterests of the student. For purposes of this subdivision, permanent transfer\nshall mean a transfer that ends when the student has completed the highest\ngrade level in the school such student has transferred to, or when the parent\nor other person in parental relationship to the student has requested that the\nstudent transfer back to the transferring school pursuant to paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision. (2)\n\nAny student\nwho has been the victim of a violent criminal offense that occurred on the\ngrounds of a public elementary or secondary school that the student attends and\nwho transfers to a safe public school pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection shall be afforded a permanent transfer. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of\nthis subdivision to the contrary, the parent or other person in parental\nrelationship to a student who transfers to a safe school pursuant to this\nsection may request that such student be transferred back to the transferring\nschool, provided that the local educational agency may require that any such\ntransfer back be made effective at the start of classes in the next school\nyear. (f) When the\n\nCommissioner has designated a school of a local educational agency as a\npersistently dangerous public elementary or secondary school, or when a student\nhas been the victim of a violent criminal offense that occurred on the grounds\nof a public elementary or secondary school that the student attends, it shall\nbe the responsibility of such local educational agency, based on objective\ncriteria, to designate a safe public school or schools within the local\neducational agency to which students may transfer. Nothing in this subdivision\nshall be construed to require a local educational agency to designate a safe\npublic school where there are no other public schools within the local\neducational agency at the same grade level or such transfer to a safe public\nschool within the local educational agency is otherwise impossible or to\nrequire a local educational agency that has only one public school within the\nlocal educational agency or only one public school at each grade level to make\nsuch a designation. (g) Transportation. The local educational agency shall provide transportation for\nany student permitted to transfer to the safe public school within the local\neducational agency it has designated pursuant to subdivision (f) of this\nsection, within the transportation limits established pursuant to section 3635\nand subdivision 4 of section\n4401\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (h) In the event\nthat a local educational agency fails to comply with the school choice\nprovisions of this section or section\n2802\nof the\n\nEducation Law, the parent or person in parental relation to a student attending\na school that has been designated as persistently dangerous and the parent, or\npersons in parental relation to a student who is the victim of a violent\ncriminal offense, may commence an appeal to the Commissioner pursuant to\nsection\n310\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (i) Removal of\npersistently dangerous public elementary or secondary school designation. In\nthe event that a local educational agency believes that a school has\ndemonstrated the progress necessary to have its designation as a persistently\ndangerous public elementary or secondary school removed for the next school\nyear, such local educational agency may petition the Commissioner to remove\nsuch designation by the date prescribed by the Commissioner. A school's designation as persistently dangerous shall not\nbe removed if, in the Commissioner's judgment, conditions that may contribute\nto a dangerous environment remain present at the school.
