Any written request for records shall be deemed to be a request for records\npursuant to the Freedom of Information Law, whether or not the Freedom of\n\nInformation Law is mentioned in the request. A request for records may be sent\nto the State Energy Planning Board records access officer. (b) A request for access to records must\nreasonably describe the records requested. Where possible, specific information\nregarding dates, title, file designations, and other information which may help\nidentify the records, should be supplied by the requester. Where the\ninformation supplied by the requester is not sufficient to permit\nidentification and location of the records by board staff without an\nunreasonable amount of effort, the requester will be contacted and asked to\nsupply the necessary information. Every reasonable effort shall be made by\nboard staff to assist in the identification and location of requested\nrecords. (c) The board shall\nrespond to a written request which reasonably describes the records sought\nwithin five business days of receipt of the request. When appropriate, the\nresponse shall include a statement that access to the records sought will be\ndetermined in accordance with section\n7842.6\nof this Part, \"Confidential\ninformation.\"\n(d) If the board does\nnot provide or deny access to the record sought within five business days of\nreceipt of a request, the records access officer shall furnish a written\nacknowledgment of receipt of the request and a statement of the approximate\ndate, which shall be reasonable under the circumstances of the request, when\nthe request will be granted or denied, including, where appropriate, a\nstatement that access to the record will be determined in accordance with\nsection\n7842.6\nof this Part. If the board\ndetermines to grant a request in whole or in part, and if circumstances prevent\ndisclosure to the person requesting the records within 20 business days from\nthe date of the acknowledgment of the receipt of the request, the records\naccess officer shall state, in writing, both the reason for the inability to\ngrant the request within 20 business days and a date certain within a\nreasonable period, depending on the circumstances, when the request will be\ngranted in whole or in part. Reasons for an inability to grant a request within\n20 days may include, but are not limited to, the following: (1)\nwhen it is necessary to search for and\ncollect the requested records from board members or other entities that are\nseparate from the board; or\n(2)\nthe\nrequest requires the search for, collection or examination of a voluminous\namount of records The response may set forth a request on the part of the board\nto confer with the requester to review the request to determine which records\nwill satisfy the objectives and needs of the requester. The board's failure to\nconform to these provisions shall constitute a denial of access to records\nsubject to administrative appeal pursuant to section\n7842.8\nof this Part. (e) The time limitations on a\nresponse to requests for records shall begin to run as of the time a request\nfor records is received by the records access officer and a date-stamp notation\nplaced directly on the request.
