  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-9.2 - Closure site investigation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nnature and extent of any past, current and potential releases or migration of\ncontaminants from the site must be defined to ensure that an adequate final\nclosure plan is developed. For existing sites where information is known\nthrough previous monitoring of the facility during its operating life, some or\nall of the requirements of this section may be waived upon approval of the\ndepartment. The minimum elements of a closure site investigation are as\nfollows: (1)\nA hydrogeologic investigation\nperformed in accordance with Section\n363-4.4\nof this Subpart that, at a\nminimum, must: (i) define the geologic and\nhydrogeologic conditions of the uppermost aquifer and, as required by the\ndepartment, any other units in the critical stratigraphic section that may be\nimpacted by the facility; (ii)\nestablish a long-term monitoring well network in the uppermost aquifer and\nother units determined necessary by the department, to monitor potential\nenvironmental impacts from the landfill and the effects of closure or\nremediation; and\n(iii)\nanalyze the\ninitial round of samples or existing sampling data for each monitoring well\npoint for baseline parameters. If contamination is detected, the department may\nrequire additional sampling and analysis as specified in section\n363-4.6\nof this Part. (2)\n\nAn explosive gas investigation\nperformed to determine whether the site meets the requirements of subdivision\n363-7.1\n(e) of this\n\nPart, which must: (i) include at least three\nrounds of subsurface explosive gas monitoring performed along the perimeter\noutside the waste mass but within the property boundary. Monitoring must be\nperformed at 100-foot maximum intervals where temporary sampling locations are\nused, or at 400-foot maximum intervals where permanent gas monitoring wells are\nconstructed. Initial monitoring must be performed when atmospheric pressure and\nwind velocity are low and when the ground surface has been wet or frozen for\nseveral days. Monitoring must be done below the wet or frozen zone if\npresent; (ii)\nidentify the presence\nand concentration of explosive gases at or near the facility, including at the\nproperty line, in all on-site structures, and in potentially impacted off-site\nstructures; (iii)\ndetermine the\nextent of actual or potential gas migration off-site; and\n(iv)\ndescribe the soil stratigraphy beneath\nand around the facility in terms of its potential to allow gas\nmigration. (3)\nA surface\nleachate investigation. This investigation must be performed when groundwater\nlevels are at seasonal high elevations or at other times as specified by the\ndepartment and must: (i) identify the\npresence of leachate seeps or other uncontrolled leachate at, or emanating\nfrom, the facility; (ii)\ndocument\nany instances where fugitive leachate from the facility is discharging into\nsurface waters; and\n(iii)\ncharacterize the chemical constituents of surface leachate for baseline\nparameters. (4)\nA vector\ninvestigation to identify the presence of any vectors at the facility. If a\nvector problem is identified an appropriate remediation plan must be\nimplemented prior to cessation of waste acceptance at the facility. (b) Upon completion of the closure\nsite investigation, the data must be compiled and presented in a closure site\ninvestigation report. The closure site investigation report must be completed\nand submitted to the department for approval. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
