(2)\n\nThe form of the notice\nwill be as specified by the department, but must contain the date, time and\nlocation of the hearing. (c) Hearing participation. The parties to a\nhearing shall be: (1)\nthe person requesting\nthe hearing pursuant to section\n481.9\n(e) of this\n\nPart; and\n(2)\ndepartment\nstaff. (d) Rights of\nparties. The rights of parties are: (1)\nA\nparty desiring to participate at the hearing may do so in person, or by\nattorney or by representative presenting written authorization to represent\nthat party. (2)\nA party has the\nright to present relevant written and oral argument on issues of law and fact, to present relevant evidence and to cross-examine witnesses of other\nparties. (3)\n\nAny party initiating\nmotions, requests, briefs or other written material in connection with the\nhearings must serve such material on the other party and the ALJ. (4)\nA party must be present on a timely basis\nto present evidence, cross-examine witnesses or receive notice of scheduling of\nsubsequent sessions. Failure to be present at a hearing session without\nnotifying the ALJ in advance, will be deemed a waiver of the right to be\nheard. (e) The ALJ shall\nhave power to: (1)\nrule upon all motions and\nrequests; (2)\nset the time and\nplace of the hearing and recesses and adjournments; (3)\nadminister oaths and\naffirmations; (4)\nissue\nsubpoenas; (5)\nsummon and examine\nwitnesses; (6)\nestablish rules for\nand direct disclosure at the request of any party or upon the ALJ's own motion\nconsistent with the general principles of article 31 of the Civil Practice Law\nand Rules (CPLR) as applied to administrative fact-finding proceedings, if, in\nthe discretion of the ALJ, such disclosure will aid in narrowing the issues and\nnot unduly delay the proceedings; (7)\nadmit or exclude evidence including the\nexclusion or protection of evidence on grounds of privilege or\nconfidentiality; (8)\npreclude\nirrelevant or unduly repetitious, tangential, speculative testimony or\nargument; and\n(9)\ntake any measures\nnecessary for maintaining order and the efficient conduct of the\nhearing. (f) Prehearing\nconference. (1)\nA prehearing conference will\nprecede the hearing. The functions of the conference are to narrow or resolve\nissues concerning the disputed fees and penalties raised by the parties and to\ndefine and limit the scope of issues remaining as subjects for the hearing\nsessions. The ALJ may direct disclosure between the parties and outline the\nconduct of the hearing. (2)\n\nFollowing the conference, the ALJ will determine and advise the parties of the\nissues to which testimony and other evidence in the adjudicatory session will\nbe limited. (3)\n\nThe ALJ will\nsummarize for the record the action taken at the conference and incorporate\ninto the record any admissions, stipulations or agreements which were made by\nthe parties. (4)\n\nIf, as a result of\nthe conference, the ALJ determines that there are no disputed issues of fact, but only issues involving the interpretation or application of either the\nregulations or article 72 of the ECL, the ALJ shall prepare a report\nsummarizing the material facts and disputed issues and refer the matter to the\ngeneral counsel for a declaratory ruling, in accordance with Part 619 of this\n\nTitle. A copy of this report will be served on the parties and the hearing will\nbe cancelled. The parties may file briefs with the general counsel on the\nissues set forth in the report. (g) Conduct of the hearing. (1)\n\nOrder of events. The ALJ will have\ndiscretion to adjust the order of events and establish procedures to promote\nthe conduct of a fair and efficient hearing. In general, the order of events at\na hearing shall be as follows: (i) Formal\nopening: the ALJ will convene the hearing by opening the record, identifying\nthe issues involved and making appropriate procedural announcements as\nnecessary. (ii)\n\nNoting appearances: the ALJ will call the name of the person who has requested the hearing and note\nthe appearance of counsel, if any. (iii)\n\nOpening statements: prior to the\ncommencement of the evidentiary hearing each party may offer a brief opening\nstatement of position on the issues in dispute. (iv)\n\nAdmission of evidence: the person\nrequesting the hearing will present its direct case first. The department will\nthen present its case. Evidence will be confined to that which is relevant to\nthe issues identified by the ALJ. (v) Closing statements and briefs: closing\nstatements of position will be taken in the same manner as opening statements. At the concluding session of the hearing the ALJ will determine whether to\nallow the submission of written post-hearing briefs and proposed findings of\nfact. The hearing record will be officially closed upon the receipt of\nadditional technical data or other material agreed at the hearing to be made\navailable after the hearing, or the submission of briefs and reply briefs, proposed findings of fact, memoranda, and exceptions, if any, by the various\nparties, whichever occurs later. The ALJ will notify the parties by regular\nmail upon official closing of the hearing record. (2)\n\nMotions and requests may be made at any\ntime during the course of a hearing and will be part of the record. (3)\n\nThe ALJ will make findings of fact and\nconclusions based on the record and will forward a hearing report to the\ncommissioner for final decision. Where the ALJ has permitted parties to submit\nproposed findings of fact, the hearing report shall include a ruling on each\nproposed finding. (4)\n\nExcept as\nspecified elsewhere in this Part, all papers connected with a hearing may be\nserved by first class mail. (h) Subpoenas. (1)\n\nIn the case of a party not represented by\nan attorney: (i) a subpoena for a witness\nduring the course of a hearing shall be issued at the discretion of the ALJ; and\n(ii)\na subpoena involving\nspecified records (subpoena duces tecum) shall be issued by the ALJ only when\nthe party applying for such subpoena provides a written showing of necessity. Such subpoena shall designate as specifically as possible the books, papers or\nother materials to be produced by the party against whom the subpoena is\nserved. (2)\n\nService of a\nsubpoena will be the responsibility of the party requesting the\nsubpoena. (3)\n\nIf a party or witness\nfails to respond to a subpoena personally served, the default will be noted in\nthe hearing record. If the testimony involved is essential for the completion\nof a party's case, the hearing may be adjourned, until the party requesting or\nissuing the subpoena has had a reasonable opportunity to obtain compliance with\nthe subpoena in accordance with applicable law. (4)\n\nNothing in this Part limits the authority\nof an attorney of record for any party to issue subpoenas under the provisions\nof section 2302 of the CPLR. (i) Stipulations. (1)\n\nAt any time after publication of a notice\nof hearing, the ALJ may request that the parties attempt to stipulate to an\nagreement that will resolve specified issues and result in withdrawal of\nobjections, limiting the scope of subject matter or discontinuance of the\nhearing. (2)\n\nSuch stipulations will\nbe incorporated into the record of the hearing or agreed to in writing by the\ninvolved parties and filed with the ALJ. (3)\n\nSuch stipulations do not alter the\nresponsibility of the commissioner to make a determination consistent with all\napplicable laws. (j) Record of the hearing. (1)\n\nExcept as provided\nfor in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, all evidentiary proceedings at the\nhearing will be electronically recorded. (2)\n\nAny party, with the approval of the ALJ, may arrange for a certified reporter to produce a stenographic transcript of\nthe hearing. When a stenographic transcript is made, an original transcript\nmust be delivered to the ALJ at the expense of the party ordering the\ntranscript. (3)\n\nThe ALJ will file\nwith the commissioner a report and a complete record of the hearing which will\ninclude: (i) the statement of issues, request\nfor hearing, all notices (including a notice of hearing) and motions; (ii)\nthe electronic record of the hearing, the exhibits entered into evidence and any written transcript, if one was\nmade; (iii)\nany admissions, agreements or stipulations; (iv)\na\nstatement of matters officially noticed; (v) offers of proof, objections and rulings; and\n(vi)\nproposed findings, if\nany. (k) Evidence and burden of proof. (1)\n\nAll\nevidence submitted must be relevant. However, other legal rules of evidence\nobserved in courts need not be strictly applied. Hearsay evidence may be\nadmitted if a reasonable degree of reliability is shown. (2)\n\nEvidence otherwise relevant may be\nexcluded if its value as proof is substantially outweighed by a potential for\nunfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, undue delay, waste of time or\nneedless presentation of repetitious or duplicate evidence. (3)\n\nWhere part of a document is offered as\nevidence by one party, any party may offer the entire document as\nevidence. (4)\n\nEach witness must be\nsworn or make an affirmation before testifying. Opening, closing and other\nunsworn statements are not evidence they will be considered as arguments\nbearing on evidence. (5)\n\nThe person\nhaving to pay an annual program fee or penalty has the burden of proving, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that it is entitled to the relief\nrequested. (6)\n\nThe burden of proof\nto sustain a motion will be on the party making the motion. (7)\n\nAll decisions, determinations or orders\nmust be made upon consideration of the entire record. (l) Official notice. (1)\n\nThe ALJ or the commissioner may take\nofficial notice of a fact not subject to reasonable dispute if it is either\ngenerally known or can be accurately and readily verified in a generally\naccepted reference prior to or following the close of the hearing\nrecord. (2)\n\nIf the ALJ or the\ncommissioner intends to take official notice of a material fact which does not\nappear in the hearing record and of which judicial notice could not be taken, every party must be given notice and an opportunity to dispute the fact and its\nmateriality. (m) Communication with the ALJ or commissioner in the absence of other parties (ex\nparte rule). (1)\n\nNo party will directly or\nthrough a representative communicate with the ALJ or the commissioner in\nconnection with any issue without providing notice and an opportunity for all\nparties to participate. (2)\n\nThe ALJ\nor the commissioner must not directly or through a representative communicate\nwith any party in connection with any issue without providing notice and an\nopportunity for all parties to participate. However, any party may ask for a\nclarification of procedures from the general counsel's office. The ALJ or\ncommissioner may request aid and advice from any member of the department other\nthan the staff acting as parties to the case. (n) Final decision. (1)\n\nThe commissioner's decision will be made\nwithin 30 business days after the official closing of the hearing record. It\nwill be sent to the person requesting the hearing and the attorney of record, if any, by certified mail. A copy of the decision will also be forwarded to the\ndepartment staff. (2)\n\nThe\ncommissioner's decision must be made upon consideration of the report and\ncomplete record, supported by substantial evidence and will be in writing. It\nwill state the reasons for the action taken. (o) Special provisions. (1)\n\nAt any time prior to issuing the final\ndecision on the disputed fees or penalty, the commissioner or the ALJ may\ndirect that the hearing record be reopened. This may be done to secure\nadditional information or data or to consider significant new\nevidence. (2)\n\nTape recording or\ntelevising of a hearing for rebroadcast is prohibited by section\n52\nof the Civil\n\nRights Law. (p) Recusal. A party may file a written motion and supporting affidavits, with the ALJ, requesting the ALJ be recused. The ALJ's denial of the motion may be appealed\nto the commissioner within five days of the ALJ's ruling. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
