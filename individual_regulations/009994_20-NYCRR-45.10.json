  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 45.10 - Profits from the sale of securities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The law provides that there shall be\nincluded in gross income \"profits from the sale of securities\". Securities\ninclude generally stocks, bonds, rights to stock, etc. (b) The essential nature of the transaction\ndetermines whether there is one or more sales involved. For example, a utility\nduring the reporting period sells stock in two different corporations realizing\na gain in one case and a loss in the other. The transaction is considered as\ntwo sales and the profit is required to be included in gross income without any\ndeduction on account of the loss sustained. If, however, a utility carries a\nblock of 10,000 shares of the same securities of a corporation in its portfolio\nand orders its broker to sell the entire block, the fact that the broker\nexecutes the order by disposing of the block in several lots does not change\nthe essential nature of the transaction and make it more than one sale. In\ndetermining the profit from this transaction, the net amount is required to be\nincluded in gross income so that if, during the reporting period, some portion\nof the above mentioned securities are sold at a gain and some at a loss, only\nthe net profit is taxable. This transaction is considered as one sale for\npurposes of this tax. Question 43:A utility sells 1,000 shares of the stock of A\ncorporation during the month of November, 1950, and realizes a profit of\n$5,000. During the same month, it sells 500 shares of the stock of B\ncorporation and sustains a loss of $1,500. What amount is includible in gross\nincome? Answer: $5,000. Question 44:A utility sells 100 United States Government\nbonds and 10 bonds of the State of New York realizing a profit on each sale. Must the profits on such sales be included in gross income? Answer: Yes, profits on the sale of tax exempt securities are taxable. Question 45:Is profit realized by a utility on the sale of\nreacquired stock, or of securities of an affiliated company required to be\nincluded in its gross income? Answer: Yes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n45.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
