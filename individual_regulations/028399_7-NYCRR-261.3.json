At such meetings, conducted in accordance with subdivision (a)\nof this section, any inmate who has had a recommended loss of good behavior\nallowance from a superintendent's hearing shall appear before the committee. The committee shall consider whether, and set forth its recommendation as to\nwhether, the inmate's subsequent behavior merits restoration of all or part of\nthe lost allowance and its reasons therefor. (c) The committee shall not recommend the\ngranting of the total allowance authorized by law or the withholding of any\npart of the allowance in accordance with any automatic rule, but shall appraise\nthe entire institutional experience of the inmate and make its own\ndetermination.

Such report shall set forth its recommendation for the time to\nbe allowed for the period under consideration and the reasons for the\nrecommendation.
