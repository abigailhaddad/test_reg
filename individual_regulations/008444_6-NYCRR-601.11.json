  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 601.11 - Action on permit applications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department may grant or deny a\npermit, or grant a permit with conditions. (b) All water withdrawal permits shall be\nvalid for a fixed term not to exceed 10 years. (c) In making its decision to grant or deny a\npermit or to grant a permit with conditions, the department shall determine\nwhether: (1)\nthe proposed water withdrawal\ntakes proper consideration of other sources of water supply that are or may\nbecome available; (2)\nthe quantity\nof supply will be adequate for the proposed use; (3)\nthe proposed project is just and\nequitable to all affected municipalities and their inhabitants with regard to\ntheir present and future needs for sources of potable water supply; (4)\nthe need for all or part of the proposed\nwater withdrawal cannot reasonably be avoided through the efficient use and\nconservation of existing water supplies; (5)\nthe proposed water withdrawal is limited\nto quantities that are considered reasonable for the purposes for which the\nwater use is proposed; (6)\nthe\nproposed water withdrawal will be implemented in a manner to ensure it will\nresult in no significant individual or cumulative adverse impacts on the\nquantity or quality of the water source and water dependent natural resources, including aquatic life; this determination may include an evaluation of whether\nall withdrawn water that is not lost to reasonable consumptive use will be\nreturned to its source New York major drainage basin; (7)\nthe proposed water withdrawal will be\nimplemented in a manner that incorporates environmentally sound and\neconomically feasible water conservation measures; and\n(8)\nthe proposed water withdrawal will be\nimplemented in a manner that is consistent with applicable municipal, State and\n\nFederal laws as well as regional interstate and international\nagreements. (d) When a\nproposed water withdrawal for a public water supply also constitutes a\ndiversion of water out of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin that is\nsubject to Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin water resources compact, as\nenacted in ECL article 21, title 10, the department will determine whether all\nwithdrawn water that is not lost to reasonable consumptive use will be returned\nto the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin. (e) The department may require the submission\nof such additional information as is necessary to determine compliance with\nthis Part after a permit application has been filed. If such an application is\nincomplete or otherwise deficient, the processing of the application shall not\nbe completed until such time as the applicant has supplied the missing\ninformation or otherwise corrected the deficiency. If the department determines\nthat site visits by representatives of the department would be useful in\nevaluating the application, such site visits shall be considered a necessary\npart of the application. (f) Article 70 of the ECL and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder\nshall govern permit applications, renewals, modifications, suspensions and\nrevocations under this Part. (g) The department, in its discretion, may impose special conditions on public\nwater supply systems located in or adjacent to, or serving an agricultural\ndistrict established pursuant to article 25-AA of the Agriculture and Markets\n\nLaw. (h) When the water withdrawal\nsystem listed in an application is associated with a project, facility, activity or use that is subject to a SPDES permit or another department permit, the department will review the permit application in coordination with the\nSPDES or other permit program.
