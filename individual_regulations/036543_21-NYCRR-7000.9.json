(b) As alternatives to the\nforegoing, the institution requesting designation by the trustees of an account\nas eligible to accept the deposit of IOLA funds may offer: (1)\nthe greater of 60 percent of the Federal\n\nFunds Target Rate or one percent, paid on an interest-bearing checking account; or\n(2)\na yield specified by the\nIOLA fund, if it so chooses, which is agreed to by the financial institution\nand would be in effect for a period to be mutually agreed upon. (c) The following additional\nprovisions are applicable. As indicated by their terms, some apply only to one\nor some of the options set forth above. (1)\n\nThe Federal Funds Target Rate referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section\nshall be calculated as of the first day of each month. (2)\nA bank may elect to offer the highest\nrates that it pays on government or high-yield money market accounts on another\nqualifying IOLA checking account, instead of actually offering such\naccount. (3)\n\nInstitutions may elect\nto pay a higher interest or dividend rate than provided for in this\nsection. (4)\n\nAll participating\nfinancial institutions shall report, in the form and manner prescribed by the\nIOLA fund, on the best rate paid to their best customers for each of the types\nof accounts they offer within the definitions specified in paragraphs (a)(1)\nthrough (4) of this section. To enable attorneys and law firms to open and\nmaintain an IOLA account, an eligible banking institution shall, within 60 days\nof the effective date of these regulations and as requested thereafter, provide\nto the IOLA board information that demonstrates compliance with the provisions\nof this section. (5)\n\nWhere there is\nreasonable cause to believe a financial institution is willfully\nmisrepresenting its best rate information, the IOLA fund may condition\ncontinued approval status on a finding by the institution's auditor that its\ncertifications have been accurate. (d) The IOLA Board shall periodically monitor\nthe effectiveness of this standard. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
