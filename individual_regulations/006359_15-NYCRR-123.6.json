  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 123.6 - Guilty with an explanation plea\n\nState Regulations\nA guilty with an explanation plea may be made by appearing\nin person, on or before the date of appearance, at any hearing office and\ngiving to the clerk the summons, with the plea form on the back completed, the\ndriver's license and the conviction stub to the clerk, and then appearing\nbefore an administrative law judge. The motorist will then be called by the\nadministrative law judge and he may explain why a fine should be waived or\nreduced in amount. The explanation may not be that he did not commit the\nviolation. After receiving the explanation and accepting the plea, the\nadministrative law judge will review the motorist's record and determine the\nappropriate penalty. The fine schedule on the summons is not applicable. The\nadministrative law judge may impose a fine and/or suspend or revoke the\ndriver's license or registration or both as permitted by law. The disposition\nof the case will then be recorded as in the case of the guilty plea. Once the\nadministrative law judge announces the penalty, the plea may not be withdrawn. A motorist may be represented by an attorney or, in the administrative law\njudge's discretion, any other person designated as the motorist\nrepresentative. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n123.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
