  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 135.4 - Authorization for overtime work\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unscheduled overtime work must be authorized in advance by the appointing\nofficer or his designated representative before overtime may be credited. The\ndesignated representative must be an officer or supervisor ineligible to earn\novertime pay. Each instance of overtime work must be approved individually. \"Blanket approvals\" are not permitted. When unscheduled overtime is authorized\nby a designated representative, the appointing officer must be notified within\n24 hours. The appointing officer shall provide guidelines for future action by\neither agreeing with or questioning the authorization. (b) Notification of unscheduled overtime\nshall be forwarded to the Division of the Budget at the close of the bi-weekly\npayroll period in which the overtime is authorized. (c) Scheduled overtime work must have the\nprior approval of the Director of the Budget as provided under section\n135.7. (d) The appointing officer or his designated\nrepresentative will take all reasonable steps to provide for an equitable\ndistribution of scheduled overtime opportunities among qualified permanent\nofficers and employees of the appropriate work unit. (e) In the absence of a sufficient number of\nvolunteers, unscheduled overtime can be required of any officer and employee\nwho, in the judgment of the supervisor, is needed to do the work. (f) Overtime performed in a higher or lower\ntitle can be performed only on a voluntary basis. Extra service work can also\nbe performed only on a voluntary basis. (g) Eligible officers and employees shall be\neligible for overtime for actual travel and/or service performed while in\ntravel status, provided that: (1)\n\nThe trip is\nnot between the officer's or employee's residence and his official work station\nas defined by the appointing officer. (2)\n\nThe trip is for the purpose of conducting\n\nState business and is authorized in advance. (3)\n\nAuthorization is granted only when travel\nduring regular work hours is less economical or unduly delays the officer's or\nemployee's return to his official work station. (4)\n\nThe trip is not taken for the purpose of\nattending a professional conference or convention. Division of the Budget Interpretation\n\nAttendance at professional conferences and conventions\n\nThe following is our interpretation of the rules governing\novertime compensation insofar as they apply to persons eligible to earn\novertime who are attending professional conferences and conventions, at the\nfull or partial expense of the State. This interpretation is based on the\npremise that attendance at such sessions are of substantial benefit to the\nemployee and aid in his professional development. It is our opinion that the\ntime spent in attending such conferences and conventions, including travel time\nto and from them, during evenings, weekends and holidays cannot be considered\nas overtime. Employees eligible for overtime should be notified in advance that\nthey will not be eligible for overtime while in such attendance. It should be\nnoted, however, that wherever practicable travel incident to such attendance\nshould be so arranged as to occur during normal working hours. We believe this\nis a reasonable interpretation and is within the intent of the\nrules. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n135.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
