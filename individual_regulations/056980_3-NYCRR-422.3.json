(b) (1)\n\nFor\neach calendar year, the obligations imposed by RPA PL 1308 shall not apply\nduring that calendar year to a mortgagee that is able to establish all of the\nfollowing: (i) it is a State or federally\nchartered bank, savings bank, savings and loan association, or credit\nunion; (ii)\nit engages in mortgage\norigination and mortgage ownership during the calendar year; and\n(iii)\nit had less than three-tenths of one\npercent of the total loans in the state which the mortgagee either originated, owned, serviced, or maintained for the calendar year ending two years prior to\nthe current calendar year. (2)\n\nFor purposes of subparagraph (iii) of\nthis paragraph, whether a mortgagee had less than three-tenths of one percent\nof the total loans in the State during the calendar year ending two years prior\nto the current calendar year shall be calculated by dividing the number of\nmortgages issued in the State during that calendar year that the mortgagee\noriginated, owned, serviced and/or maintained by the total number of\nresidential real property mortgages originated in the State during the calendar\nyear ending two years prior to the current calendar year. (3)\n\nThe \"total number of residential real\nproperty mortgages originated in the State during the calendar year ending two\nyears prior to the current calendar year\" shall be determined by the\nsuperintendent, based on available data, and shall be published by the\nsuperintendent by November 15th of each year. (c) (1)\n\nThe\nobligations imposed by RPA PL 1308 shall not apply to residential real property\nwhen the mortgage became delinquent before December 20, 2016, the effective\ndate of RPA PL 1308, if a mortgagee is able to establish all of the following: (i) it is a State or federally chartered\nbank, savings bank, savings and loan association, or credit union; (ii)\nit engages in mortgage origination and\nmortgage ownership during the calendar year; and\n(iii)\nit had between three-tenths of one\npercent and five tenths of one percent of the total loans in the state which\nthe mortgagee either originated, owned, serviced, or maintained for the\ncalendar year ending two years prior to the current calendar year.

(3)\n\nThe\n\"total number of residential real property mortgages originated in the State\nduring the calendar year ending two years prior to the current calendar year\"\nshall be determined by the superintendent, based on available data, and shall\nbe published by the superintendent by November 15th of each year. (d) If, after being subject to the\nobligations imposed by RPA PL 1308, a mortgagee becomes exempt pursuant to\nsubdivision (b) or (c) of this section, then the obligations imposed by 1308\nshall continue to apply to all residential real property that became vacant and\nabandoned before the mortgagee became exempt and for which the mortgagee\ncontinues to own the mortgage, and, if applicable, to residential real property\nthat becomes vacant and abandoned after the mortgagee ceases to be\nexempt. (e) The burden of proving\nan exemption pursuant to this subdivision is upon the mortgagee claiming it. In\norder to establish an exemption from the requirements of RPA PL 1308, a\nmortgagee must submit to the superintendent by February 28, 2017 for the 2017\ncalendar year and for each calendar year thereafter, by December 31st of the\nyear preceding the calendar year in which the exemption is being sought, on the\nform required by the superintendent, a statement providing the basis for which\nthe mortgagee satisfies all three requirements of the relevant subsection. The\nstatement shall also identify all real property that, by application of\nsubdivision (d) of this section, will remain subject to the requirements in RPA\nPL 1308.

(f) (1)\n\nSubject to paragraph (2) of this subdivision, for all mortgages that are 90\ndays or more delinquent on December 20, 2016, the initial inspection required\nby RPA PL 1308 (1) must be made on or before February 1, 2017. (2)\n\nFor any residential real property that\nsatisfies the definition of vacant and abandoned in RPA PL 1309 as of December\n20, 2016, the requirements in RPA PL 1308 (3) must be satisfied by February 1, 2017. (g) Pursuant to\nRPA PL 1308 (11), State or federally chartered banks, savings banks, savings\nand loan associations and credit unions that qualify for the exemption under\nsubdivision (b) of this section, and that are parties to the department's\n\nIndustry Best Practices: Inspecting, Securing and Maintaining Vacant and\n\nAbandoned Properties in New York, issued in May 2015, shall continue to be\nsubject to that agreement for so long as the terms and conditions of the\nagreement remain in effect.
