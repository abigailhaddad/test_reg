In addition, the corporation is not responsible for the\nprocessing time taken by the Department of Taxation and Finance, the Division\nof the Budget, the Office of the State Comptroller, or any other external\nentity that is required by statute or regulation to approve or process\ncorporation payments. (f) Reasons which justify the tolling of\npayment time for invoices.

In order to toll the prompt payment schedule without penalty, the\ncorporation has 15 days after receipt of an invoice to send a contractor\nnotification of defects or improprieties. Corporation notification shall be in\nthe form of a standardized letter. In the event that the corporation fails to\nact within 15 days, once the defect or impropriety is corrected, the number of\ndays allowed for payment is reduced by the number of days between the 15th day\nand the date of notification. In the event that the corporation's objections\nare proved unreasonable, the date by which contract payment shall be made is\ncalculated from the date of receipt of invoice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
