  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 561.7 - Extraordinary items\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt is the intent that net income shall reflect all items\nof profit and loss during the period with the sole exception of prior period\nadjustments as described in section\n561.8. Those items related to the\neffects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current\nperiod and which are not typical or customary business activities of the\ncompany shall be considered extraordinary items. Accordingly, they will be\nevents and transactions of significant effect which would not be expected to\nrecur frequently and which would not be considered as recurring factors in any\nevaluation of the ordinary operating processes of business. (In determining\nsignificance, items of a similar nature should be considered in the aggregate. Dissimilar items should be considered individually; however, if they are few in\nnumber, they may be considered in the aggregate.) To be considered as\nextraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than\napproximately five percent of income, computed before extraordinary items. Commission approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than five\npercent, as extraordinary. (See accounts 434, Extraordinary Income, and 435, Extraordinary Deductions.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n561.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
