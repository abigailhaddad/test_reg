  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 686.2 - Intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To set forth\nspecific minimum requirements with which a facility (see glossary, section\n686.99\nof this Part) in the\ncommunity residence (see glossary) class, certified by OPWDD, shall comply. This shall be in addition to any other regulation issued by the commissioner\n(see glossary) and designated therein as applicable to this facility\nclass. (b) To provide the basis to\na facility for the development and implementation of written agency/facility\n(see glossary, section\n686.99\nof this Part) specific\npolicies/procedures (see glossary) which shall reflect compliance with this\n\nPart. Such policies/procedures shall become part of the agency's/facility's\npolicy and/or procedure manual(s). Upon development, such policies/ procedures\nshall be implemented and the facility shall have the responsibility for\nensuring ongoing compliance with said policies/procedures. (c) OPWDD expects ongoing compliance with\nboth principles of compliance and standards of certification. Therefore, such\ncompliance shall be the responsibility of the agency/facility and shall be\nnecessary for continued participation as a certified facility. (d) The OPWDD certification process defined\nin subdivision\n686.2\n(e) of this\nsection is superseded by requirements in Part 619 of this Title, Certification\nof Facilities and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS), effective on the\neffective date of these regulations. (e) In reviewing the continued eligibility of\na facility in the community residence class for an operating certificate, OPWDD\nshall survey for compliance with all \"standards of certification\" (see\nglossary, section\n686.99\nof this Part) herein and\nany other regulatory requirements applicable to that class of operating\ncertificate. OPWDD may make inquiries into and evaluate evidence of\nnoncompliance with the \"principles of compliance\" (see glossary) applicable to\nthis class of operating certificate. (1)\n\nPrinciples of compliance set forth the basic conditions for the operation of\nthe facility. Principles of compliance identify those requirements in which the\n\nState has a substantive interest because they are the basic and necessary\nconditions of participation with which a facility is to comply. (i) Principles of compliance establish basic\nand necessary conditions with which a facility must be in compliance in order\nto receive and maintain certification. (ii)\n\nSuch principles shall focus on\nparticular service or administrative components of a facility and/or on an\nentire certification classification. The intent of such principles is to\nclearly indicate the scope and extent of the State's interest. (iii)\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, an\nagency/facility shall have the authority to demonstrate through policies, procedures, other documents, or any means, the methods and practices it will\nutilize to establish and ensure continued compliance with such\nprinciples. (iv)\n\nThese documents\nand/or means shall be made available to, or verified by, OPWDD to assess\ncompliance and to grant initial certification. (2)\nOPWDD reserves the right to monitor\ncompliance at any time pursuant to the responsibilities of the commissioner\nunder the Mental Hygiene Law. Facilities will not be routinely examined against\nprinciples of compliance at surveys for recertification. The process whereby\nprinciples of compliance shall be reviewed and/or enforced shall be contingent\nupon the following premises: (i) A mechanism\nfor informal reconsideration or review shall be established for resolution of\ndisputed issues relative to compliance. (ii)\n\nPrinciples of compliance and standards\nof certification are written to stand independently of one another; however, standards may reflect and/or explicate concepts or requirements set forth in\nprinciples. (iii)\n\nAt the time of\ninitial certification, a facility shall be examined against the concepts and\nrequirements set forth in the principles of compliance. (iv)\n\nAfter initial certification, OPWDD shall\npresume compliance with principles of compliance unless there is an indication\nof noncompliance brought to its attention. Except in the instance of those\nsituations which pose a threat to the health and safety of the individual, noncompliance shall require more than one violation of the principle, unless\nthe situation is pervasive, systemic or egregious. (v) Any person who has cause to question\nwhether a facility is operating in conformance with required regulations has a\nright to bring their concern to the attention of OPWDD. (vi)\n\nThe process whereby an allegation of\nnoncompliance with a principle of compliance will be handled shall take into\nconsideration the orderly collection of information, evaluation of the\ninformation, determination of an appropriate course of action, and the\nrecording of same. (vii)\n\nSurvey\nis a term that will be used only in relation to\nsurveyor activity directly linked to determining conformity with standards of\ncertification and other pertinent regulations. (viii)\n\nRoutine surveys for recertification\nshall be based solely on the requirements set forth in standards of\ncertification and any other pertinent regulations. (ix)\n\nThe fundamental focus of surveyors when\nonsite at a facility for recertification purposes shall be to determine\ncompliance with standards of certification. They are not charged with a primary\nresponsibility of looking for indications of noncompliance in relation to\nprinciples. (x) Surveyors visiting\na facility to determine compliance with standards of certification shall not\n\"cite\" the facility for noncompliance with a principle. Whenever possible, surveyors shall bring additional matters of concern to the attention of the\nfacility during the exit interview. (xi)\n\nThe review of and inquiry into concerns\nbrought to the attention of OPWDD shall be done by individuals with training to\nunderstand and apply principles of compliance from a broad base of\nexperience. (xii)\n\nAny reviews of\ninquiries shall provide for the use of experiential judgment on the part of the\nperson doing the review or inquiry. (xiii)\n\nAn inquiry into an indication of\nnoncompliance with principles of compliance shall not be viewed as or termed a\n\"survey.\"\n(xiv)\n\nAn inquiry into an\nindication of noncompliance shall be for the purpose of OPWDD ascertaining, through the collection of information, that a facility is not conforming to the\nprinciple(s) of compliance in question. It shall not be conceived as a process\nwhereby a facility is compelled to prove compliance; rather, one whereby OPWDD\nsubstantiates that there is a violation. (xv)\n\nWhen an inquiry results in the\nvalidation of an expressed concern, the facility shall be notified of the\nfinding by way of a preliminary report. At that time, the agency/facility shall\nbe given the opportunity to respond and, if considered necessary by the\nfacility, to access an informal reconsideration or review mechanism prior to\nthe issuance of a formal notification of violation of a principle(s) of\ncompliance and the request for a course of action to correct the\nviolation. (xvi)\nOPWDD shall\nprovide an equitable mechanism, whereby there shall be an informal\nreconsideration or review, whenever the facility is concerned with the\ndetermination of noncompliance or the adequacy of the agency's/facility's plan\nof corrective action. The goal of such mechanism shall be to facilitate, whenever possible, resolution of disputes. Such mechanisms shall not neutralize\nor obstruct OPWDD's ability to implement article 16 actions\n(\ni.e., suspension, revocation or limitation of an operating\ncertificate) at any time subsequent to identification of a\nviolation(s). (xvii)\n\nAppropriate\nB/DDSO's (see glossary, section\n686.99\nof this Part) shall be\nadvised of actions taken relative to noncompliance issues at facilities in\ntheir service areas. (3)\n\nStandards of certification\nare those criteria which OPWDD\nspecifies as necessary to be met in order for a facility to demonstrate that it\ncan and does provide the appropriate environment in which to adequately address\nthe matters of quality of care and welfare, individual rights, safety, and/or\nfiscal accountability. Surveys are conducted for the purpose of documenting\nconformity with standards of certification. Such conformance or an acceptable\nplan of correction is the basis for issuing an operating certificate and/or\nrenewing an operating certificate and constitutes one of the underlying\npremises justifying OPWDD's continued presumption of a facility's compliance\nwith the principles of certification. Standards of certification shall be\nsurveyed contingent upon the following premises: (i) By definition, all standards of\ncertification shall be met for a facility to be certified/recertified. Compliance with standards of certification shall include an acceptable plan of\ncorrective action. Except in the instance of those situations which pose a\nthreat to the health and safety of the individual, noncompliance shall require\nmore than one violation of the standard, unless the situation is pervasive, systemic or egregious. (ii)\n\nIn\norder to obtain initial certification, facilities shall be reviewed and\nsurveyed against both principles of compliance and standards of certification\nto assure that the facility, its program, and physical plant are in compliance\nwith the regulation. (iii)\n\nSurveys\nfor recertification will focus on determining compliance with the specified\nstandards of certification. (iv)\n\nAs\na survey for recertification focuses on standards of certification, the survey\ninstrument shall not instruct the surveyor to review any principles of\ncompliance. (v) The survey shall be\nconducted to ensure the facility's adequacy for\ncertification/recertification. (vi)\n\nSurveys, or portions thereof, shall be conducted when the residents are at\nhome. This will enable surveyors to rely more on observation and conversation\nand less on written documentation as means of verification of compliance with\nthe standards of certification. (vii)\n\nThe interpretation of a specific\nstandard of certification shall never be more restrictive than the written\nstandard. (viii)\n\nOnly paperwork\nexplicitly required by the standard of certification shall be included in the\nsurvey process. (ix)\n\nThe survey\nprocess shall be conducted with a maximum of efficiency and a minimum of\nintrusion. (x) Prior to issuance of\ninitial certification, the agency/facility's policy and procedure manual shall\nbe made available to the OPWDD Division of Quality of Assurance for its\ndiscretionary review of any topics related to the principles of compliance and\nstandards of certification, as required by applicable regulation. After initial\ncertification, the agency/facility's policy and/or procedure manual, and any\nsubsequent changes thereto, will be presumed to be compliant, unless a review\nfor cause determines that this is not so. (xi)\n\nIf the explicit condition(s) of the\nstandard of certification are met, the surveyor shall not further evaluate the\nagency's/facility's means of demonstrating compliance beyond the explicit\nconditions. (xii)\n\nIn State-owned or\n\nState-leased buildings, where physical plant deficiencies do not place\nindividuals in imminent danger of their health or safety, the statement of\ndeficiency shall note the noncompliance, but no plan of corrective action on\nthe part of a facility shall be required. (xiii)\n\nIn order to assure an adequate\nregulatory base to protect individual's rights, Parts 686 and 633 of this Title\nshall have the same effective date [January 31, 1988]. (xiv)\n\nThe process to be followed for\ncertification and recertification shall not require an agency/facility to\nimplement a plan of corrective action prior to its approval by OPWDD. (f) Any references\nherein, relating to service(s) planning, plan of services preparation, plan of\nservices review, plan of services documentation and plan of services/service\ndelivery monitoring, as of March 1, 1993 are superseded by the requirements\ngoverning the delivery of community residential habilitation services as set\nforth at Part 671 of this Title.
