  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-1.14 - Mechanical fuel and feed\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All boilers hereafter installed with gas, oil or mechanical firing, shall be\nprovided with an automatic low water fuel cutout of the manual reset type. All\nboilers installed after the effective date of this Part shall be provided with\ntwo automatic low water cutouts of the manual reset type except as follows: (1)\nboilers of 1,500 square feet or more of\nheating surface when there is an attendant present during boiler\noperation; (2)\nboilers of 100\nsquare feet or less of heating surface when the boiler is operated with no\nextraction of steam (closed system), provided that the boiler is on the same\nfloor or the floor immediately below the steam using equipment and provided\nthat the total length of connected steam piping does not exceed 50 feet; and\n(3)\nboilers of 20 square feet\nof heating surface or less (see section\n14-11.12\nof this Part). (b) Fuel cutouts, water feeding\nand regulating devices of the float type hereafter installed, shall comply with\nthe following requirements: (1)\n\nThe float\nchamber of a water feeder or regulator shall be set at a level that will start\nfeeding when the water level drops below the predetermined water level of that\nparticular boiler. (2)\nA fuel\ncutout switch, if installed, shall be so set or adjusted that it will shut off\nthe fuel supply before the water drops lower than one-quarter inch above the\nlowest visible level of the gage glass. The design and material of the float\nchamber shall comply with the requirements of section\n14-9.22\nof this Part and be\nproperly marked for pressure. Float chambers made of cast iron in accordance\nwith specifications SA-278 may be used for maximum boiler pressures not\nexceeding 250 pounds per square inch. Float chambers made of malleable iron in\naccordance with specifications SA-395 may be used for maximum boiler pressures\nnot exceeding 350 pounds per square inch. For higher pressures steel\nconstruction shall be used. (3)\n\nThe\nfloat shall have a displacement adequate to insure positive movement of the\nmechanism operating the feed valve and/or the cutout switch. It shall be tested\nagainst collapse at a pressure of at least twice the boiler pressure. Bearings, shafts, water valves and seats and other similar parts shall be of material\nthat is resistant to corrosion. (4)\n\nElectric switches shall be designed to prevent deterioration from atmospheric\nconditions and be approved by the Underwriters' Laboratories. Accessibility for\ninspection, cleaning and repairing shall be provided for all parts. (5)\n\nThe steam connection to a float chamber, including pipe, fittings, and valves, if any, shall comply with the\nrequirements of sections\n14-9.22\nand 14- 9.23 of this Part. There shall be no sag or offset in the piping which will permit the\naccumulation of water. (6)\n\nThe\nwater connection to a float chamber and drains from the float chamber, including pipe, fittings and valves, if any, shall comply with the requirements\nof sections\n14-9.22\nand\n14-9.23\nof this Part. (7)\n\nThe water connections shall be provided\nat each right angle turn with a cross or a fitting with a back outlet to permit\ncleaning in both directions. The upper edge of the water connection at the\nboiler shall not be above the lowest visible water level in the gage glass. No\npart of this pipe connection shall be above point of connection at the float\nchamber. (8)\n\nThe minimum size of\npipes connecting the float chamber to a boiler shall be one inch for the\nconnection below the water line and three-quarters inch for the steam\nconnection. When shutoffs are used on the connection pipes, they shall be\neither outside-screw-and-yoke gate valves or stopcocks or valves with levers\npermanently fastened thereto and marked in line with their passage, or of such\nother through flow construction as to prevent stoppage by deposits of sediment\nand to indicate by the position of the operating mechanism whether they are in\nopen or closed position; and such valves or cocks shall be locked or sealed\nopen. Where stopcocks are used they shall be of a type with the plug held in\nplace by a guard or gland. Connecting the float chamber to gage glass\nconnections is not recommended unless the gage glass connections are at least\none inch pipe size below the water line and three-quarters inch for the steam. Exception:For boilers of less than 50 square feet of\nheating surface the minimum size pipe shall be three-quarters inch for the\nconnection below the water line and one-half inch for the steam\nconnection. (9)\n\nNo outlet\nconnection, except for damper regulation, drains, steam gages or such apparatus\nwhich does not permit the escape of an appreciable amount of steam or water\ntherefrom, shall be placed on the float chamber or pipes connecting the float\nchamber to a boiler. (10)\n\nThe float\nchamber shall be fitted with a drain valve having a suitable connection to the\nashpit, or other safe point of waste, and if the water connection thereto has a\nrising bend or pocket which cannot be drained by means of the float chamber\ndrain, an additional drain shall be placed on this connection in order that it\nmay be blown off to clear any sediment from the pipe. The float chamber blowoff\npipe shall be at least three-quarters inch pipe size, except for boilers of 50\nsquare feet or less of heating surface, when it can be one-half inch. (11)\n\nFeed water regulator and low water\ncut-off shall be tested daily and maintained in good working\ncondition. (12)\n\nBoilers consisting\nof continuous piping affording no reservoir or water level practicable for the\noperation of a low water cutoff may be equipped with a flow valve or other\nsuitable control which has been tested and approved in accordance with a code\nor standard commonly applied in the industry, e.g., AGA or UL.
