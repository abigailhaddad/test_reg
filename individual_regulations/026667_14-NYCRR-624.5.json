  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 624.5 - Reporting, recording, and investigation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Policies and Procedures. (1)\n\nEvery agency must develop policies and\nprocedures that are in conformance with this Part to address: (i) reporting, recording, investigation, review, and monitoring of reportable incidents and notable\noccurrences; (ii)\nidentification of\nreporting responsibilities of employees, interns, volunteers, consultants, contractors, and family care providers; and\n(iii)\nproviding notice to all employees which\nstates that: (a) all reportable incidents, including reports of abuse and neglect, must be investigated; and\n(b) if an employee leaves employment prior to\nthe conclusion of a pending investigation, the investigation must continue\nuntil it is completed and (for reports of abuse and neglect) a finding is made\nof substantiated or unsubstantiated. (2)\n\nAgency policies and procedures, whether\nnewly developed or representing change from previously approved policies, must\nbe subject to approval by the agency's governing body. (3)\n\nNotification of policies and\nprocedures. (i) Upon commencement of\nservice provision, and annually thereafter, an agency must offer to make\navailable written information, developed by OPWDD in collaboration with the\n\nJustice Center, and a copy of the agency's policies and procedures, to persons\nreceiving services who have the capacity to understand the information and to\ntheir parents, guardians, correspondents (see glossary, section\n624.20\n) or advocates (see\nglossary, section\n624.20\n), unless a person is a\ncapable adult who objects to their notification. The agency must also offer to\nmake available a copy of OPWDD's Part 624 regulations. In order to satisfy this\nrequirement the agency shall: (a) provide\ninstructions on how to access such information in electronic format\nand; (b) upon written request, provide paper copies of such information. (ii)\n\nUpon employment or initial volunteer, contract, or sponsorship arrangements, and annually thereafter, an agency must\nmake the agency's policies and procedures on incident management known to\nagency employees, interns, volunteers, consultants, contractors, and family\ncare providers. For parties who are required to be trained, this information\nmust be provided in conjunction with training conducted in accordance with\nsection\n633.8\nof this Title. (iii)\n\nIn accordance with section\n633.7\nof this Title, custodians\nwith regular and direct contact in facilities and programs operated or\ncertified by OPWDD must be provided with the code of conduct adopted by the\n\nJustice Center. (b) General reporting\nrequirements. (1)\n\nAll agency\nemployees, interns, volunteers, consultants, contractors, and family care\nproviders are required to report any event or situation that meets the criteria\nof a reportable incident or notable occurrence as defined in this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nInternal agency\nreporting. (i) All minor notable occurrences, as defined in section\n624.4\nof this Part, must be\nreported to the agency's chief executive officer (or designee) within 48 hours\nupon occurrence or discovery. (ii)\n\nAll reportable incidents, as defined in section\n624.3\nof this Part, and serious\nnotable occurrences, as defined in section\n624.4\nof this Part, must be\nreported to the agency's chief executive officer (or designee) immediately upon\noccurrence or discovery. (c) Immediate reporting to OPWDD. (1)\n\nAll reportable incidents and serious\nnotable occurrences must be reported immediately to OPWDD in the manner\nspecified by OPWDD. (2)\n\nImmediate\nentry of initial information into the OPWDD Incident Report and Management\n\nApplication (IRMA) does not satisfy the reporting requirement in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision. (3)\n\nImmediate\nreporting of reportable incidents to the VPCR (where applicable) does not\nsatisfy the requirement to immediately notify OPWDD of these incidents in\naccordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (d) Reporting of reportable incidents to the\n\nVulnerable Persons' Central Register (VPCR). (1)\n\nFacilities and programs that are operated\nor certified by OPWDD must report all reportable incidents to the VPCR. (Non-certified programs that are not State operated, and programs certified\nunder section\n16.03\n(a)(4)\nor\n16.03\n(a)(5)\nof the Mental Hygiene Law that are not\n\nState operated, are not required to report to the VPCR). (2)\n\nAll custodians (see glossary, section\n624.20\nof this Part) in facilities\nor programs operated or certified by OPWDD are \"mandated reporters\" and are\nrequired to report reportable incidents to the VPCR unless: (i) he or she knows that the report has\nalready been made by another mandated reporter; and\n(ii)\nthat he or she has been named in that\nreport as a person with knowledge of the incident. (3)\n\nAll custodians in facilities or programs\noperated or certified by OPWDD must submit reports of reportable incidents to\nthe VPCR immediately upon discovery of the reportable incident. (i) For purposes of this Part, \"discovery\"\noccurs when the mandated reporter witnesses a suspected reportable incident or\nwhen another party, including an individual receiving services, comes before\nthe mandated reporter in the mandated reporter's professional or official\ncapacity and provides the mandated reporter with reasonable cause to suspect\nthat the individual has been subjected to a reportable incident. (ii)\n\nReports must be submitted by a\nstatewide, toll-free telephone number (a ''hotline'') or by electronic\ntransmission, in a manner and on forms prescribed by the Justice\n\nCenter. (iii)\n\nMandated reporters\nshall have the rights and responsibilities established by section\n491\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law. (4)\n\nProviders shall establish written protocols to ensure reports involving\nmultiple mandated reporters are properly made and documented. (e) Reporting\ndeaths. (1)\n\nIn accordance with New\n\nYork State Law and guidance issued by the Justice Center, the death of any\nindividual who had received services operated or certified by OPWDD, within\nthirty days preceding his or her death, must be reported to the Justice Center. Specifics of the reporting requirement are as follows: (i) The initial report must be submitted by\nthe agency's chief executive officer or designee to the Justice Center death\nreporting line, in a manner specified by the Justice Center. (ii)\n\nThe death must be reported immediately\nupon discovery and in no case more than twenty-four hours after\ndiscovery. (iii)\n\nSubsequent\ninformation must be submitted to the Justice Center, by submission of the\n\nReport of Death\nin IRMA within five working days of discovery\nof the death. (iv)\n\nThe results of\nan autopsy, if performed and if available to the agency, must be submitted to\nthe Justice Center and OPWDD, in a manner specified by the Justice Center, within sixty working days of discovery of the death. (The Justice Center may\nextend the timeframe for good cause.)\n(2)\n\nAll deaths that are reported to the\n\nJustice Center must also be reported to OPWDD. (i) A death that occurred under the auspices\nof an agency (see paragraph (4) of this subdivision) must be reported as a\nserious notable occurrence in accordance with this Part (see also paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision). (ii)\nA death\nthat did not occur under the auspices of an agency (e.g., the death of a person\nwho received certified day habilitation services, but died at his or her\nprivate home of causes not associated with the day services) must be reported\nin accordance with Part 625 of this Title. (3)\n\nThe death of any individual who had\nreceived services certified, operated, or funded by OPWDD, and the death\noccurred under the auspices of the agency (see paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision), must be classified as a serious notable occurrence, and reported\nand managed as such, in accordance with the requirements of this\n\nPart. (4)\nA death is considered to\nhave occurred under the auspices of an agency if: (i) the individual was living in a\nresidential facility operated or certified by OPWDD, including a family care\nhome (but excluding free standing respite facilities), at the time of his or\nher death, or if the death occurred up to thirty days after the individual was\ndischarged from the residential facility (unless the person was admitted to a\ndifferent residential facility in the OPWDD system in the meantime); (ii)\nthe individual's death occurred during a\nstay at an OPWDD certified or operated free standing respite facility or was\ncaused by a reportable incident or notable occurrence, defined in sections\n624.3 and\n624.4\nof this Part, that occurred\nat the facility within thirty days of discovery of the death; or\n(iii)\nthe individual had received\nnon-residential services operated, certified, or funded by OPWDD, and\n(a) the death occurred while the individual\nwas receiving services; or\n(b) the\ndeath was caused by a reportable incident or notable occurrence, defined in\nsections 624.3 and\n624.4\nof this Part, that occurred\nduring the provision of services within thirty days of discovery of the\ndeath. (5)\n\nIf\nmore than one agency provided services to the individual, there must be one\nresponsible agency that is designated to report the death of the individual to\nthe Justice Center and/or OPWDD. The agency responsible for reporting in\naccordance with this paragraph must be the provider of the services to the\nindividual (or sponsoring agency) in the order stated: (i) OPWDD certified or operated residential\nfacility, including a family care home, but not a free-standing respite\nfacility; (ii)\nOPWDD certified or\noperated free standing respite facility, if the death occurred during the\nindividual's stay at the facility, or was caused by a reportable incident or\nnotable occurrence defined in sections 624.3 and\n624.4\nof this Part, that occurred\nduring a stay at the facility within thirty days of discovery of the\ndeath; (iii)\nOPWDD certified or\noperated day program (if the individual received services from more than one\ncertified day program, the responsible agency shall be the agency that provided\nthe greater duration of service on a regular basis); (iv)\nMSC or PCSS (only OPWDD operated\nservices report to the Justice Center); (v) HCBS Waiver services (only OPWDD operated\nservices report to the Justice Center); (vi)\n\nCare at Home Waiver services (only OPWDD\noperated services report to the Justice Center); (vii)\n\nArticle 16 clinic services; (viii)\nFSS or ISS (only OPWDD operated\nservices report to the Justice Center); (ix)\n\nAny other service operated by\nOPWDD. (x) Notwithstanding any\nother requirement in this paragraph, there may be circumstances in which the\ndeath of an individual who resided at a certified residential facility, was\nstaying at a certified free-standing respite facility, or attended a certified\nday program was caused by a reportable incident or notable occurrence that\noccurred under the auspices of another OPWDD certified, operated, or funded\nprogram or service within thirty days of discovery of the death; under these\ncircumstances the provider of services where the incident or occurrence\nhappened is responsible for reporting the death to the Justice Center (as\napplicable) and/or to OPWDD. (f) Reporting to OPWDD - Required\n\nReporting Formats. (1)\n\nReporting\nusing the OPWDD Incident Report and Management Application (IRMA; see glossary, section\n624.20\n). (i) Information must be entered into IRMA for\nthe following: (a) reportable incidents; and\n(b) serious notable\noccurrences. (ii)\n\nReporting initial information in IRMA. (a) Initial information is information about the incident or occurrence that is\nrequired to create a new incident report in IRMA and any other information\navailable at the time when information is first entered into IRMA. (b) When a report of a reportable incident or\na serious notable occurrence is made to the VPCR: (1)\ninitial information is automatically\nentered into IRMA; however, (2)\nagencies are required to review the information within 24 hours of occurrence\nor discovery of the incident or by close of the next working day, whichever is\nlater, and to report missing or discrepant information to OPWDD. (c) When a report of a reportable\nincident or a serious notable occurrence is not made to the VPCR, the agency\nmust enter initial information into IRMA within 24 hours of occurrence or\ndiscovery or by close of the next working day, whichever is later. (iii)\n\nReporting subsequent\ninformation in IRMA. (a) Subsequent\ninformation concerning the incident or occurrence that was not included in the\ninitial information entered in IRMA includes, but is not limited to, information about required notifications and updates to information related to\ndeaths (e.g., autopsy reports). (b) Subsequent information must be entered by the close of the fifth working day\nafter the action is taken or the information becomes available, except as\nfollows: (1)\n\nInformation about immediate\nprotections must be entered into IRMA within 24 hours after the action is taken\nor by the close of the next working day, whichever is later. (2)\nA report of death must be entered in IRMA\nwithin five working days of the discovery of the death. (3)\n\nIf another provision of this Part\nidentifies a different timeframe for the entry of specific information, agencies must comply with that timeframe requirement instead. Specific\ntimeframes are identified in provisions concerning: (i) reporting updates (see subdivision (m) of\nthis section); (ii)\nnotification of\nlaw enforcement officials (see section\n624.6\n); and\n(iii)\nminutes of incident review committee\n(IRC) meetings (see section\n624.7\n). (4)\n\nAgencies are not required to enter\ninformation about investigatory activities into IRMA until the investigative\nreport is completed. (c) For reports of abuse and neglect in facilities and programs that are certified\nor operated by OPWDD, subsequent information must include findings and\nrecommendations made by the Justice Center. (d) Agencies are required to comply with all\nrequests by OPWDD for the entry of specific subsequent information. (2)\n\nInitial\nincident/occurrence report. (i) Minor notable\noccurrences. Agencies may enter information about minor notable occurrences\ninto IRMA in lieu of completing a written initial incident/occurrence report. Within 48 hours of occurrence or discovery or by close of the next working day, whichever is later, the agency shall either: (a) complete a written initial\nincident/occurrence report in the form and format specified by OPWDD; or\n(b) enter initial information\ninto IRMA. (ii)\n\nTo\ncomply with any requirement that the agency send or disclose a copy of the\ninitial incident/occurrence report (e.g. in section\n624.6\nof this Part), the agency\nmust send or disclose either: (a) a copy of\nthe written initial incident/occurrence report completed by the agency pursuant\nto this paragraph (if one was completed; with redaction if required); or\n(b) an initial\nincident/occurrence report printed from IRMA (with redaction if\nrequired). (g) Immediate protections. (1)\nA person's safety must always be the\nprimary concern of the chief executive officer (or designee). He or she must\ntake necessary and reasonable steps to ensure that a person receiving services\nwho has been harmed receives any necessary treatment or care and, to the extent\npossible, take reasonable and prudent measures to immediately protect\nindividuals receiving services from harm and abuse. (2)\n\nWhen appropriate, an employee, intern, volunteer, consultant, or contractor alleged to have abused or neglected a\nperson must be removed from direct contact with, or responsibility for, all\npersons receiving services from the agency. (3)\n\nWhen appropriate, an individual receiving\nservices must be removed from a facility when it is determined that there is a\nrisk to such individual if he or she continues to remain in the\nfacility. (4)\n\nIf a person is\nphysically injured, an appropriate medical examination of the injured person\nmust be obtained. The name of the examiner must be recorded and his or her\nwritten findings must be retained. (h) General investigation\nrequirements. (1)\n\nAny report of a\nreportable incident or notable occurrence (both serious and minor) must be\nthoroughly investigated by the chief executive officer or an investigator\ndesignated by the chief executive officer, unless OPWDD or the Justice Center\nadvises the chief executive officer that the incident or occurrence will be\ninvestigated by OPWDD or the Justice Center and specifically relieves the\nagency of the obligation to investigate (see subdivision (i) of this section). (2)\n\nInvestigations of all\nreportable incidents and notable occurrences must be initiated immediately, with further investigation undertaken commensurate with the seriousness and\ncircumstances of the situation. (i) The agency\nmust commence an investigation immediately even when it anticipates that the\n\nJustice Center or Central Office of OPWDD will assume responsibility for the\ninvestigation. (ii)\n\nWhen an agency\nanticipates that the Justice Center or Central Office of OPWDD will assume\nresponsibility for the investigation, the actions taken by the agency are\nrestricted to: (a) securing and/or\ndocumenting (e.g. photographing) the scene as appropriate; (b) collecting and securing physical\nevidence; (c) taking preliminary\nstatements from witnesses and involved parties to the extent necessary to\nensure immediate protective measures can be implemented; and\n(d) performing other actions as specified by\nthe Justice Center or OPWDD. (iii)\n\nIn the event that law enforcement\ndirects that the agency forgo any of the actions specified in subparagraph (i)\nof this paragraph, the agency must comply with such direction. (iv)\n\nThe agency is responsible for monitoring\nIRMA to ascertain whether the Justice Center, the Central Office of OPWDD, or\nthe agency is responsible for the investigation. (v) If the Justice Center or the Central\n\nOffice of OPWDD is responsible for the investigation, the agency must fully\ncooperate with the assigned investigator but must not conduct an independent\ninvestigation. (vi)\n\nNotwithstanding\nany other provision in this subdivision, Intermediate Care Facilities must take\nsteps as needed to comply with federal requirements for the completion of\ninvestigations within specified timeframes, including assuming the\nresponsibility for conducting the investigation if necessary. (3)\n\nWhen an agency becomes aware\nof additional information concerning an incident that may warrant its\nreclassification. (i) If the incident was\nclassified as a reportable incident by the VPCR, or the additional information\nmay warrant its classification as a reportable incident, a program certified or\noperated by OPWDD must report the additional information to the VPCR. At its\ndiscretion, the VPCR may reclassify the incident based on the additional\ninformation. (ii)\n\nIn other cases\n(e.g., incidents in non-certified programs that are not operated by OPWDD or in\nprograms certified under section\n16.03\n(a)(4)\nor\n16.03\n(a)(5)\nof the Mental Hygiene Law that are not\noperated by OPWDD), the agency will determine whether the incident is to be\nreclas-sified and must report any reclassification in IRMA. (This\nreclassification is subject to review by OPWDD.)\n(iii)\n\nIn the event that the incident is\nreclassified, the agency must make all additional reports and notifications\nrequired by the reclassification. (4)\n\nWhen an agency is responsible for the\ninvestigation, the investigation must be documented. Such documentation must\ninclude an investigative report. (i) For all\nreportable incidents and notable occurrences, investigative reports must be in\nthe form and format specified by OPWDD. (ii)\n\nFor reportable incidents and serious\nnotable occurrences, the full text of the investigative report must be\nentered/uploaded into IRMA pursuant to subparagraph 624.5(f)(1)(iii). (Note: In\nthe event that the Central Office of OPWDD conducts an investigation of an\nincident or notable occurrence, the Central Office of OPWDD will make the\ninvestigative report available through IRMA.)\n(5)\n\nThe investigation must continue through\ncompletion regardless of whether an employee or other custodian who is directly\ninvolved leaves employment (or contact with individuals receiving services)\nbefore the investigation is complete. (6)\n\nAn agency must maintain the\nconfidentiality of information regarding the identities of reporters, witnesses, and subjects of reportable incidents and notable occurrences, and\nlimit access to such information to parties who need to know, including, but\nnot limited to, personnel administrators and assigned investigators. (7)\n\nRestrictions on situations that may\ncompromise the independence of investigators. (i) Any party who has been assigned to\ninvestigate a reportable incident, or notable occurrence in which he or she\nrecognizes a potential conflict of interest in the assignment, initially or\nwhile the investigation is underway, must report this information to the\nagency. The agency must relieve the assigned investigator of the duty to\ninvestigate if it is determined that there is a conflict of interest in the\nassignment. (ii)\n\nNo one may conduct\nan investigation of any reportable incident or serious notable occurrence in\nwhich he or she was directly involved, in which his or her testimony is\nincorporated, or in which a spouse, domestic partner, or immediate family\nmember was directly involved. (iii)\n\nNo one may conduct an investigation in which his or her spouse, domestic\npartner, or immediate family member provides supervision to the program where\nthe incident took place or provides supervision to directly involved\nparties. (iv)\n\nMembers of an\nincident review committee (IRC) must not routinely be assigned the\nresponsibility of investigating incidents or occurrences. In the event that an\nIRC member conducts an investigation of an incident or occurrence, the agency\nmust comply with subparagraph 624.7(f)(7)(ii). (v) For reportable incidents and serious\nnotable occurrences: (a) The agency must\nassign an investigator whose work function is at arm's length from staff who\nare directly involved in the reportable incident or serious notable occurrence. The requirements identified in clauses (\nb\n) and\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph reflect the minimum expectation\nregarding independence concerning the investigator's work function. (b) No party in the direct line of\nsupervision of staff who are directly involved in the reportable incident or\nserious notable occurrence may conduct the investigation of such an incident or\noccurrence, except for the chief executive officer. (c) Although the chief executive officer is\nin the direct line of supervision of all staff, the chief executive officer\n(not a designee) may conduct the investigation of a reportable incident or\nserious notable occurrence unless he or she is the immediate supervisor of any\nstaff who are directly involved in the reportable incident or serious notable\noccurrence. (8)\n\nFor reports of abuse or neglect in\nfacilities and programs certified or operated by OPWDD, the agency conducting\nthe investigation must notify each subject of the report that an investigation\nis being conducted, unless notifying the subject of the report would impede the\ninvestigation. (i) Such notification must be\nmade in the manner specified by the Justice Center. (ii)\n\nSuch notification or the reason a\nnotification was not made must be reported to OPWDD in the manner specified by\nOPWDD. (9)\n\nFor reports\nof abuse or neglect in facilities and programs certified or operated by OPWDD, the agency conducting the investigation must submit a request for a check of\nthe Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment (SCR) concerning\neach subject of the report. (i) Such request\nmust be submitted to the Justice Center in the form and manner specified by the\n\nJustice Center as soon as the information required to make the request is known\nor discovered. (ii)\n\nAs a result of\nthe check, the agency may receive information that one or more indicated\nreports exist concerning the subject of the report. If this occurs, the agency\nmust take appropriate steps to gather information contained in the report as\nspecified by the Justice Center. (iii)\n\nInformation obtained pursuant to this\nparagraph must be included in the investigation records submitted to OPWDD in\naccordance with subdivision (p) of this section. (i) Review/investigation\nby OPWDD and the Justice Center. (1)\nOPWDD and the Justice Center have the right to investigate and/or review any\nreportable incident. OPWDD also has the right to investigate and/or review any\nnotable occurrence. All relevant records, reports, and/or minutes of meetings\nat which the incident or occurrence was discussed must be made available to\nreviewers or investigators. Persons receiving services, staff, and any other\nrelevant parties may be interviewed in pursuit of any such investigation or\nreview. (2)\n\nWhen an incident or\noccurrence is investigated or reviewed by OPWDD and OPWDD makes recommendations\nto the agency concerning any matter related to the incident or occurrence\n(except during survey activities), the agency must either: (i) implement each recommendation in a timely\nmanner and submit documentation of the implementation to OPWDD; or\n(ii)\nin the event that the agency does not\nimplement a particular recommendation, submit written justification to OPWDD, within a month after the recommendation is made, and identify the alternative\nmeans that will be undertaken to address the issue, or explain why no action is\nneeded. (3)\n\nIn the\nevent that OPWDD or the Justice Center conducts an investigation, the agency\nmay be responsible to conduct some investigatory activities. In these\ninstances, the agency must comply with pertinent requirements in subdivision\n(h) of this section. Note that when the Justice Center conducts the\ninvestigation, the Justice Center is not required to adhere to the requirements\nof such subdivision (h). (j) Findings of reports of abuse or\nneglect. (1)\n\nFor every report of\nabuse or neglect, a finding must be made. The agency is required to make the\nfinding or, in the event that the Central Office of OPWDD or the Justice Center\nconducted the investigation, the Central Office of OPWDD or the Justice Center\nwill make the finding. A finding must be based on a preponderance of the\nevidence and indicate whether: (i) the report\nof abuse or neglect is\nsubstantiated\nbecause it is determined\nthat the incident occurred and the subject of the report was responsible or, if\nno subject can be identified and an incident occurred, that the agency was\nresponsible; or\n(ii)\nthe report of\nabuse or neglect is\nunsubstantiated\nbecause it is determined\nnot to have occurred or the subject of the report was not responsible, or\nbecause it cannot be determined that the incident occurred or that the subject\nof the report was responsible. (2)\n\nConcurrent finding. In conjunction with\nthe possible findings identified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a\nconcurrent finding may be made that a systemic problem caused or contributed to\nthe occurrence of the incident. (3)\n\nJustice Center review of findings for reports of abuse or neglect in facilities\nand programs that are certified or operated by OPWDD. When the investigation is\nconducted by an agency or by OPWDD, findings made by the agency or OPWDD are\nnot considered final until they are reviewed by the Justice Center. The Justice\n\nCenter may amend findings made by an agency or OPWDD. Findings made by the\n\nJustice Center are considered final. (k) Plans for prevention and\nremediation for substantiated reports of abuse or neglect when the\ninvestigation is conducted by the agency or OPWDD. (1)\n\nWithin 10 days of the IRC review of a\ncompleted investigation, the agency must develop a plan of prevention and\nremediation to be taken to assure the continued health, safety, and welfare of\nindividuals receiving services and to provide for the prevention of future acts\nof abuse and neglect. (2)\n\nThe plan\nmust include written endorsement by the CEO or designee. (3)\n\nThe plan must identify projected\nimplementation dates and specify by title agency staff who are responsible for\nmonitoring the implementation of each remedial action identified and for\nassessing the efficacy of the remedial action. (4)\n\nSuch plan must be entered into IRMA by\nthe close of the fifth working day after the development of the plan (see\nsubparagraph 624.5(f)(1)(iii)). (5)\nOPWDD will inform the Justice Center about plans developed pursuant to this\nsubdivision. (l) Corrections in response to findings and recommendations made by the\n\nJustice Center. When the Justice Center makes findings concerning\nreports of abuse and neglect under its jurisdiction and issues a report and/or\nrecommendations to the agency regarding such matters, the agency must: (1)\nmake a written response that identifies\naction taken in response to each correction requested in the report and/or each\nrecommendation made by the Justice Center; and\n(2)\nsubmit the written response to OPWDD in\nthe manner specified by OPWDD, within sixty days after the agency receives a\nreport of findings and/or recommendations from the Justice Center. (m) Reporting\nupdates. (1)\n\nFor reportable incidents\nand serious notable occurrences, an agency must enter reporting updates into\nIRMA on at least a monthly basis, or more frequently as requested by OPWDD, until closure of the incident or occurrence, except as noted in paragraph (5)\nof this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe agency\nmust complete required fields in IRMA for the reporting update. Among other\nrequired information, the reporting update must include: (i) a brief review of additions to the\nsummary of evidence and specific investigatory actions taken since the last\nupdate was entered into IRMA, if any; and\n(ii)\nif there have been no additions to the\nsummary of evidence or investigatory actions taken since the last report, an\nexplanation of why no progress has been made. (3)\n\nIf the agency is not responsible for\nconducting the investigation, the agency must complete the required fields to\nthe extent possible given information provided to the agency. (4)\n\nIf the agency is responsible for\nconducting the investigation and if the investigation has not been completed\nwithin the timeframe specified in subdivision (n) of this section, the agency\nmust inform OPWDD of the reason for extending the timeframe of the\ninvestigation and continue to keep OPWDD informed on at least a monthly basis\nof the progress of the investigation and other actions taken. (5)\n\nFor reportable incidents of abuse and\nneglect in facilities and programs that are certified or operated by OPWDD, an\nagency may enter reporting updates into IRMA less frequently than on a monthly\nbasis, if closure of the incident is exclusively pending receipt of written\nnotice from the Justice Center in accordance with subdivision (o) of this\nsection, and: (i) an initial update is entered\ninto IRMA to document that closure of the incident is pending receipt of such\nwritten notice from the Justice Center; (ii)\nan update is entered into IRMA by the\nclose of the fifth working day after the agency receives the written notice; and\n(iii)\nno additional updates are\nrequested by OPWDD. (n) Timeframe for completion of the\ninvestigation. When the agency is responsible for the investigation of\nan incident or notable occurrence: (1)\n\nThe\ninvestigation must be completed no later than 30 days after the incident or\nnotable occurrence is reported to the Justice Center and/or OPWDD, or, in the\ncase of a minor notable occurrence, no later than 30 days after completion of\nthe written initial occurrence report or entry of initial information in IRMA. An investigation is considered complete upon completion of the investigative\nreport. (2)\n\nThe agency may extend\nthe timeframe for completion of a specific investigation beyond 30 days if\nthere is adequate justification to do so. The agency must document its\njustification for the extension. Circumstances that may justify an extension\ninclude (but are not limited to): (i) whether\na related investigation is being conducted by an outside entity (e.g., law\nenforcement) that has requested the agency to delay necessary investigatory\nactions; and\n(ii)\nwhether there are\ndelays in obtaining necessary evidence that are beyond the control of the\nagency (e.g., an essential witness is temporarily unavailable to be interviewed\nand/or provide a written statement). (o) Closure of an incident or\noccurrence. An incident or occurrence is considered closed: (1)\nfor reportable incidents of abuse and\nneglect in programs that are not certified or operated by OPWDD, or are\ncertified under section\n16.03\n(a)(4)\nor\n16.03\n(a)(5)\nof the Mental Hygiene Law and not\noperated by OPWDD, and for reportable significant incidents and notable\noccurrences in all facilities and programs certified, operated, or funded by\nOPWDD: (i) if the agency conducts the\ninvestigation, when the IRC has ascertained that no further investigation is\nnecessary; or\n(ii)\nif the\ninvestigation is conducted by the Central Office of OPWDD, when the Central\n\nOffice of OPWDD notifies the agency of the results of the investigation; or\n(2)\nfor reportable\nincidents of abuse and neglect in facilities and programs that are certified or\noperated by OPWDD: (i) if the agency conducts\nthe investigation, when the Justice Center provides written notice to the\nagency of the Justice Center's review of the investigation; or\n(ii)\nif the Central Office of OPWDD conducts\nthe investigation, when the Justice Center provides written notice to the\nagency of the Justice Center's review of the investigation; or\n(iii)\nif the Justice Center conducts the\ninvestigation, when the Justice Center provides written notice to the agency\nthat the investigation is completed. (p) Submission of investigative\nrecords. If an agency conducts the investigation of a report of abuse\nor neglect or the death of an individual that occurred under the auspices of an\nagency, the agency must submit the entirety of the investigative record to the\n\nJustice Center and/or OPWDD, within 50 days of the VPCR and/or OPWDD accepting\nsuch report, as follows: (1)\n\nFor reports of\nabuse or neglect that were reported to the Justice Center, the agency must\nenter the entirety of the investigative record in the Justice Center's Web\n\nSubmission of Investigation Report (WSIR) application; or\n(2)\n\nEffective January 1, 2016, for reports of\nabuse and neglect that are not required to be reported to the Justice Center\nand for the death of any individual that occurs under the auspices of an\nagency, the agency must enter/upload the entirety of the investigative record\nin IRMA. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the\ntimeframe specified in this subdivision, the agency may take additional time to\nsubmit the investigative record provided, however, that the reasons for any\ndelay must be for good cause and must be documented. The record must be\nsubmitted as soon thereafter as practicably possible. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding the requirements in\nparagraphs (1) - (3) of this subdivision, in the event that the Justice Center\nor OPWDD conducts the investigation instead of the agency, the agency is not\nrequired to submit the investigative record to the Justice Center and/or OPWDD. In the event that OPWDD conducts the investigation, OPWDD will submit the\ninvestigative record to the Justice Center. However, agencies must provide\ninformation as requested by the Justice Center and/or OPWDD that may be deemed\nnecessary to complete the record. (q) Cooperation with the Justice\n\nCenter. In the event that the Justice Center requests additional\ninformation from the agency or OPWDD, in accordance with law or regulation, the\nagency or OPWDD must provide such requested information in a timely manner. (r) Duty to report events\nor situations under the auspices of another agency. (1)\n\nIf a reportable incident or notable\noccurrence is alleged to have occurred while a person was under the auspices of\nanother agency (e.g., day habilitation staff allege that a situation occurred\nat a residence), the discovering agency must document the situation and must\nreport the situation to the agency under whose auspices the event or situation\noccurred. (2)\n\nNote that mandated\nreporters (e.g., custodians) are required to make reports to the VPCR pursuant\nto section\n491\nof the\nsocial services law. This means that mandated reporters at the discovering\nagency must report to the VPCR upon discovery of a reportable incident that\noccurred in another program or facility which is certified or operated by\nOWPDD. (3)\n\nIt is the responsibility\nof the agency under whose auspices the situation is alleged to have occurred to\nreport, investigate, review, correct, and monitor the situation. Note: Similarly, when a person receives two or more services\nfrom the same provider agency, and one program or service environment discovers\nan incident that is alleged to have occurred under the supervision of another\nprogram or service environment operated by the same agency, the discovering\nprogram/service environment must document the situation and report it to the\nprogram/service environment where the situation or event is alleged to have\noccurred. The program or service environment where the incident is alleged to\nhave occurred is responsible for reporting and managing the incident, in\naccordance with this Part and agency policy. (4)\n\nIf the agency suspecting or alleging the\nincident or occurrence is not satisfied that the situation will be or is being\ninvestigated or handled appropriately, it must bring the situation to the\nattention of OPWDD. (s) Records and statistics. (1)\n\nRecord retention. Agencies must retain records pertaining to incidents and\noccurrences as follows: (i) Records that must\nbe retained include but are not limited to evidence and materials obtained or\naccessed during the investigative process, copies of all documents generated in\naccordance with requirements of this Part, and documentation regarding\ncompliance with the requirements of this Part. (ii)\n\nRecords must be retained for a minimum\nperiod of seven years from the date that the incident or occurrence is closed\n(see subdivision (o) of this section). However, when there is a pending audit\nor litigation concerning an incident or occurrence, agencies must retain the\npertinent records during the pendency of the audit or litigation. (2)\n\nRecords, reports, and\ndocumentation must be retrievable by the person's name and filing number or\nidentification code assigned by the agency. For incidents and occurrences that\nare reported in IRMA, such information must be retrievable by the master\nincident number in IRMA. (3)\n\nWhen\nthere is an incident or occurrence reported involving more than one person\nreceiving services: (i) From a statistical\npoint of view, the situation is considered as one event and must be recorded as\nsuch. (ii)\n\nThe agency must\nestablish whatever procedures it deems necessary to ensure that overall\nstatistics reflect single events and that, when an event involves more than one\nperson, records are retrievable by event in addition to being retrievable by a\nperson's name. (t) Confidentiality of records. All records generated in accordance with the requirements of this Part\nmust be kept confidential and must not be disclosed except as otherwise\nauthorized by law or regulation. Records of reportable incidents that are\nreported to the Justice Center are to be kept confidential pursuant to section\n496\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law. (u) Retaliation. (1)\n\nAn agency\nmust not take any retaliatory action against an employee or agent who believes\nthat he or she has reasonable cause to suspect that a person receiving services\nhas been subjected to a reportable incident or notable occurrence, and the\nemployee or agent makes a report to the VPCR and/or OPWDD in accordance with\nthis section and/or if the employee or agent cooperates with the investigation\nof a report made to the VPCR or OPWDD. (2)\n\nEffective January 1, 2014, when an agency\nenters into a new contract or renews a contract for the provision of services\nthat are provided by one or more employees or agents who have regular and\nsubstantial physical contact with persons receiving services, the contract must\ninclude a provision concerning retaliation by the contractor. The provision\nmust require the contractor not to take any retaliatory action against an\nemployee or agent of the contractor when: (i) the employee or agent believes that he or she has reasonable cause to suspect a\nperson receiving services has been subjected to a reportable incident or\nnotable occurrence, and the employee or agent makes a report to the VPCR and/or\nOPWDD in accordance with this section; and/or\n(ii)\nif the employee or agent of the\ncontractor cooperates with the investigation of a report to the VPCR and/or\nOPWDD. (v) Notice of findings involving employees or agents of\ncontractors. When an agency receives a written notice of findings from\nthe Justice Center regarding a report of abuse or neglect, and the subject of\nsuch notice is an employee or agent of a contractor, the agency must notify\nOPWDD of these circumstances within two weeks of such notice in the manner\nspecified by OPWDD. (w) Dedicated Mailbox for Incident Notifications. Effective\n\nJanuary 1, 2016, every agency providing services that are operated, certified, or funded by OPWDD must establish a dedicated electronic mailbox to receive\nincident notifications in order to act on issues, including requests from\nOPWDD, in a timely manner.
