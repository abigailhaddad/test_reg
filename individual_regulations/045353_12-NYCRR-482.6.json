Tit. 12 § 482.6 - Determining the availability of funds and payment of additional benefits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) At the\nbeginning of each program year, to the extent funds are available, the\ncommissioner will establish the priority for the payment of committed funds as\nfollows: (1)\nthe accrued obligations from the\nprior program year for individuals who were previously approved for additional\nbenefits and who remain eligible to receive additional benefits; (2)\nthe amounts needed to pay prospective\nadditional benefits to otherwise eligible individuals who were previously not\npaid additional benefits because funds were not available; and\n(3)\nthe amounts needed to pay new claimants\nwho are otherwise eligible for additional benefits. (b) The commissioner will determine the\navailability of funds on an ongoing basis by subtracting actual expenditures\nand committed funds from the amount of money allocated by the Legislature to\npay additional benefits in the program year. (1)\n\nWhen the sum of actual expenditures and\ncommitted funds equal or exceed the amount of money allocated by the\n\nLegislature for any program year, new applications for the payment of\nadditional benefits will not be authorized. (2)\n\nAt the time that the commissioner\ndetermines that additional funds have become available, new applications for\npayment of additional benefits will be authorized and paid pursuant to\nsubdivision (c) of this section. (c) In the event an individual is not\napproved for additional benefits because funds are not available, the\nindividual will have priority to receive additional benefits prospectively\npursuant to subdivision (a) of this section if additional funds become\navailable and the individual is still attending the same approved career and\nrelated training. Such priority will be determined based on the date that the\nindividual was approved by the commissioner for such career and related\ntraining. Prospective benefit payments will commence as of the date that the\ncommissioner determines that funds are available and the individual is eligible\nto receive additional benefits. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
