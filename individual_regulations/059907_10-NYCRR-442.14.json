  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.14 - Fund accounting\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1340 ]\n(a) General. (1)\n\nMany hospitals receive, from donors and\nother third parties, income, gifts, bequests and grants that are restricted as\nto use. When funds with donor-imposed restrictions are received, they must be\nreported separately. This would not preclude the pooling of assets for\ninvestment purposes. (2)\n\nFor\nbalance sheet reporting, donor-restricted funds must be recorded separately in\nthe appropriate restricted fund classifications. For income statement purposes, expenses relating to donor-restricted activities must be recorded in the\n\nUnrestricted Fund, and the earned share relative to such current year\ndonor-restricted activities must be recorded as \"Other Operating Revenue\"\nunless otherwise restricted by covenant agreement. Hospitals receiving no\nrestricted income, gifts, bequests or grants need not use separate fund\naccounting. (3)\n\nRestricted funds\ngenerally fall into three categories: Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund, Specific Purpose Fund, and Endowment Fund. The accounts within each restricted\nfund are self-balancing, as each fund constitutes a separate subodinate\naccounting entity. The following sections outline the conditions and events\nwhich require separate accountability and the required accounting treatment for\ntransactions within the established funds. (b) Unrestricted Fund. [ 1341 ]\n(1)\n\nThe Unrestricted Fund is used to account for funds derived from the day-to-day\nactivities of the hospital and unrestricted contributions. Funds which\noriginate from unrestricted gifts or previously accumulated income may be\ndesignated by the governing board for special uses. If the governing board\ndesignates assets in this manner, it should be recognized that the board also\nhas the authority to rescind its action. For this reason, such funds must be\naccounted for in the Unrestricted Fund as \"board-designated assets\". All other\nfunds within the Unrestricted Fund must be accounted for as operating funds. A\nseparate structure of accounts in the Unrestricted Fund has been provided for\noperating funds and board-designated assets. (2)\n\nThe term\nrestricted\nshould not be used in connection with board or other internal hospital\nappropriations or designations of assets. (c) Plant Replacement and Expansion\n\nFund. [ 1342 ]\n(1)\n\nResources restricted by donors and other third parties for the acquisition or\nconstruction of plant assets or the reduction of related debt must be accounted\nfor in the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund. (2)\n\nWhen expenditures for plant assets are\nmade by the Unrestricted Fund for the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund, a\ntransfer must be made from the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund to match\nsuch expenditures if such funds are available. The entries to record such\nexpenditures and the required transfer in both funds are as follows: (i) Unrestricted Fund\n\nJune 30\n\nAccount\n\nDr. Cr. Construction in progress\n1260\n$1,000\n\nOther accounts payable\n2029\n$1,000\n\nDue from Plant Replacement and Expansion\n\nFund\n1073\n$1,000\n\nTransfer from restricted funds for capital\noutlay\n2294\n$1,000\n(ii) Plant Replacement and Expansion\n\nFund\n\nTransfer to Unrestricted Fund for capital\noutlay\n2695\n$1,000\n\nDue to Operating Fund\n2581\n$1,000\n\nTo record construction expenses incurred and\nrelated interfund transfer entries. (3)\n\nDue to/due from accounts are to be used\nas an interim measure and should be reduced within a reasonable period of time\nby a transfer of assets (generally cash or investments) between the respective\nfunds. (i) Plant Replacement and Expansion\n\nFund\n\nJuly 3\n\nAccount\n\nDr. Cr. Due to Operating Fund\n2851\n$1,000\n\nCash\n1510\n$1,000\n(ii) Unrestricted Fund\n\nCash\n1010\n$1,000\n\nDue from Plant Replacement and Expansion\n\nFund\n1073\n$1,000\n\nTo record transfer of cash from Plant\n\nReplacement and Expansion Fund to the Operating Fund. (iii) Unrestricted Fund\n\nJuly 5\n\nOther accounts payable\n2029\n$1,000\n\nCash\n1010\n$1,000\n\nTo record payment of the\nliability. (4)\n\nIf cash is disbursed for plant assets\ndirectly from the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund, the plant assets must\nnonetheless be recorded in the Unrestricted Fund, with the accompanying credit\nmade to Fund Balance. In the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund, fund balance\nwould be debited, and a cash account credited. No entries would be made to the\ninterfund payable or receivable accounts, nor would any cash be transferred\nbetween funds. (5)\n\nThe preferred\nmethod of accounting for the expenditure of restricted Plant Replacement and\n\nExpansion funds is specified above. However, because of restrictions placed on\nconstruction funds by certain funding authorities, such expenditures and\nrelated liabilities are required to be recorded in the Plant Replacement and\n\nExpansion Fund. If expenditures for plant assets are recorded in the Plant\n\nReplacement and Expansion Fund, the plant assets must be transferred to the\nappropriate asset account in the Unrestricted Fund, with the accompanying\ncredit made to the Unrestricted Fund balance. In the Plant Replacement and\n\nExpansion Fund, fund balance would be debited, and the temporary accounts(s)\ncredited. No entry would be made to the interfund payable or receivable\naccounts. (Accounts have not been provided in this manual for recording such\nexpenditures and related liabilities. Hospitals may establish such accounts as\nnecessary.)\n(6)\n\nIncome earned and\nany net realized gains on investments must be reflected as an addition to the\nfund balance if so specified by the donor. If available for general operating\npurposes, they must be included in nonoperating revenue in the Unrestricted\n\nFund. (d) Specified\n\nPurpose Fund. [ 1343 ]\n(1)\n\nFunds received which are restricted for a specific operating purpose must be\naccounted for in the Specific Purpose Fund. These resources must be recorded as\nother operating revenue in the period in which expenditures are made for the\npurpose specified by the donor. (2)\n\nIncome earned and any net realized gains on investments must be recorded as an\naddition to fund balance if required to conform to the donor's instructions or\nas nonoperating revenue of the Unrestricted Fund if such revenue is available\nfor general purposes. (e) Endowment Fund. [ 1344 ]\n(1)\n\nFunds classified as endowment include: (i) pure endowment (principal is to remain intact in perpetuity); (ii)\nterm endowments (principal is available\nfor use upon the passage of time or the occurrence of an event). (2)\n\nWhen term endowments become\navailable to the governing board for unrestricted purposes, they must be\nrecorded as nonoperating revenue; if these funds are restricted, they must be\ntransferred to the appropriate restricted fund. (3)\n\nIncome earned on endowment fund\ninvestments must be accounted for in accordance with donors' instructions if\nrestricted, or as nonoperating revenue in the Unrestricted Fund if not\nrestricted. (f) Interfund Transactions. [ 1345 ]\n(1)\n\nAs\nis shown in the Chart of Accounts, the only liability accounts included in the\nrestricted funds (\ni.e., all funds other than the Unrestricted\n\nFund) are liabilities to other funds (with the exception of the Endowment Fund, which allows for the inclusion of certain liabilities on Endowment Fund assets, and the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund for certain covenant agreements as\nexplained under number 1342). (2)\n\nThus, virtually all liabilities incurred by the hospital are to be recorded in\nthe Unrestricted Fund. When these liabilities apply to restricted fund\nactivities, a receivable from the applicable restricted fund must be recorded\nwithin the Unrestricted Fund. A payable to the Unrestricted Fund (or transfer\nof funds if paid immediately), as well as a reduction of the restricted fund\nbalance, is recorded within the applicable restricted fund. (3)\n\nExcept for expenses incurred in\nconformity with covenant agreements, all expenses relating to restricted fund\nactivities must be recorded in the Unrestricted Fund in the cost center\ncategory to which they apply. This is true whether the actual expenditures of\ncash are made from the Unrestricted Fund or a restricted fund. Separate cost\ncenters must be established within each of these categories to record\nrestricted activities for which separate accounting is required by the terms of\nthe grant or gift. Sufficient account numbers have been allowed so that\nspecific restricted fund activities may be segregated. Transfers from the\nrestricted funds to match these expenses must be made in one of the following\naccounts: (i) transfers from restricted funds\nfor Research Expenses (account 5020); (ii)\ntransfers from restricted funds for\n\nEducation Expenses (account 5280); or\n(iii)\ntransfers from restricted funds for\n\nOther Operating Expenses (account 5880). (4)\n\nExample. In the following example, assume that $200 of\nconsulting costs were incurred (this consulting was performed by a nonrelated\norganization) for restricted research activities, recorded as an expense and a\nliability in the Unrestricted Fund, and subsequently paid. (i) Unrestricted\n\nFund\n\nJune 1\n\nAccount\n\nDr. Cr. Research\n8010\n$200\n\nAccounts payable\n2020\n$200\n\nDue from Specific Purpose Fund\n1074\n$200\n\nTransfers from restricted funds for Research\n\nExpenses\n5020\n$200\n(ii) Specific Purpose Fund\n\nJune 1\n\nTransfers to Operating Fund for Operating\n\nPurposes\n2797\n$200\n\nDue to Operating Fund\n2781\n$200\n\nTo record the expense and related liability\nfor costs incurred in restricted research activities in the Operating Fund and\nrecord an interfund liability and reduction in fund balance in the Specific\n\nPurpose Fund. (iii) Unrestricted Fund\n\nJune 10\n\nCash\n1010\n$200\n\nDue from Specific Purpose Fund\n1074\n$200\n(iv) Specific Purpose Fund\n\nJune 10\n\nDue to Operating Fund\n2781\n$200\n\nCash\n1710\n$200\n\nTo record the transfer of cash to the\n\nOperating Fund. (v) Unrestricted Fund\n\nJune 15\n\nAccounts payable\n2020\n$200\n\nCash\n1010\n$200\n\nTo record the payment of the\nliability. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
