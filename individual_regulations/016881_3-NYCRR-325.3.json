  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 325.3 - Policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A debt will be\nconsidered fully secured for the purpose of this section if it is secured (1)\nby collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property, including securities, that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the\ndebt (including accrued interest) in full, or (2) by the guaranty of a\nfinancially responsible party. (b) Loans which reach nonaccrual status may not be restored to accruing status\nuntil all delinquent principal and/or interest has been brought current, or the\nloan becomes fully secured as to both principal and interest. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, a loan may be restored to accrual status in accordance with\napplicable regulatory accounting principles. (c) The date on which a loan reaches\nnonaccrual status is determined by the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan\nreaches nonaccrual status on a date which falls between the dates on which the\nbank or trust company closes its books, it remains on nonaccrual status until\nit meets the criteria for restoration to accruing status. (d) Consumer loans and loans secured by one-\nto four-family residential properties, on which principal or interest is due\nand unpaid for 90 days or more, are not required to be placed in nonaccrual\nstatus. Such loans should, however, be subject to other alternative methods of\nevaluation to assure that the institution's net income is not materially\noverstated. (e) The reversal of\npreviously accrued but uncollected interest applicable to any asset placed in\nnonaccrual status, and the treatment of any subsequent payments as either\nprincipal or interest, should be handled in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. Acceptable accounting treatment includes a reversal of\nall previously accrued but uncollected interest applicable to assets placed in\na nonaccrual status against appropriate income and balance sheet\naccounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n325.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
