  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4217.10 - Quinella\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The quinella is\na form of pari-mutuel wagering. Each bettor selects two horses to place first\nand second in the designated quinella race, the order of placing of the said\ntwo horses being immaterial. The quinella is not a parlay and this pool shall\nbe held entirely separate from all other pools, and is in no way a part of the\ndaily double, exacta, triple, superfecta, straight, place or show\npools. (b) [Reserved]\n(c) Races in which quinella pools are to be\nconducted shall be approved by the commission and shall be clearly designated\nin the racing program. (d) The\ndesign of quinella tickets shall be clearly and immediately distinguishable\nfrom other pari-mutuel tickets. (e) Scratch. If a horse is scratched or declared a nonstarter no further tickets\nmay be issued designating such horse and all tickets previously issued\ndesignating such horse shall be refunded and the money deducted from the gross\npool. (f) Failure to select a\nwinning combination. If no ticket is sold on a winning combination in a\nquinella pool, the net pool shall be apportioned among those holding tickets\ndesignating the horse placing first with any other horse and those holding\ntickets designating the horse placing second with any other horse, in the same\nmanner in which a place pool is calculated. (g) Dead heat. In case of a dead heat between\ntwo horses for the first place, that combination shall be the winner of the\nquinella pool. In cases of a dead heat for first place involving more than two\nhorses, the net pool shall be calculated and distributed to holders of tickets\ncombining any two dead-heated horses as in a win pool dead heat. (h) In case of a dead heat between two horses\nfor second place, the pool shall be figured as a \"place pool,\" the holders of\ntickets combining the winning horse and one of the two horses placing second\nparticipating in the payoff. (i) In\ncase of a dead heat for second place and no tickets are sold on one of the two\nwinning combinations, the entire net pool shall be calculated as a win pool and\ndistributed to those holding tickets on the other winning\ncombination. (j) If no tickets\ncombine the winning horse with either of the place horses in the dead heat the\npool shall be apportioned among those holding tickets designating the first\nplace horse and any other horse, and those holding tickets designating a second\nplace horse with any other horse, as in a place pool in which a dead heat for\nplace occurs. (k) If no ticket is\nsold that would require distribution of a quinella pool to a winner as defined\nin this section, the track shall make a complete and full refund of the\nquinella pool. (l) In the event\nfewer than four betting interests start, the quinella pool shall be declared\noff and the gross pool refunded. (m) This section shall be prominently\ndisplayed throughout the betting area of each track conducting the quinella and\nprinted copies of this section shall be distributed by the track to patrons\nupon request. (n) Winning\ncombination. The numbers of the first two horses as made official shall be the\nwinning combination regardless of their respective order of finish, except that\nwhere more than one of such horses is part of a coupled entry or field with\nanother of such horses, only the one best finisher of such horses shall be\ncounted in the winning combination for payoff, and the horse or horses not in\nsuch coupled entry or field finishing the same, or, if applicable, next\nfinishing, shall be the other part of the winning quinella combination. For\nexample, if two horses in a coupled entry (or field): (1)\nfinish first and second, or in a dead\nheat for first, the winning combination will be the number of such entry or\nfield and the number of the third finishing horse not part of such entry or\nfield; (2)\nfinish first and in a\ndead heat for second, the winning combination will be the number of such entry\nor field and the number of the other horse dead-heated for second who is not\npart of such coupled entry or field; (3)\nfinish in a three-horse dead heat for win\nwith another horse not part of such entry or field, the winning combination\nwill be the number of such entry and the number of the horse not part of such\nentry.
