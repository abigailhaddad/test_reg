  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 450.1 - Applicability and relationship to reimbursement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Article is applicable to all\nresidential health care facilities except those that are hospital-based, unless\nsaid residential health care facility was organized under article 28-A of the\n\nPublic Health Law, in which case this Article applies regardless of whether or\nnot such facility is hospital-based. (b) This Article has been designed so that a\nuniform report for financial disclosure could be developed. This Article has\nnot been designed to conform to or reflect reimbursement regulations, since\nthey have and will continue to change. It is anticipated that an omnibus annual\n\nMedicaid cost report will reflect both the uniform reporting concepts and\nreimbursement regulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n450.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
