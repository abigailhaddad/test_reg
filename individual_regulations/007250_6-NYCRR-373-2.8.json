  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.8 - Financial requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe\nrequirements of subdivisions (c), (d) and (h)-(j) of this section apply to\nowners and operators of all hazardous waste facilities, except as provided\notherwise in this section or in section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nThe requirements of\nsubdivisions (e) and (f) of this section apply only to owners and operators of: (i) disposal facilities; (ii)\npiles, and surface impoundments from\nwhich the owner or operator intends to remove the wastes at closure, to the\nextent that these sections are made applicable to such facilities in sections\n373-2.11\n(f) and\n373-2.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart; (iii)\ntank systems\nthat are required under section\n373-2.10\n(h) of\nthis Subpart to meet the requirements for landfills; and\n(iv)\ncontainment buildings that are required\nunder section\n373-2.30\n(c) of\nthis Subpart to meet the requirements for landfills. (3)\n\nThe State and the Federal government are\nexempt from the requirements of this section. (4)\n\nThe department may replace all or part of\nthe requirements of this section applying to a regulated unit with alternative\nrequirements for financial assurance set out in the permit or in an enforceable\ndocument (as defined in section\n373-1.2\n[e][3]\nof\nthis Part, whre the department: (i) prescribes alternative requirements for the regulated unmit under sections\n373-2.6\n(a)(6)\nand/or 373-2.7(a)(3) of this Subpart; and\n(ii)\ndetermines that it is not necessary to\napply the requirements of this section because the alternative financial\nassurance requirements will protect human health and the environment. (5)\n\nThe total cost estimate for a\nfacility must include all applicable financial assurance obligations (closure, post-closure, corrective action). (b) Definitions of terms as used in\nthis section. (1)\n\nClosure\nplan\nmeans the plan for closure prepared in accordance with the\nrequirements of section\n373-2.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nCurrent\nclosure cost estimate\nmeans the most recent of the estimates prepared\nin accordance with paragraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) of this section. (3)\n\nCurrent post-closure cost\nestimate\nmeans the most recent of the estimates prepared in accordance\nwith paragraphs (e)(1), (2) and (3) of this section. (4)\n\nParent corporation\nmeans\na corporation which directly owns at least 50 percent of the voting stock of\nthe corporation which is the facility owner or operator; the latter corporation\nis deemed a subsidiary of the parent corporation. (5)\n\nPost-closure plan\nmeans\nthe plan for post-closure care prepared in accordance with the requirements of\nsection\n373-2.7\n(g) through\n(j) of this Subpart. (6)\n\nRevenue-oriented or\nrevenue-oriented hazardous waste management facility\nmeans any\nfacility (as defined in section 27-0917[7] of the ECL or Part 370 of this\n\nTitle) for which a majority of both its operating revenues and profits after\ntax at that facility, for the prior three years and for the current and next\nyear, have been and are expected to be attributable to the transportation, storing, handling, disposal, treatment or management of solid and hazardous\nwastes or related activities, or to the ownership of or leasehold or other\ninterest in any persons, facilities, or other assets engaged in or used for\nsuch activities. In making such calculations under this provision, all sources\nof operating revenues and profits (both before and after tax) shall be\nincluded. The commissioner may request any person to show, to the satisfaction\nof the commissioner, that the facility is not a revenue-oriented hazardous\nwaste management facility by this definition. The commissioner may require a\nperson to present its statements of account, independently audited by a\ncertified public accountant, and other records to make this showing. (7)\n\nThe following terms are used in the\nspecifications for the financial tests for closure, post-closure care and\nliability coverage. The definitions are intended to assist in the understanding\nof these regulations and are not intended to limit the meanings of terms in a\nway that conflicts with generally accepted accounting practices. (i) Assets\nmeans all\nexisting and all probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a\nparticular entity. (ii)\n\nCurrent assets\nmeans cash or other assets or resources\ncommonly identified as those which are reasonably expected to be realized in\ncash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the\nbusiness. (iii)\n\nCurrent\nliabilities\nmeans obligations whose liquidation is reasonably expected\nto require the use of existing resources properly classifiable as current\nassets or the creation of other current liabilities. (iv)\n\nCurrent plugging and abandonment\ncost estimate\nmeans the most recent of the estimates prepared in\naccordance with\n40 CFR\n144.62\n(see section 370.1[e] of this\n\nTitle). (v) Independently\naudited\nrefers to an audit performed by an independent certified\npublic accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing\nstandards. (vi)\n\nLiabilities\nmeans probable future sacrifices of economic\nbenefits arising from present obligations to transfer assets or provide\nservices to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or\nevents. (vii)\n\nNet working\ncapital\nmeans current assets minus current liabilities. (viii)\n\nNet worth\nmeans total\nassets minus total liabilities, and is equivalent to owner's equity. (ix)\n\nTangible net worth\nmeans the tangible assets that remain after deducting liabilities; such assets\nwould not include intangibles such as goodwill and rights to patents or\nroyalties. (8)\n\nIn the\nliability insurance requirements, the terms\nbodily injury\nand\nproperty damage\nshall have the meanings given to these terms\nby applicable State law. However, these terms do not include those liabilities\nwhich, consistent with standard industry practices, are excluded from coverage\nin liability policies for bodily injury and property damage. The department\nintends the meanings or other terms used in the liability insurance\nrequirements to be consistent with their common meanings within the insurance\nindustry. The definitions given below of several of the terms are intended to\nassist in the understanding of these regulations, and are not intended to limit\ntheir meanings in a way that conflicts with the general industry usage. (i) Accidental occurrence\nmeans an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended\nfrom the standpoint of the insured. (ii)\n\nLegal defense costs\nmeans any expenses that an insurer incurs in defending against claims of third\nparties brought under the terms and conditions of an insurance\npolicy. (iii)\n\nNonsudden\naccidental occurrence\nmeans an occurrence which takes place over time\nand involves continuous or repeated exposure. (iv)\n\nSudden accidental\noccurrence\nmeans an occurrence which is not continuous or repeated in\nnature. (9)\n\nSubstantial business relationship\nmeans the extent of a\nbusiness relationship necessary under applicable State law to make a guarantee\ncontract issued incident to that relationship valid and enforceable. A\nsubstantial business relationship must arise from a pattern of recent or\nongoing business transactions, in addition to the guarantee itself, such that a\ncurrently existing business relationship between the guarantor and the owner or\noperator is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commissioner. (c) Cost estimates for\nclosure. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust have a detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of\nclosing the facility in accordance with the requirements in section\n373-2.7\n(b) through\n(f) and applicable closure requirements in\nsections\n373-2.9\n(i), 373-2.10\n(h), 373-2.11\n(f), 373-2.12\n(h), 373-2.14\n(g), 373-2.15\n(h), 373-2.24\n(b), (c) and\n(d), and\n373-2.30\n(c) of\nthis Subpart. (i) The estimate must equal the\ncost of final closure at the point in the facility's active life when the\nextent and manner of its operation would make closure the most expensive, as\nindicated by its closure plan (see section\n373-2.7\n[c] [2]\nof\nthis Subpart). (ii)\n\nThe closure\ncost estimate must be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a\nthird party to close the facility. A third party is a party who is neither a\nparent nor a subsidiary of the owner or operator. (See definition of parent\ncorporation in subdivision [b] of this section). The owner or operator may use\ncosts for onsite disposal if the owner or operator can demonstrate that onsite\ndisposal capacity will exist at all times over the life of the\nfacility. (iii)\n\nThe closure cost\nestimate may not incorporate any salvage value that may be realized with the\nsale of hazardous wastes, or nonhazardous wastes if applicable under section\n373-2.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart, facility structures or equipment, land, or other assets\nassociated with the facility at the time of partial or final closure. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator may not\nincorporate a zero cost for hazardous wastes, or nonhazardous wastes if\napplicable under section\n373-2.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart, that might have economic value. (2)\n\nDuring the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must adjust the closure cost estimate for inflation\nwithin 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the establishment of the\nfinancial instruments used to comply with subdivision (d) of this section. For\nowners and operators using the financial test or corporate guarantee, the\nclosure cost estimate must be updated for inflation within 30 days after the\nclose of the firm's fiscal year and before submission of updated information to\nthe commissioner as specified in section\n373-2.8\n(d)(5)(iii)\nof this Subpart. The adjustment may be made by recalculating the maximum costs\nof closure in current dollars, or by using an inflation factor derived from the\nmost recent\n\nImplicit Price Deflator for Gross Domestic Product\npublished by the U.S. Department of Commerce in its\n\nSurvey of Current\n\nBusiness, as specified in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph. The inflation factor is the result of dividing the latest published\nannual deflator by the deflator for the previous year. (i) The first adjustment is made by\nmultiplying the closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result is\nthe adjusted closure cost estimate. (ii)\n\nSubsequent adjustments are made by\nmultiplying the latest adjusted closure cost estimate by the latest inflation\nfactor. (3)\n\nDuring the\nactive life of the facility, the owner or operator must revise the closure cost\nestimate no later than 30 days after the commissioner has approved the request\nto modify the closure plan, if the change in the closure plan increases the\ncost of closure. The revised closure cost estimate must be adjusted for\ninflation as specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator must keep the\nfollowing at the facility during the operating life of the facility: the latest\nclosure cost estimate prepared in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (3) of\nthis subdivision and, when this estimate has been adjusted in accordance with\nparagraph (2), the latest adjusted closure cost estimate. (d) Financial assurance for\nclosure. An owner or operator of each facility must establish\nfinancial assurance for closure of the facility. The owner or operator must\nchoose from the options as specified in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this\nsubdivision. An owner or operator may also use a combination of the options\nspecified in paragraphs (1) through (8) to provide the total amount of\nfinancial assurance for the closure of the facility. (1)\n\nClosure trust fund. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by establishing a closure trust fund which\nconforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally\nsigned duplicate of the trust agreement to the commissioner at least 60 days\nbefore the date on which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage or disposal. The trustee must be an entity which has the authority to\nact as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a\n\nFederal or State agency. (ii)\n\nThe\nwording of the trust agreement must be identical to the wording specified in\nparagraph (j)(1) of this section, and the trust agreement must be accompanied\nby a formal certification of acknowledgement (for example, see the end of\nparagraph [j][1]). Schedule A of the trust agreement must be updated within 60\ndays after a change in the amount of the current closure cost estimate covered\nby the agreement. (iii)\n\nPayments\ninto the trust fund must be made annually by the owner or operator over the\nfirst five years of operation or over the remaining operating life of the\nfacility as estimated in the closure plan, whichever period is shorter; this\nperiod is hereinafter referred to as the \"pay-in period.\" The payments into the\nclosure trust fund must be made as follows: (a) For a new or revenue-oriented facility, the first payment must be equal to the total closure cost estimate, or an\nalternative mechanism must be provided which, when combined with the trust\nfund, provides financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the current\nclosure cost estimate. For a new facility, this payment will be made before the\ninitial receipt of hazardous waste for treatment, storage or disposal. A\nreceipt from the trustee for this payment must be submitted by the owner or\noperator to the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation before this initial\nreceipt of hazardous waste. For a revenue-oriented facility, the first payment\nis due 90 days after the date that these regulations are promulgated. (b) For an existing facility which is not\nrevenue-oriented, the first payment must be at least equal to the current\nclosure cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision, divided by the number of years in the pay-in period. Subsequent payments must\nbe made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The amount of each subsequent payment must be determined by this formula: Next payment\n=\nCE-CV\n/\nY\nwhere CE is the current closure cost estimate, CV is the\ncurrent value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in the\npay-in period. (c) If an\nowner or operator establishes a trust fund as specified in this paragraph, and\nthe value of that trust fund is less than the current closure cost estimate\nwhen a permit is awarded for the facility, the amount of the current closure\ncost estimate still to be paid into the trust fund must be paid in over the\npay-in period as defined in this subparagraph. Payments must continue to be\nmade no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment\nmade pursuant to Subpart 373-3 of this Part. The amount of each payment must be\ndetermined by this formula: Next payment\n=\nCE-CV\n/\nY\nwhere CE is the current closure cost estimate, CV is the\ncurrent value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in the\npay-in period. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator may accelerate\npayments into the trust fund or may deposit the full amount of the current\nclosure cost estimate at the time the fund is established. However, the owner\nor operator must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value that\nthe fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph. (v) If the\nowner or operator established a closure trust fund after having used one or\nmore alternate mechanisms specified in this section or in section\n373-3.8\n(d) of this\n\nPart, the first payment must be in at least the amount that the fund would\ncontain if the trust fund were established initially and annual payments made\naccording to specifications of this paragraph and section\n373-3.8\n(d)(1), as\napplicable. (vi)\n\nAfter the pay-in\nperiod is completed, whenever the current closure cost estimate changes, the\nowner or operator must compare the new estimate with the trustee's most recent\nannual valuation of the trust fund. If the value of the fund is less than the\namount of the new estimate, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the\nchange in the cost estimate, must either deposit an amount into the fund so\nthat its value after this deposit at least equals the amount of the current\nclosure cost estimate, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision to cover the difference. (vii)\n\nIf the value of the trust fund is\ngreater than the total amount of the current closure cost estimate, the owner\nor operator may submit a written request to the commissioner for release of the\namount in excess of the current closure cost estimate. (viii)\n\nIf an owner or operator substitutes\nother financial assurance as specified in this subdivision for all or part of\nthe trust fund, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the\ncommissioner for release of the amount in excess of the current closure cost\nestimate covered by the trust fund. (ix)\n\nWithin 60 days after receiving a request\nfrom the owner or operator for release of funds as specified in subparagraphs\n(vii) and (viii) of this paragraph, the commissioner will instruct the trustee\nto release to the owner or operator such funds as the commissioner specifies in\nwriting. (x) After beginning\npartial or final closure, an owner or operator or another person authorized to\nconduct partial or final closure may request reimbursements for partial or\nfinal closure expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the commissioner. The owner or operator may request reimbursements for partial closure only if\nsufficient funds are remaining in the trust fund to cover the maximum costs of\nclosing the facility over its remaining operating life. Within 60 days after\nreceiving bills for partial or final closure activities, the commissioner will\ninstruct the trustee to make reimbursements in those amounts as the\ncommissioner specifies in writing, if the commissioner determines that the\npartial or final closure expenditures are in accordance with the approved\nclosure plan, or otherwise justified. If the commissioner has reason to believe\nthat the maximum cost of closure over the remaining life of the facility will\nbe significantly greater than the value of the trust fund, the commissioner may\nwithhold reimbursements of such amounts as he or she deems prudent until the\ncommissioner determines, in accordance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision, that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial\nassurance for final closure of the facility. If the commissioner does not\ninstruct the trustee to make such reimbursements, the commissioner will provide\nthe owner or operator with a detailed written statement of reasons. (xi)\n\nThe commissioner will agree to\ntermination of the trust when: (a) an owner or\noperator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision; or\n(b) the\ncommissioner releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this\nsubdivision in accordance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nSurety\nbond. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy\nthe requirements of this subdivision by obtaining a surety bond which conforms\nto the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the\ncommissioner. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the bond to\nthe commissioner at least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is\nfirst received for treatment, storage or disposal. The bond must be effective\nbefore this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The surety company issuing the\nbond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties on\n\nFederal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the surety bond must be\nidentical to the wording specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nThe owner or\noperator who uses a surety bond to satisfy the requirements of this subdivision\nmust also establish a standby trust fund.. Under the terms of the bond, all\npayments made thereunder will be deposited by the surety directly into the\nstandby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the commissioner. The\nstandby trust fund must meet the requirements specified in paragraph(1) of this\nsubdivision, except that: (a) an originally\nsigned duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the commissioner\nwith the surety bond; and\n(b) until\nthe standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this\nsubdivision, the following are not required by these regulations: (1)\npayments into the trust fund as specified\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (2)\nupdating of Schedule A of the trust\nagreement (see paragraph [j][1] of this section) to show current closure cost\nestimates; (3)\nannual valuations as\nrequired by the trust agreement; and\n(4)\nnotices of nonpayment as required by the\ntrust agreement. (iv)\n\nThe bond must guarantee that the owner\nor operator will: (a) fund the standby trust\nfund in an amount equal to the penal sum of the bond before the beginning of\nfinal closure of the facility; or\n(b) fund the standby trust fund in an amount\nequal to the penal sum within 15 days after an order to begin final closure is\nissued by the commissioner or a U.S. district court or other court of competent\njurisdiction; or\n(c) provide\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision, and obtain the\ncommissioner's written approval of the assurance provided, within 90 days after\nreceipt by both the owner or operator and the commissioner of a notice of\ncancellation of the bond from the surety. (v) Under the terms of the bond, the surety\nwill become liable on the bond obligation when the owner or operator fails to\nperform as guaranteed by the bond. (vi)\n\nThe penal sum of the bond must be in an\namount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, except as provided\nin paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (vii)\n\nWhenever the current closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the penal sum, the owner or\noperator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the penal sum to\nbe increased to an amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate\nand submit evidence of such increase to the commissioner, or obtain other\nfinancial assurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the current closure cost estimate decreases, the penal sum may be\nreduced to the amount of the current closure cost estimate following written\napproval by the commissioner. (viii)\n\nUnder the terms of the bond, the\nsurety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator and to the commissioner. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date\nof receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the\ncommissioner, as evidenced by the return receipts. (ix)\n\nThe owner or operator may cancel the\nbond if the commissioner has given prior written consent based on the receipt\nof evidence of alternate financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nClosure\nletter of credit. (i) An owner or operator\nmay satisfy the requirements of this subdivision by obtaining an irrevocable\nstandby letter of credit which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph\nand submitting the letter to the commissioner. An owner or operator of a new\nfacility must submit the letter of credit to the commissioner at least 60 days\nbefore the date on which the hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage or disposal. The letter of credit must be effective before this initial\nreceipt of hazardous waste. The issuing institution must be an entity which has\nthe authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter-of-credit operations\nare regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the letter of credit must\nbe identical to the wording specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nAn owner or operator\nwho uses a letter of credit to satisfy the requirements of this subdivision\nmust also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the letter of\ncredit, all amounts paid pursuant to a draft by the commissioner will be\ndeposited by the issuing institution directly into the standby trust fund in\naccordance with instructions from the commissioner. This standby trust fund\nmust meet the requirements of the trust fund specified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, except that: (a) an originally\nsigned duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the commissioner\nwith the letter of credit; and\n(b) unless the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this\nsubdivision, the following are not required by these regulations: (1)\npayments into the trust fund as specified\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (2)\nupdating of Schedule A of the trust\nagreement (see paragraph [j][1] of this section) to show current closure cost\nestimates; (3)\nannual valuations as\nrequired by the trust agreement; and\n(4)\nnotices of nonpayment as required by the\ntrust agreement. (iv)\n\nThe letter of credit must be accompanies\nby a letter from the owner or operator referring to the letter of credit by\nnumber, issuing institution and date, and providing the following information: the EPA identification number, name and address of the facility, and the amount\nof funds assured for closure of the facility by the letter of credit. (v) The letter of credit must be irrevocable\nand issued for a period of at least one year. The letter of credit must provide\nthat the expiration date will be automatically extended for a period of at\nleast one year unless, at least 120 days before the current expiration date, the issuing institution notifies both the owner or operator and the\ncommissioner by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a decision not to\nextend the expiration date. Under the terms of the letter of credit, the 120\ndays will begin on the date when both the owner or operator and the\ncommissioner have received the notice, as evidenced by the return\nreceipts. (vi)\n\nThe letter of credit\nmust be issued in an amount at least equal to the current closure estimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (vii)\n\nWhenever the current closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the amount of the credit, the\nowner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the\namount of the credit to be increased so that it at least equals the current\nclosure cost estimate, and submit evidence of such increase to the\ncommissioner, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the current closure cost estimate\ndecreases, the amount of the credit may be reduced to the amount of the current\nclosure cost estimate following written approval by the commissioner. (viii)\n\nFollowing a determination, pursuant to\nsection\n373-2.7\nof this Subpart, that the\nowner or operator has failed to perform final closure in accordance with the\nclosure plan and other permit requirements when required to do so, the\ncommissioner may draw on the letter of credit. (ix)\n\nIf the owner or operator does not\nestablish alternate financial assurance, as specified in this subdivision, and\nobtain written approval of such alternate assurance from the commissioner\nwithin 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the commissioner\nof a notice from issuing institution that it has decided not to extend the\nletter of credit beyond the current expiration date, the commissioner will draw\non the letter of credit. The commissioner may delay the drawing if the issuing\ninstitution grants an extension of the term of the credit. During the last 30\ndays of any such extension, the commissioner will draw on the letter of credit\nif the owner or operator has failed to provide alternate financial assurance as\nspecified in this subdivision and obtain written approval of such assurance\nfrom the commissioner. (x) The\ncommissioner will return the letter of credit to the issuing institution for\ntermination when: (a) an owner or operator\nsubstitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases\nthe owner or operator from the requirements of this subdivision in accordance\nwith paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nClosure insurance. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by obtaining closure insurance which conforms\nto the requirements of this paragraph and submitting a certificate of such\ninsurance to the department. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit\nthe certificate of insurance to the department at least 60 days before the date\non which hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage or disposal. The insurance must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. At a minimum, the insurer must be authorized by the Superintendent of the New\n\nYork State Department of Financial Services to conduct the business of\ninsurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus lines\ninsurer, in New York State. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the wording\nspecified in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. (iii)\n\nThe closure insurance policy must be\nissued for a face amount at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision. The term limits of\nliability means the total amount the insurer is obligated to pay under the\npolicy. Actual payments by the insurer will not change the limits of liability, although the insurer's future liability will be lowered by the amount of the\npayments. (iv)\n\nThe closure\ninsurance policy must guarantee that funds will be available to close the\nfacility wherever final closure occurs. The policy must also guarantee that\nonce final closure begins, the insurer will be responsible for paying out\nfunds, up to an amount equal to the limits of liability of the policy, upon the\ndirection of the commissioner, to such party or parties as the commissioner\nspecifies. (v) After beginning\npartial or final closure, an owner or operator or any other person authorized\nto conduct closure may request reimbursements for closure expenditures by\nsubmitting itemized bills to the commissioner. The owner or operator may\nrequest reimbursements for partial closure only if the remaining value of the\npolicy is sufficient to cover the maximum costs of closing the facility over\nits remaining operating life. Within 60 days after receiving bills for closure\nactivities, the commissioner will instruct the insurer to make reimbursements\nin such amounts as the commissioner specifies in writing, if the commissioner\ndetermines that the partial or final closure expenditures are in accordance\nwith the approved closure plan, or otherwise justified. If the commissioner has\nreason to believe that the maximum cost of closure over the remaining life of\nthe facility will be significantly greater than the face amount of the policy, the commissioner may withhold reimbursements of such amounts as he or she deems\nprudent until the commissioner determines, in accordance with paragraph (8) of\nthis subdivision, that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain\nfinancial assurance for final closure of the facility. If the commissioner does\nnot instruct the insurer to make such reimbursements, the commissioner will\nprovide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of\nreasons. (vi)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust maintain the policy in full force and effect until the commissioner\nconsents to termination of the policy by the owner or operator as specified in\nsubparagraph (x) of this paragraph. Failure to pay the premium, without\nsubstitution of alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision, will constitute a significant violation of these regulations, warranting such\nremedy as the commissioner deems necessary. Such violation will begin upon\nreceipt by the commissioner of a notice of future cancellation, termination or\nfailure to renew due to nonpayment of the premium, rather than upon the date of\nexpiration. (vii)\n\nEach policy must\ncontain a provision allowing assignment of the policy to a successor owner or\noperator. Such assignment may be conditional upon consent of the insurer, provided such consent is not unreasonably refused. (viii)\n\nThe policy must provide that the\ninsurer may not cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy except for\nfailure to pay the premium. The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a\nminimum, provide the insured with the option of renewal at the limits of\nliability of the expiring policy. If there is a failure to pay the premium, the\ninsurer may elect to cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy by sending\nnotice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator\nand the commissioner. Cancellation, termination or failure to renew amy not\noccur, however, during the 120 days beginning with the date of receipt of the\nnotice by both the commissioner and the owner or operator, as evidenced by the\nreturn receipts. Cancellation, termination or failure to renew may not occur\nand the policy will remain in full force and effect in the event that on or\nbefore the date of expiration: (a) the\ncommissioner deems the facility abandoned; (b) interim status is terminated or\nrevoked; (c) closure is ordered by\nthe commissioner or a United States district court or other court of competent\njurisdiction; (d) the owner or\noperator is named as debtor in a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under\n11\nUSC\nA (Bankruptcy); or\n(e) the\npremium due is paid. (ix)\n\nWhenever the current closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the limits of liability of the\npolicy; the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either\ncause the limits of liability to be increased to an amount at least equal to\nthe current closure cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the\ncommissioner, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the current closure cost estimate\ndecreases, the limits of liability may be reduced to the amount of the current\nclosure cost estimate following written approval by the commissioner. (x) The commissioner will give written\nconsent to the owner or operator that the insurance policy may be terminated\nwhen: (a) an owner or operator substitutes\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases the owner or\noperator from the requirements of this subdivision in accordance with paragraph\n(8) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nFinancial test and guarantee for closure. (i) An owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility, may satisfy the requirements of this\nsubdivision by demonstrating that the owner or operator passes a financial test\nas specified in this paragraph. No revenue-oriented facilities will be allowed\nto use this financial assurance mechanism. To pass this test, the owner or\noperator must meet the criteria of either clause (a) or (b) of this\nsubparagraph. (a) The owner or operator must\nhave: (1)\ntwo of the following three ratios: a ratio of total liabilities to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of\nnet income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization to total liabilities\ngreater than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater\nthan 1.5; (2)\nnet working capital\nand tangible net worth each at least six times the sum of the current closure\nand post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and abandonment cost\nestimates; (3)\ntangible net worth\nof at least $10 million; and\n(4)\nassets in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of total assets or\nat least six times the sum of the current closure and post-closure cost\nestimates and the current plugging and abandonment costs. (b) The owner or operator must have: (1)\na current rating for their most recent\nbond insurance of AAA, AA, A or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's, or Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa as issued by Moody's; (2)\ntangible net worth at least six times the\nsum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current\nplugging and abandonment costs; (3)\ntangible net worth of at least $10 million; and\n(4)\nassets located in the United States\namounting to at least 90 percent of total assets or at least six times the sum\nof the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging\nand abandonment costs. (ii)\n\nThe phrases \"current closure and\npost-closure cost estimates\" and \"current plugging and abandonment cost\nestimates,\" as used in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph refers to the cost\nestimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-4 of the letter from the owner's\nor operator's chief financial officer. (ii)\n\nTo demonstrate that he or she meets this\ntest, the owner or operator must submit the following items to the\ncommissioner: (a) a letter signed by the\nowner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in\nparagraph (j)(5) of this section; (b) a copy of the independent certified\npublic accountant's report on examination of the owner's or operator's\nfinancial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and\n(c) a special report from the owner's or\noperator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator, stating that: (1)\nthe accountant has compared\nthe data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies as having\nbeen derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for\nthe latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements; and\n(2)\nin connection with that\nprocedure, no matters came to the accountant's attention which caused the\naccountant to believe that the specified data should be adjusted. (iv)\n\nAn owner or\noperator of a new facility must submit the items specified in subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph to the commissioner at least 60 days before the date on\nwhich hazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage or\ndisposal. (v) After the initial\nsubmission of items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, the\nowner or operator must send updated information to the commissioner within 90\ndays after the close of each succeeding fiscal year. This information must\nconsist of all three items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. (vi)\n\nIf the owner or\noperator no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, the owner or operator must send notice to the commissioner of intent\nto establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision. The notice must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 90\ndays after the end of the fiscal year for which the year-end financial data\nshow that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements. The owner or\noperator must provide the alternate financial assurance within 120 days after\nthe end of such fiscal year. (vii)\n\nThe commissioner may, based on reasonable belief that the owner or operator may\nno longer meet the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, require\nreports of financial condition at any time from the owner or operator in\naddition to those specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. If the\ncommissioner finds, on the basis of such reports or other information that the\nowner or operator no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as\nspecified in this subdivision within 30 days after notification of such a\nfinding. (viii)\n\nThe commissioner\nmay disallow use of this test on the basis of qualifications in the opinion\nexpressed by the independent certified public accountant in his or her report\non examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements (see clause\n[iii][\nb\n] of this paragraph). An adverse opinion or a\ndisclaimer of opinion will be cause for disallowance. The commissioner will\nevaluate other qualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator\nmust provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision\nwithin 30 days after notification of the disallowance. (ix)\n\nThe owner or operator is no longer\nrequired to submit the items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph\nwhen: (a) an owner or operator substitutes\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases the owner or\noperator from the requirements of this subdivision in accordance with paragraph\n(8) of this subdivision. (x) An owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility may meet the requirements of this\nsubdivision by obtaining a written guarantee, herein after referred to as\n\"guarantee.\" If the firm which is providing the guarantee does not meet the\ndefinition of revenue-oriented in this section or section\n373-3.8\nof this Part, it may\nprovide the guarantee on behalf of the owner or operator even if the owner or\noperator is a \"revenue-oriented\" facility. For a revenue-oriented facility, the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator cannot be consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. The guarantor must be the direct or\nhigher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent\ncorporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm\nwith a \"substantial business relationship\" with the owner or operator. The\nguarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in subparagraphs\n(i) through (viii) of this paragraph and must comply with the terms of the\nguarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording\nspecified in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. A certified copy of the\nguarantee must accompany the items sent to the commissioner as specified in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. One of these items must be the letter\nfrom the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's parent\ncorporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, the letter\nmust describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the\nguarantor is a firm with a substantial business relationship with the owner or\noperator, this letter must describe this substantial business relationship and\nthe value received in consideration of the guarantee. The terms of the\nguarantee must provide that: (a) If the owner\nor operator fails to perform final closure of a facility covered by the\nguarantee in accordance with the closure plan and other permit requirements\nwhenever required to do so, the guarantor will do so or make payment as the\ncommissioner shall direct in writing. (b) The guarantee will remain in force unless\nthe guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail, return receipt\nrequested, to the owner or operator and to the commissioner. Cancellation may\nnot occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the\nnotice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the commissioner, as\nevidenced by the return receipts. (c) If the owner or operator fails to provide\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision and obtain the\nwritten approval of such alternate assurance from the commissioner within 90\ndays after receipt by both the owner or operator and the commissioner of a\nnotice of cancellation of the guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will\nprovide such alternative financial assurance in the name of the owner or\noperator. (6)\n\nUse of multiple financial mechanisms. An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by establishing more than one financial\nmechanism per facility. These mechanism are limited to trust funds, surety\nbonds, letters of credit, and insurance. The mechanisms must be as specified in\nparagraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4), respectively, of this subdivision, except\nthat it is the combination of mechanisms, rather than the single mechanism, which must provide financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent closure cost estimate. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in\ncombination with a surety bond or a letter of credit, the trust fund may be\nused as the standby trust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust\nfund, if required, may be established for two or more mechanisms. The\ncommissioner may use any or all of the mechanisms to provide for closure of the\nfacility. (7)\n\nUse of a financial\nmechanism for multiple facilities. An owner or operator may use a financial\nassurance mechanism specified in this subdivision to meet the requirements of\nthis subdivision for more than one facility. Evidence of financial assurance\nsubmitted to the commissioner must include a list showing, for each facility, the EPA identification number, name, address, and the amount of funds for\nclosure assured by the mechanism. The amount of funds available through the\nmechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be available if a\nseparate mechanism had been established and maintained for each facility. In\ndirecting funds available through the mechanism for closure of any of the\nfacilities covered by the mechanism, the commissioner may direct only the\namount of funds designated for that facility, unless the owner or operator\nagrees to the use of additional funds available under the mechanism. (8)\n\nRelease of the owner or operator from the\nrequirements of this subdivision. Within 60 days after receiving certifications\nfrom the owner or operator and in independent professional engineer registered\nin New York that final closure has been completed in accordance with the\napproved closure plan, the commissioner will notify the owner or operator in\nwriting that the owner or operator is no longer required by this subdivision to\nmaintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility, unless the\ncommissioner has reason to believe that final closure has not been in\naccordance with the approved closure plan. The commissioner shall provide the\nowner or operator a detailed written statement of any reason to believe that\nclosure has not been in accordance with the approved closure\nplan. (e) Cost\nestimate for post-closure care. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of a disposal surface impoundment, disposal miscellaneous\nunit, land treatment unit, or landfill unit, or of a surface impoundment or\nwaste pile, required under sections\n373-2.11\n(f) and\n373-2.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart to prepare a contingent closure and post- closure plan, must have\na detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the annual cost of post-\nclosure monitoring and maintenance of the facility in accordance with the\napplicable post- closure regulations in sections\n373-2.7\n(g)-(j), 373-2.11\n(f), 373-2.12\n(h), 373-2.13\n(h), 373-2.14\n(g) and\n373-2.24\n(d) of\nthis Subpart. (i) The post-closure cost\nestimate must be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a third\nparty to conduct post-closure care activities. A third party is a party who is\nneither a parent nor subsidiary of the owner or operator (see definition of\nparent corporation in subdivision [b] of this section). (ii)\n\nThe post-closure cost estimate is\ncalculated by multiplying the annual post-closure cost estimate by the number\nof years of post-closure care required under section\n373-2.7\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nDuring the\nactive life of the facility, the owner or operator must adjust the post-closure\ncost estimate for inflation within 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the\nestablishment of the financial instruments used to comply with section\n373-2.8\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart. For owners or operators using the financial test or corporate\nguarantee, the post-closure cost estimate must be updated for inflation within\n30 days after the close of the firm's fiscal year and before submission of\nupdated information to the commissioner as specified in section\n373-2.8\n(f)(5)(v)\nof this Subpart. The adjustment may be made by recalculating the post-closure\ncost estimate in current dollars, or by using an inflation factor derived from\nthe most recent Implicit Price Deflator for Gross Domestic Product published by\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce in its Survey of Current Business, as specified\nin subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. The inflation factor is the\nresult of dividing the latest published annual deflator by the deflator for the\nprevious year. (i) The first adjustment is\nmade by multiplying the post-closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The\nresult is the adjusted post-closure cost estimate. (ii)\n\nSubsequent adjustments are made by\nmultiplying the latest post-closure estimate by the latest inflation\nfactor. (3)\n\nDuring the\nactive life of the facility, the owner or operator must revise the post-closure\ncost estimate no later than 30 days after the commissioner has approved the\nrequest to modify the post-closure plan, if the change in the post-closure plan\nincreases the cost of post-closure care. The revised post-closure cost estimate\nmust be adjusted for inflation as specified in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (4)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must keep the following at the facility during the operating life of\nthe facility: the latest post-closure cost estimate prepared in accordance with\nparagraphs (1) and (3) of this subdivision and, when this estimate has been\nadjusted in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the latest\nadjusted post-closure cost estimate. (f) Financial assurance for\npost-closure care. The owner or operator of a hazardous waste\nmanagement unit subject to the requirements of subdivision (e) of this section\nmust establish financial assurance for post-closure care in accordance with the\napproved post-closure plan for the facility 60 days prior to the initial\nreceipt of hazardous waste or the effective date of regulation, whichever is\nlater. The owner or operator must choose from the following options: (1)\n\nPost-closure trust fund. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by establishing a post-closure trust fund\nwhich conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an\noriginally signed duplicate of the trust agreement of the commissioner. An\nowner or operator of a new facility must submit the originally signed duplicate\nof the trust agreement to the commissioner at least 60 days before the date on\nwhich hazardous waste is first received for disposal. The trustee must be an\nentity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations\nare regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the trust agreement must\nbe identical to the wording specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, and\nthe trust agreement must be accompanied by a formal certification of\nacknowledgement (for example, see paragraph [j][1]). Schedule A of the trust\nagreement must be updated within 60 days after a change in the amount of the\ncurrent post- closure cost estimate covered by the agreement. (iii)\n\nPayments into the trust fund must be\nmade annually by the owner or operator over the first five years of operation\nor over the remaining operating life of the facility as estimated in the\nclosure plan, whichever period is shorter; this period is hereinafter referred\nto as the \"pay-in-period.\" The payments into the post-closure trust fund must\nbe made as follows: (a) For a new or\nrevenue-oriented facility, the first payment must be equal to the total\npost-closure cost estimate, or an alternative mechanism must be provided which, when combined with the trust fund, provides financial assurance for an amount\nat least equal to the current closure cost estimate. (b) For a new facility, the first payment\nmust be made before the initial receipt of hazardous waste. For a\nrevenue-oriented facility, the first payment is due 90 days after the date that\nthese regulations are promulgated. For existing facilities which are not\nrevenue-oriented facilities, the first payment must be at least equal to the\ncurrent post-closure cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision, divided by the number of years in the pay-in period. Subsequent\npayments must be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the\nfirst payment. The amount of each subsequent payment must be determined by this\nformula: Next payment =\nCE-CV\n/\nY\nwhere CE is the current post-closure cost estimate, CV is\nthe current value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in\nthe pay-in period. (c) If an\nowner or operator establishes a trust fund as specified in this paragraph, and\nthe value of that trust fund is less than the current post-closure cost\nestimate when a permit is awarded for the facility, the amount of the current\npos-closure cost estimate still to be paid into the fund must be paid in over\nthe pay-in period as defined in this subparagraph. Payments must continue to be\nmade no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment\nmade pursuant to this Subpart. The amount of each payment must be determined by\nthis formula: Next payment\n=\nCE-CV\n/\nY\nwhere CE is the current post-closure cost estimate, CV is\nthe current value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in\nthe pay-in period. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator may accelerate\npayments into the trust fund or may deposit the full amount of the current\npost-closure cost estimate at the time the fund is established. However, the\nowner or operator must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value\nthat the fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (v) If the owner or operator establishes a\npost-closure trust fund after having used one or more alternate mechanisms\nspecified in this subdivision or in section\n373-3.8\n(f) of this\n\nPart, the first payment must be in at least the amount that the fund would\ncontain if the trust fund were established initially and annual payments made\naccording to specifications of this paragraph and section\n373-3.8\n(f)(1), as\napplicable. (vi)\n\nAfter the pay-in\nperiod is completed, whenever the current post-closure cost estimate changes\nduring the operating life of the facility, the owner or operator must compare\nthe new estimate with the trustee's most recent annual valuation of the trust\nfund. If the value of the fund is less than the amount of the new estimate, the\nowner or operator, within 60 days after the change in the cost estimate, must\neither deposit an amount into the fund so that its value after this deposit at\nleast equals the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate, or obtain\nother financial assurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the\ndifference. (vii)\n\nDuring the\noperating life of the facility, if the value of the trust fund is greater than\nthe total amount of the current post-closure cost estimate, the owner or\noperator may submit a written request to the commissioner for release of the\namount in excess of the current post- closure cost estimate. (viii)\n\nIf an owner or operator substitutes\nother financial assurance as specified in this subdivision for all or part of\nthe trust fund, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the\ncommissioner for release of the amount in excess of the current post-closure\ncost estimate covered by the trust fund. (ix)\n\nWithin 60 days after receiving a request\nfrom the owner or operator for release of funds as specified in subparagraph\n(vii) or (viii) of this paragraph, the commissioner will instruct the trustee\nto release to the owner or operator such funds as the commissioner specifies in\nwriting. (x) During the period of\npost-closure care, the commissioner may approve a release of funds if the owner\nor operator demonstrates to the commissioner that the value of the trust fund\nexceeds the remaining cost of post-closure care. (xi)\n\nAn owner or operator or another person\nauthorized to conduct post-closure care may request reimbursements for\npost-closure care expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the\ncommissioner. Within 60 days after receiving bills for post-closure care\nactivities, the commissioner will instruct the trustee to make reimbursements\nin those amounts the commissioner specifies in writing, if the commissioner\ndetermines that the post-closure care expenditures are in accordance with the\napproved post-closure plan, or otherwise justified. If the commissioner does\nnot instruct the trustee to make reimbursements, the commissioner will provide\nthe owner or operator with a detailed written statement of reasons. (xii)\n\nThe commissioner will agree to\ntermination of the trust when: (a) an owner\nor operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision; or\n(b) the\ncommissioner releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this\nsubdivision in accordance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nSurety bond. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by obtaining a surety bond which conforms to\nthe requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the commissioner. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit the bond to the commissioner\nat least 60 days before the date on which hazardous waste is first received for\ndisposal. The bond must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous\nwaste. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those\nlisted as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the surety bond must be identical to the wording specified in\nparagraph (j)(2) of this section. (iii)\n\nThe owner or operator who uses a surety\nbond to satisfy the requirements of this subdivision must also establish a\nstandby trust fund. Under the terms of the bond, all payments made thereunder\nwill be deposited by the surety directly into the standby trust fund in\naccordance with instructions from the commissioner. This standby trust fund\nmust meet the requirements specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except that: (a) an originally signed\nduplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the commissioner with the\nsurety bond; and\n(b) until the\nstandby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this subdivision, the following are not required by these regulations: (1)\npayments into the trust fund as specified\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (2)\nupdating of Schedule A of the trust\nagreement (see paragraph [j][1] of this section) to show current post-closure\ncost-estimates; (3)\nannual\nvaluations as required by the trust agreement; and\n(4)\nnotices of nonpayment as required by the\ntrust agreement. (iv)\n\nThe bond must guarantee that the owner\nor operator will: (a) fund the standby trust\nfund in an amount equal to the penal sum of the bond before the beginning of\nfinal closure of the facility; (b) fund the standby trust fund in an amount equal to the penal sum within 15 days\nafter an order to begin final closure is issued by the commissioner or a United\n\nStates district court or other court of competent jurisdiction; or\n(c) provide alternate financial assurance as\nspecified in this subdivision, and obtain the commissioner's written approval\nof the assurance provided, within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or\noperator and the commissioner of a notice of cancellation of the bond from the\nsurety. (v) Under the\nterms of the bond, the surety will become liable on the bond obligation when\nthe owner or operator fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond. (vi)\n\nThe penal sum of the bond must be in an\namount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate, except as\nprovided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (vii)\n\nWhenever the current post-closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the penal sum, the owner or\noperator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the penal sum to\nbe increased to an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost\nestimate and submit evidence of such increase to the commissioner, or obtain\nother financial assurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the\nincrease. Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate decreases, the penal\nsum may be reduced to the amount of the current post-closure cost estimate\nfollowing written approval by the commissioner. (viii)\n\nUnder the terms of the bond, the\nsurety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation, by certified\nmail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator and to the\ncommissioner. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days\nbeginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the\nowner or operator and the commissioner, as evidenced by the return\nreceipts. (ix)\n\nThe owner or\noperator may cancel the bond if the commissioner has given prior written\nconsent based on the receipt of evidence of alternate financial assurance as\nspecified in this subdivision. (3)\n\nPost-closure letter of credit. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by obtaining an irrevocable standby letter of\ncredit which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the\nletter to the commissioner. An owner or operator of a new facility must submit\nthe letter of credit to the commissioner at least 60 days before the date on\nwhich hazardous waste is first received for disposal. The letter of credit must\nbe effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. The issuing\ninstitution must be an entity which has the authority to issue letters of\ncredit and whose letter of credit operations are regulated and examined by a\n\nFederal or State agency. (ii)\n\nThe\nwording of the letter of credit must be identical to the wording specified in\nparagraph (j)(3) of this section. (iii)\n\nAn owner or operator who uses a letter\nof credit to satisfy the requirements of this subdivision must also establish a\nstandby trust fund. Under the terms of the letter of credit, all amounts paid\npursuant to a draft by the commissioner will be deposited by the issuing\ninstitution directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with\ninstructions from the commissioner. This standby trust fund must meet the\nrequirements of the trust fund specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except that: (a) an originally signed\nduplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the commissioner with the\nletter of credit; and\n(b) unless\nthe standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this\nsubdivision, the following are not required by these regulations: (1)\npayments into the trust fund as specified\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (2)\nupdating of Schedule A of the trust\nagreement (see paragraph [j][1] of this section) to show current post-closure\ncost estimates; (3)\nannual\nvaluations as required by the trust agreement; and\n(4)\nnotices of nonpayment as required by the\ntrust agreement. (iv)\n\nThe letter of credit must be accompanied\nby a letter from the owner or operator referring to the letter of credit by\nnumber, issuing institution and date, and providing the following information: the EPA identification number, name and address of the facility, and the amount\nof funds assured for the post-closure care of the facility by the letter of\ncredit. (v) The letter of credit\nmust be irrevocable and issued for a period of at least one year. The letter of\ncredit must provide that the expiration date will be automatically extended for\na period of at least one year unless, at least 120 days before the current\nexpiration date, the issuing institution notifies both the owner or operator\nand the commissioner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a\ndecision not to extend the expiration date. Under the terms of the letter of\ncredit, the 120 days will begin on the date when both the owner or operator and\nthe commissioner have received the notice, as evidenced by the return\nreceipts. (vi)\n\nThe letter of credit\nmust be issued in an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost\nestimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (vii)\n\nWhenever the current post-closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the amount of the credit during\nthe operating life of the facility, the owner or operator, within 60 days after\nthe increase, must either cause the amount of the letter of credit to be\nincreased so that it at least equals the current post-closure cost estimate, and submit evidence of such increase to the commissioner, or obtain other\nfinancial assurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate decreases during the operating\nlife of the facility, the amount of the credit may be reduced to the amount of\nthe current post-closure cost estimate following written approval by the\ncommissioner. (viii)\n\nDuring the\nperiod of post-closure care, the commissioner may approve a decrease in the\namount of the letter of credit if the owner or operator demonstrates to the\ncommissioner that the amount exceeds the remaining cost of post-closure\ncare. (ix)\n\nFollowing a\ndetermination, pursuant to section\n373-2.7\nof this Subpart, that the\nowner or operator has failed to perform post-closure care in accordance with\nthe post-closure plan and other permit requirements, the commissioner may draw\non the letter of credit. (x) If the\nowner or operator does not establish alternate financial assurance as specified\nin this subdivision, and obtain written approval of such alternate assurance\nfrom the commissioner within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or\noperator and the commissioner of a notice from the issuing institution that it\nhas decided not to extend the letter of credit beyond the current expiration\ndate, the commissioner will draw on the letter of credit. The commissioner may\ndelay the drawings if the issuing institution grants an extension of the term\nof the credit. During the last 30 days of any such extension, the commissioner\nwill draw on the letter of credit if the owner or operator has failed to\nprovide alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision and\nobtain written approval of such assurance from the commissioner. (xi)\n\nThe commissioner will return the letter\nof credit to the issuing institution for termination when: (a) an owner or operator substitutes\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases the owner or\noperator from the requirements of this subdivision in accordance with paragraph\n(8) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nPost-closure insurance. (i) An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by obtaining post-closure insurance which\nconforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting a certificate of\nsuch insurance to the commissioner. An owner or operator of a new facility must\nsubmit the certificate of insurance to the commissioner at least 60 days before\nthe date on which hazardous waste is first received for disposal. The insurance\nmust be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous waste. At a minimum, the insurer must be authorized by the superintendent of the New York State\n\nInsurance Department to conduct the business of insurance, or eligible to\nprovide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer, in New York\n\nState. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the\ncertificate of insurance must be identical to the wording specified in\nparagraph (j)(4) of this section. (iii)\n\nThe post-closure insurance policy must\nbe issued for a limit of liability at least equal to the current post-closure\ncost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision. The\nterm limits of liability means the total amount the insurer is obligated to pay\nunder the policy. Actual payments by the insurer will not change the limits if\nliability, although the insurer's future liability will be lowered by the\namount of the payments. (iv)\n\nThe\npost-closure insurance policy must guarantee that funds will be available to\nprovide post-closure care of the facility whenever the post-closure period\nbegins. This policy must also guarantee that once post-closure care begins, the\ninsurer will be responsible for paying out funds, up to an amount equal to the\nlimits of liability of the policy, upon the direction of the commissioner, to\nsuch party or parties as the commissioner specifies. (v) An owner or operator or any other person\nauthorized to conduct post-closure care may request reimbursements for\npost-closure care expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the\ncommissioner. Within 60 days after receiving bills for post-closure care\nactivities, the commissioner will instruct the insurer to make reimbursements\nin such amounts as the commissioner specifies in writing, if the commissioner\ndetermines that the post-closure care expenditures are in accordance with the\napproved post-closure plan, or otherwise justified. If the commissioner does\nnot instruct the insurer to make such reimbursements, the commissioner will\nprovide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of\nreasons. (vi)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust maintain the policy in full force and effect until the commissioner\nconsents to termination of the policy by the owner or operator as specified in\nsubparagraph (xi) of this paragraph. Failure to pay the premium, without\nsubstitution of alternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision, will constitute a significant violation of these regulations, warranting such\nremedy as the commissioner deems necessary. Such violation will be deemed to\nbegin upon receipt by the commissioner of a notice of future cancellation, termination or failure to renew due to nonpayment of the premium, rather than\nupon the date of expiration. (vii)\n\nEach policy must contain a provision allowing assignment of the policy to a\nsuccessor owner or operator. Such assignment may be conditional upon consent of\nthe insurer, provided such consent is not unreasonably refused. (viii)\n\nThe policy must provide that the\ninsurer may not cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy except for\nfailure to pay the premium. The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a\nminimum, provide the insured with the option of renewal at the limits of\nliability of the expiring policy. If there is a failure to pay the premium, the\ninsurer may elect to cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy by sending\nnotice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or operator\nand the commissioner. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not\noccur, however, during the 120 days beginning with the date of receipt of the\nnotice by both the commissioner and the owner or operator, as evidenced by the\nreturn receipts. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not occur\nand the policy will remain in full force and effect in the event that on or\nbefore the date of expiration: (a) the\ncommissioner deems the facility abandoned; (b) the permit is terminated or revoked or a\nnew permit is denied; (c) closure\nis ordered by the commissioner or a United States district court or other court\nof competent jurisdiction; (d) the\nowner or operator is named as debtor in a voluntary or involuntary proceeding\nunder\n11 USC\nA (Bankruptcy); or\n(e) the premium due is paid. (ix)\n\nWhenever the current post-closure cost\nestimate increases to an amount greater than the limits of liability of the\npolicy during the operating life of the facility, the owner or operator, within\n60 days after the increase, must either cause the limits of liability to be\nincreased to an amount at least equal to the current post-closure cost estimate\nand submit evidence of such increase to the commissioner, or obtain other\nfinancial assurance as specified in this subdivision to cover the increase. Whenever the current post-closure cost estimate decreases during the operating\nlife of the facility, the limits of liability may be reduced to the amount of\nthe current post-closure cost estimate following written approval by the\ncommissioner. (x) Commencing on the\ndate that liability to make payments pursuant to the policy accrues, the\ninsurer will thereafter annually increase the limits of liability of the\npolicy. Such increase must be equivalent to the limits of liability of the\npolicy. less any payments made, multiplied by an amount equivalent to 85\npercent of the most recent investment rate or of the equivalent coupon-issue\nyield announced by the United States Treasury for 26-week treasury\nsecurities. (xi)\n\nThe commissioner\nwill give written consent to the owner or operator that the insurance policy\nmay be terminated when: (a) an owner or\noperator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this\nsubdivision; or\n(b) the\ncommissioner releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this\nsubdivision in accordance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nFinancial test and\nguarantee for post-closure care. (i) An owner\nor operator of a facility which is not a revenue-oriented facility may satisfy\nthe requirements of this subdivision by demonstrating that the owner or\noperator passes a financial test as specified in this paragraph. No\nrevenue-oriented facilities will be allowed to use this financial assurance\nmechanism. To pass this test, the owner or operator must meet the criteria of\neither clause (a) or (b) of this subparagraph: (a) The owner or operator must have: (1)\ntwo of the following three ratios: a\nratio of total liabilities to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of\nnet income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization to the total\nliabilities greater than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current\nliabilities greater than 1.5; (2)\nnet working capital and tangible net worth at least six times the sum of the\ncurrent closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and\nabandonment cost estimates; (3)\ntangible net worth of at least $10 million; and\n(4)\nassets in the United States amounting to\nat least 90 percent of the total assets or at least six times the sum of the\ncurrent closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current plugging and\nabandonment cost estimates. (b) The owner or operator must have: (1)\na current rating for their most recent\nbond issuance of AAA, AA, A or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's, or Aaa, Aa, A or Baa as issued by Moody's; (2)\ntangible net worth at least six times the\nsum of the current closure and post-closure estimates and the current plugging\nand abandonment costs; (3)\ntangible\nnet worth of at least $10 million; and\n(4)\nassets located in the United States\namounting to at least 90 percent of the total assets or at least six times the\nsum of the current closure and post-closure cost estimates and the current\nplugging and abandonment costs. (ii)\n\nThe phrases, \"current closure and\npost-closure cost estimates\" and \"current plugging and abandonment cost\nestimates,\" as used in subparagraph (I) of this paragraph refer to the cost\nestimates required to be shown in paragraph 1-4 of the letter from the owner's\nor operator's chief financial officer. (iii)\n\nTo demonstrate that he or she meets\nthis test, the owner or operator must submit the following items to the\ncommissioner: (a) a letter signed by the\nowner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in\nparagraph (j)(5) of this section; (b) a copy of the independent certified\npublic accountant's report on examination of the owner's or operator's\nfinancial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and\n(c) a special report from the owner's or\noperator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator, stating that: (1)\nthe accountant has compared\nthe data which the letter from the chief financial officer specifies as having\nbeen derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for\nthe latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements; and\n(2)\nin connection with that\nprocedure, no matters came to the accountant's attention which caused the\naccountant to believe that the specified data should be adjusted. (iv)\n\nAn owner or\noperator of a new facility must submit the items specified in subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph to the commissioner at least 60 days before the date on\nwhich hazardous waste is first received for disposal. (v) After the initial submission of items\nspecified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, the owner or operator must\nsend updated information to the commissioner within 90 days after the close of\neach succeeding fiscal year. This information must consist of all three items\nspecified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (vi)\n\nIf the owner or operator no longer meets\nthe requirements of subparagraph (I) of this paragraph, the owner or operator\nmust send notice to the commissioner of intent to establish alternate financial\nassurance as specified in this subdivision. The notice must be sent by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested, within 90 days after the end of the\nfiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or\noperator no longer meet the requirements. The owner or operator must provide\nthe alternate financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal\nyear. (vii)\n\nThe commissioner may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the\nrequirements of subparagraph (I) of this paragraph, require reports of\nfinancial condition at any time from the owner or operator in addition to those\nspecified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. If the commissioner finds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the owner or operator\nno longer meets the requirements of subparagraph (I) of this paragraph, the\nowner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in\nthis subdivision within 30 days after notification of such a finding. (viii)\n\nThe commissioner may disallow use of\nthis test on the basis of qualifications in the opinion expressed by the\nindependent certified public accountant in his or her report on examination of\nthe owner's or operator's financial statements (see clause [iii][b] of this\nparagraph). An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion will be cause for\ndisallowance. The commissioner will evaluate other qualifications on an\nindividual basis. The owner or operator must provide alternate financial\nassurance as specified in this subdivision within 30 days after notification of\nthe disallowance. (ix)\n\nDuring the\nperiod of post-closure care, the commissioner may approve a decrease in the\ncurrent post-closure cost estimate for which this test demonstrates financial\nassurance if the owner or operator demonstrates to the commissioner that the\namount of the cost exceeds the remaining cost of post-closure care. (x) The owner or operator is no longer\nrequired to submit the items specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph\nwhen: (a) an owner or operator substitutes\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision; or\n(b) the commissioner releases the owner or\noperator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (8)\nof this subdivision. (xi)\n\nAn owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility may meet the requirements of this\nsubdivision by obtaining a written guarantee, hereinafter referred to as\n\"guarantee.\" If the firm which is providing the guarantee does not meet the\ndefinition of revenue-oriented in this section or section\n373-3.8\nof this Part, it may\nprovide the guarantee on behalf of the owner or operator even if the owner or\noperator is a revenue-oriented facility. For a revene-oriented facility, the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator cannot be consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. The guarantor must be the direct or\nhigher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent\ncorporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm\nwith a substantial business relationship with the owner or operator. The\nguarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in subparagraphs\n(i) through (ix) of this paragraph and must comply with the terms of the\nguarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording\nspecified in paragraph (j)(6) of this section. A certified copy of the\nguarantee must accompany the items sent to the commissioner as specified in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. One of these items must be the letter\nfrom the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's parent\ncorporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, the letter\nmust describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the\nguarantor is a firm with a substantial business relationship with the owner or\noperator, this letter must describe this substantial business relationship and\nthe value received in consideration of the guarantee. The terms of the\nguarantee must provide that: (a) If the owner\nor operator fails to perform post-closure care of a facility covered by the\nguarantee in accordance with the post-closure plan and other permit\nrequirements whenever required to do so, the guarantor will do so or make\npayment as the commissioner shall direct, in writing. (b) The guarantee will remain in force unless\nthe guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail, return receipt\nrequested, to the owner or operator and to the commissioner. Cancellation may\nnot occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the\nnotice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the commissioner, as\nevidenced by the return receipts. (c) If the owner or operator fails to provide\nalternate financial assurance as specified in this subdivision and obtain the\nwritten approval of such alternate assurance from the commissioner within 90\ndays after receipt by both the owner or operator and the commissioner of a\nnotice of cancellation of the guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will\nprovide such financial assurance in the name of the owner or\noperator. (6)\n\nUse of multiple financial mechanisms. An owner or operator may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by establishing more than one financial\nmechanism per facility. These mechanisms are limited to trust funds, surety\nbonds, letters of credit, and insurance. The mechanisms must be as specified in\nparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4), respectively, of this subdivision, except\nthat it is the combination of mechanisms, rather than the single mechanism, which must provide financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the\ncurrent post-closure cost estimate. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund\nin combination with a surety bond or a letter of credit, the trust fund may be\nused as the standby trust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust\nfund, if required, may be established for two or more mechanisms. The\ncommissioner may use any or all of the mechanisms to provide for post-closure\ncare of the facility. (7)\n\nUse of a\nfinancial mechanism for multiple facilities. An owner or operator may use a\nfinancial assurance mechanism specified in this subdivision to meet the\nrequirements of this subdivision for more than one facility. Evidence of\nfinancial assurance submitted to the commissioner must include a list showing, for each facility, the EPA identification number, name, address and the amount\nof funds for post-closure care assured by the mechanism. The amount of funds\navailable through the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that\nwould be available if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained\nfor each facility. In directing funds available through the mechanism for\npost-closure care of any of the facilities covered by the mechanism, the\ncommissioner may direct only the amount of funds designated for that facility, unless the owner or operator agrees to the use of additional funds available\nunder the mechanism. (8)\n\nRelease of\nthe owner or operator from the requirements of this subdivision. Within 60 days\nafter receiving certifications from the owner or operator and an independent\nprofessional engineer registered in New York that the post-closure care period\nhas been completed for a hazardous waste disposal unit in accordance with the\napproved post-closure plan, the commissioner will notify the owner or operator\nin writing that the owner or operator is no longer required by this subdivision\nto maintain financial assurance for post-closure care of the unit unless the\ncommissioner has reason to believe that post-closure care has not been in\naccordance with the approved post-closure plan. The commissioner shall provide\nthe owner or operator of a detailed written statement of any such reason to\nbelieve that post-closure care has not been in accordance with the approved\npost-closure plan. (g) Use of a mechanism for financial assurance of both closure and\npost-closure care. An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements for\nfinancial assurance for both closure and post- closure care for one or more\nfacilities by using a trust fund, surety bond, letter of credit, insurance, financial test, or corporate guarantee that meets the specifications for the\nmechanism in both subdivisions (d) and (f) of this section. The amount of funds\navailable through the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that\nwould be available if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained\nfor financial assurance of closure and post-closure care. (h) Liability requirements. (1)\n\nCoverage for sudden accidental\noccurrences. An owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage or\ndisposal facility, or a group of such facilities, must demonstrate financial\nresponsibility for bodily injury and property damage to third parties caused by\nsudden accidental occurrences arising from operations of the facility or group\nof facilities. The owner or operator must have and maintain liability coverage\nfor sudden accidental occurrences in the amount of at least $1 million per\noccurrence with an annual aggregate of at least $2 million, exclusive of legal\ndefense costs. This liability coverage may be demonstrated as specified in\nsubparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this paragraph. (i) An owner or operator may demonstrate the\nrequired liability coverage by having liability insurance as specified in this\nsubparagraph. (a) Each insurance policy must\nbe amended by attachment of the Hazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement\nor evidenced by a Certificate of Liability Insurance. The wording of the\nendorsement must be identical to the wording specified in paragraph (j)(7) of\nthis section. The wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to\nthe wording specified in paragraph (j)(8). The owner or operator must submit a\nsigned duplicate original of the endorsement or certificate of insurance to the\ncommissioner. If requested by the commissioner, the owner or operator must\nprovide a signed duplicate original of the insurance policy. An owner or\noperator of a new facility must submit the signed duplicate original of the\n\nHazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement or the Certificate of Liability\n\nInsurance to the commissioner at least 60 days before the date on which\nhazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage or disposal. The\ninsurance must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous\nwaste. (b) Each insurance policy\nmust be issued by an insurer which, at a minimum, is licensed to transact the\nbusiness of insurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus\nlines insurer within New York State, by the Superintendent of the New York\n\nState Department of Financial Services. (ii)\n\nAn owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility may meet the requirements of this paragraph\nby passing a financial test or using the guarantee for liability coverage as\nspecified in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision. If the firm which is\nproviding the guarantee does not meet the definition of revenue-oriented in\nthis section or section\n373-3.8\nof this Part, it may\nprovide the guarantee on behalf of the owner or operator even if the owner of\noperator is a revenue-oriented facility. For a revenue-oriented facility, the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator cannot be consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. (iii)\n\nAn owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a letter of credit for liability\ncoverage as specified in paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nAn owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a surety bond for liability\ncoverage as specified in paragraph (9) of this subdivision. (v) An owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a trust fund for liability coverage\nas specified in paragraph (10) of this subdivision. (vi)\n\nAn owner or operator may demonstrate the\nrequired liability coverage through use of combinations of insurance, financial\ntest, guarantee, letter of credit, surety bond, and trust fund, except that the\nowner or operator may not combine a financial test covering part of the\nliability coverage requirement with a guarantee unless the financial statement\nof the owner or operator is not consolidated with the financial statement of\nthe guarantor. The amounts of coverage demonstrated must total at least the\nminimum amounts required by this paragraph. If the owner of operator\ndemonstrates the required coverage through the use of a combination of\nfinancial assurances under this paragraph, the owner or operator shall specify\nat least one such assurance as \"primary\" coverage and shall specify other\nassurances as \"excess\" coverage. An owner or operator of a revenue-oriented\nfacility may use all of the above- mentioned financial mechanisms except the\nfinancial test and/or guarantee. (vii)\n\nAn owner or operator shall notify the\ncommissioner in writing within 30 days whenever: (a) a claim results in a reduction in the\namount of financial assurance for liability coverage provided by a financial\ninstrument authorized in subparagraphs (1)(i) through (vi) of this\nsubdivision; (b) a certification of\nvalid claim for bodily injury or property damages caused by a sudden or\nnonsudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste\ntreatment, storage, or disposal facility is entered between the owner of\noperator and a third-party-claimant for liability coverage under subparagraphs\n(1)(i) through (vi) of this subdivision; or\n(c) a final court order establishing a\njudgment for bodily injury or property damage caused by a sudden or nonsuden\naccidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste\ntreatment, storage or disposal facility is issued against the owner or operator\nor an instrument that is providing financial assurance for liability coverage\nunder subparagraphs (1)(i) through (vi) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nCoverage for\nnonsudden accidental occurrences. An owner or operator of a surface\nimpoundment, landfill, land treatment facility, or disposal miscellaneous unit\nthat is used to manage hazardous waste, or a group of such facilities, must\ndemonstrate financial responsibility for bodily injury and property damage to\nthird parties caused by nonsudden accidental occurrences arising from\noperations of the facility or group of facilities. The owner or operator must\nhave and maintain liability coverage for nonsudden accidental occurrences in\nthe amount of at least $4.5 million per occurrence, with an annual aggregate of\nat least $9 million, exclusive of legal defense costs, for each separate\nfacility in New York State. An owner of operator who must meet the requirements\nof this paragraph may combine the required per occurrence coverage levels for\nsudden and nonsudden accidental occurrences into a single per- occurrence\nlevel, and combine the required annual aggregate coverage levels for sudden and\nnonsudden accidental occurrences into a single annual aggregate level. Owners\nor operators who combine coverage levels for sudden and nonsudden accidental\noccurrences must maintain liability coverage in the amount of at least $5.5\nmillion per occurrence and $11 million annual aggregate. This liability\ncoverage may be demonstrated as specified in subparagraph (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of this paragraph: (i) An\nowner or operator may demonstrate the required liability coverage by having\nliability insurance as specified in this subparagraph. (a) Each insurance policy must be amended by\nattachment of the Hazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement or evidenced\nby a Certificate of Liability Insurance. The wording of the endorsement must be\nidentical to the wording specified in paragraph (j)(7) of this section. The\nwording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the wording\nspecified in paragraph (j)(8). The owner or operator must submit a signed\nduplicate original of the endorsement or the certificate of insurance to the\ncommissioner. If requested by the commissioner, the owner or operator must\nprovide a signed duplicate original of the insurance policy. An owner or\noperator of a new facility must submit the signed duplicate original of the\n\nHazardous Waste Facility Liability Endorsement or the Certificate of Liability\n\nInsurance to the commissioner at least 60 days before the date on which\nhazardous waste is first received for treatment, storage or disposal. The\ninsurance must be effective before this initial receipt of hazardous\nwaste. (b) Each insurance policy\nmust be issued by an insurer which, at a minimum, is licensed to transact the\nbusiness of insurance, or authorized to provide insurance as an excess or\nsurplus lines insurer, within New York State, by superintendent of the New York\n\nState Insurance Department. (ii)\n\nAn owner or operator of a facility which\nis not a revenue-oriented facility may meet the requirements of this paragraph\nby passing a financial test or using the guarantee for liability coverage as\nspecified in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision. If the firm which is\nproviding the guarantee does not meet the definition of revenue-oriented in\nthis section or section\n373-3.8\nof this Part, it may\nprovide the guarantee on behalf of the owner or operator even if the owner or\noperator is a revenue-oriented facility. For a revenue-oriented facility, the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator cannot be consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. (iii)\n\nAn owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a letter of credit for liability\ncoverage as specified in paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nAn owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a surety bond for liability\ncoverage as specified in paragraph (9) of this subdivision. (v) An owner or operator may meet the\nrequirements of this paragraph by obtaining a trust fund for liability coverage\nas specified in paragraph (10) of this subdivision. (vi)\n\nAn owner or operator may demonstrate the\nrequired liability coverage through the use of combinations of insurance, financial test, guarantee, letter of credit, surety bond, and trust fund, except that the owner or operator may not combine a financial test covering\npart of the liability coverage requirement with a guarantee unless the\nfinancial statement of the owner or operator is not consolidated with the\nfinancial statement of the guarantor. The amounts of coverage demonstrated must\ntotal at least the minimum amount required by this paragraph. If the owner or\noperator demonstrates the required coverage through the use of a combination of\nfinancial assurances under this paragraph, the owner or operator shall specify\nat least one such assurance as \"primary\" coverage and shall specify other\nassurances as \"excess\" coverage. An owner or operator of a revenue-oriented\nfacility may use all of the above-mentioned financial mechanisms except the\nfinancial test and/or guarantee. (vii)\n\nAn owner or operator shall notify the\ncommissioner in writing within 30 days whenever: (a) a claim results in a reduction in the\namount of financial assurance for liability coverage provided by a financial\ninstrument authorized in subparagraphs (2)(i) through (vi) of this\nsubdivision; (b) a certification of\nvalid claim for bodily injury or property damages caused by a sudden or\nnonsudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste\ntreatment, storage, or disposal facility is entered between the owner or\noperator and third-party claimant for liability coverage under subparagraphs\n(2)(i) through (vi) of this subdivision; or\n(c) a final court order establishing a\njudgment for bodily injury or property damage caused by a sudden or nonsudden\naccidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste\ntreatment, storage, or disposal facility is issued against the owner or\noperator or an instrument that is providing financial assurance for liability\ncoverage under subparagraphs (2)(i) through (vi) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nRequest for\nvariance. If an owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the\ncommissioner that the levels of financial responsibility required by paragraph\n(1) or (2) of this subdivision are not consistent with the degree and duration\nof risk associated with treatment, storage or disposal at the facility or group\nof facilities, the owner or operator may obtain a variance from the\ncommissioner. The request for a variance must be submitted to the commissioner\nas part of the application under section\n373-1.5\n(a) of this\n\nPart for a facility that does not have a permit, or pursuant to the procedures\nfor permit modification under section\n373-1.7\nfor a facility that has a\npermit. If granted, the variance will take the form of an adjusted level of\nrequired liability coverage, such level to be based on the commissioner's\nassessment of the degree and duration of risk associated with ownership or\noperation of the facility or group of facilities. The commissioner may require\nan owner or operator who requests a variance to provide such technical and\nengineering information as is deemed necessary by the commissioner to determine\na level of financial responsibility other than that required by paragraph (1)\nor (2) of this subdivision. Any request for a variance for a permitted facility\nwill be treated as a request for a permit modification under section\n373-1.7. (4)\n\nAdjustments by the commissioner. If the\ncommissioner determines that the levels of financial responsibility required by\nparagraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision are not consistent with the degree and\nduration of risk associated with treatment, storage or disposal at the facility\nor group of facilities, the commissioner may adjust the level of financial\nresponsibility required under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision as may\nbe necessary to protect human health and the environment. This adjusted level\nwill be based on the commissioner's assessment of the degree and duration of\nrisk associated with the ownership or operation of the facility or group of\nfacilities. In addition, if the commissioner determines that there is a\nsignificant risk to human health and the environment from nonsudden accidental\noccurrences resulting from the operations of a facility that is not a surface\nimpoundment, landfill or land treatment facility, the commissioner may require\nthat an owner or operator of the facility comply with paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. An owner or operator must furnish to the commissioner, within a\nreasonable time, any information which the commissioner requests to determine\nwhether cause exists for such adjustments of level or type of coverage. Any\nadjustment of the level or type of coverage for a facility that has a permit\nwill be treated as a permit modification under section\n373-1.7\nof this Part. (5)\n\nPeriod of coverage. Within 60 days after\nreceiving certifications from the owner or operator and an independent\nprofessional engineer registered in New York that final closure has been\ncompleted in accordance with the approved closure plan, the commissioner will\nnotify the owner or operator in writing that the owner or operator is no longer\nrequired by this subdivision to maintain liability coverage for that facility, unless the commissioner has reason to believe that closure has not been in\naccordance with the approved closure plan. (6)\n\nFinancial test for liability coverage. An\nowner or operator of a facility which is not a revenue-oriented facility may\nsatisfy the requirements of this subdivision by demonstrating that the owner or\noperator passes a financial test as specified in this paragraph.
