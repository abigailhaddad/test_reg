Tit. 10 §§ 712-1.27 - Mechanical requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Boilers\nshall have the capacity to supply the normal requirements of all steam and hot\nwater systems and equipment. The number and arrangement of boilers shall be\nsuch that when one boiler breaks down or when routine maintenance requires that\none boiler be temporarily taken out of service, the capacity of the remaining\nboilers shall be sufficient to operate all systems. (b) Boiler feed pumps, condensate return\npumps, fuel oil pumps and heating circulating pumps shall be connected and\ninstalled to provide standby service when any pump breaks down. (c) Heating systems shall be capable of\nmaintaining all rooms other than operating, delivery, recovery, nursery, and\nintensive care rooms at a minimum temperature of 75° F. (d) Air conditioning systems shall be\nprovided, capable of maintaining temperature and relative humidity at or\nbetween the following ranges: Temperature (° F)  Relative Humidity (%)\n\nOperating Rooms       70 - 76            50 - 60\n\nRecovery Rooms        75                 50 - 60\n\nIntensive Care Rooms  75 - 80            30 - 60\n\nDelivery Rooms        71 - 75            50\n\nNurseries             75 - 80            30 - 60\n\nFilters for the above systems shall be provided with a\nminimum efficiency of 90 percent. (e) All air supplied to the operating and\ndelivery rooms and nurseries shall be delivered at or near the ceiling of the\narea served, and all air exhausted from the area shall be removed near floor\nlevel. (f) Gravity heating or\ncooling units such as radiators or convectors may not be used in operating, delivery, recovery, nursery, intensive care rooms or kitchens. (g) Patients' rooms shall have operable\nwindows, which can be used for ventilation. (h) Bathing rooms, soiled workrooms, soiled\nlinen rooms and janitors' closets shall have mechanical exhaust ventilation. A\nwall or window exhaust fan with back-draft louvers may be accepted. (i) Toilet rooms, bathrooms and physical\ntherapy rooms shall have mechanical exhaust. However, a wall or window exhaust\nfan with back-draft louvers, or operable windows, which can be used for\nventilation may also be accepted, as equivalents. (j) Kitchen areas shall have a mechanical\nventilating system with an equal supply and exhaust and a minimum of 10 air\nchanges per hour. If all outside air is used, a filter with at least 35 percent\nefficiency shall be installed in the system. Dishwashing areas shall have an\nexhaust system with a minimum of 10 air changes per hour. Supply air for the\ndishwashing area may be taken from the kitchen. All exhaust air shall be\ndischarged directly to the outdoors. (k) Supply air for central ventilation\nsystems for patient areas shall be provided with filters having an efficiency\nof 90 percent if air is recirculated, or 80 percent if all outdoor air is\nused. (l) An incinerator shall be\nprovided to treat biological, infectious, and pathological wastes, unless other\nmethods of treatment and disposal of such wastes are approved. Design and\nconstruction of incinerators and refuse chutes shall meet the requirements for\napproval of the Department of Environmental Conservation and comply with NFPA\n82, Standard on Incinerators and Waste and Linen Handling Systems and\n\nEquipment, as referenced in section\n711.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle.

(n) Water systems shall be\nprovided to supply water of sufficient pressure to operate all fixtures and\nequipment. (o) Vacuum breakers\nshall be installed on hose bibbs and on all fixtures to which hoses or tubing\ncan be attached such as laboratory and janitors' sinks, bedpan-flushing\nattachments and autopsy tables. (p) The hot water heating equipment shall have sufficient capacity to supply water\nat the temperatures and amounts indicated below. The water temperature is to be\ntaken at hot water point of use or inlet to processing equipment. Clinical  Dietary  Laundry\n\nGallons (per hour per bed)  6-1/4     4        4-1/2\n\nTemperature (° F)           110       120*     160**\n*Wash water and rinse water when used as the sanitizer\nis to be provided at the temperature required by the equipment manufacturer, and 170° F when manual methods are used. **Lower temperature is permitted if a controlled\nprogram of sanitizing has prior approval of the department. (q) Building sewers shall discharge into a\nmunicipal sewerage system. Where such a system is not available, an approved\nsewage treatment system shall be used. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n712-1.27\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
