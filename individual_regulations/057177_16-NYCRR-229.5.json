For every\ntesting station where a recording calorimeter is maintained and operated, a\ncontinuous record of the heating value of the distributed gas, as determined by\nthe recording calorimeter, shall be maintained and the corrected averaged\nheating value of the distributed gas shall be computed and recorded both daily\nand monthly from the continuous record, except that for each day that the\ncorrected maximum heating value exceeds the corrected minimum heating value by\ntwo or more percent of the latter, the corrected average, minimum and maximum\nheating value of the distributed gas shall be computed and recorded from the\ncontinuous record.
