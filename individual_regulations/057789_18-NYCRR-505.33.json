(1)\n\nPersonal emergency response services\nmean: (i) the provision and maintenance of\nelectronic communication equipment in the home of an individual which signals a\nmonitoring agency for help when activated by the individual, or after a period\nof time if a timer mechanism has not been reset; and\n(ii)\nthe continuous monitoring of such\nsignals by a trained operator and, in case of receipt of such signals, the\nimmediate notification of such emergency response organizations or persons, if\nnecessary, as the individual has previously specified. (2)\n\nElectronic communication equipment (PERS\nequipment) means equipment that electronically signals a monitoring agency for\nhelp via telephone lines. PERS equipment includes the following: (i) an emergency response activator, which is\na small electronic device that the PERS recipient presses or otherwise\nactivates to send a signal for help to the monitoring agency; and\n(ii)\nan emergency response communicator, which is an electronic unit connected to a PERS recipient's telephone line. The\nemergency response communicator accepts a signal for help from the emergency\nresponse activator and also has its own device to generate a signal for help. It sends the signal via telephone lines to the monitoring agency. (3)\n\nMonitoring agency means an\nagency that is capable of receiving signals for help from a recipient's PERS\nequipment 24 hours per day, seven days per week; determining whether an\nemergency exists; and notifying an emergency response organization or an\nemergency responder that the PERS recipient needs emergency help. (4)\n\nEmergency response organization means a\npolice department, a fire department, an ambulance service, a hospital, or\nother entity that the PERS recipient has designated to respond to specific\nsignals for help when notified by the monitoring agency or an emergency\nresponder.
