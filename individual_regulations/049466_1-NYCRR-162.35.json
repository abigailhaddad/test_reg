  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.35 - Tomato standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality tomatoes shall be of similar varietal\ncharacteristics, mature, not overripe or soft, clean, well-developed, well-formed, fairly smooth and free from decay, freezing injury, sunscald and\ndamage by any other cause. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nSimilar varietal\ncharacteristics means that the tomatoes are alike as to firmness of flesh and\nshade or color (for example, soft-fleshed, early maturing varieties are not\nmixed with firm fleshed, mid season or late varieties, or bright red varieties\nmixed with varieties having a purplish tinge.)\n(2)\n\nMature means that the tomato has reached\nthe stage of development which will insure a proper completion of the ripening\nprocess and that the contents of two or more seed cavities have developed a\njelly like consistency and the seeds are well developed. (3)\n\nSoft means that the tomato yields readily\nto slight pressure. (4)\n\nClean means\nthat the tomato is practically free from dirt or other foreign\nmaterial. (5)\n\nWell-developed means\nthat the tomatoes show normal growth. Tomatoes which are ridged and peaked at\nthe stem end, contain dry tissue, and usually contain open spaces below the\nlevel of the stem scar are not considered well developed. (6)\n\nWell-formed means that the tomato has the\ntypical shape for the variety. (7)\n\nFairly smooth means that the tomato is not conspicuously ridged or\nrough. (8)\n\nDamage: (i) Growth cracks (radiating from or\nconcentric to stem scar). When not well healed, more than 1/8 inch in depth, individual radial cracks more than 1/4inch in length, aggregate length of all\nradial cracks more than one inch measured from edge of stem scar. (ii)\n\nCuts and broken skins not shallow or not\nwell healed, or shallow, well healed cut more than 1/2 inch (13 mm) in length, or other shallow, well healed skin breaks aggregating more than a circle 3/8\ninch (10 mm) in diameter. (iii)\n\nPuffiness -- open space in one or more locules materially detracts from\nappearance of tomato cut through center at right angles to a line from stem to\nblossom end. (iv)\n\nCatfaces -- scars\nare rough or deep, channels are very deep or wide, channels extend into a\nlocule, or a fairly smooth catface aggregating more than a circle 1/2 inch (13\nmm) in diameter. (v) Scars (other\nthan catfaces) -- no depth and aggregating more than a circle 3/8 inch (10 mm)\nin diameter. (vi)\n\nHail -- deep, rough, not well healed and corked over, or fairly smooth, shallow hailmarks\naggregating more than a circle 3/8 inch (10 mm) in diameter. (vii)\n\nInsect injury -- materially detracts\nfrom the appearance or any insect is present in the fruit. (9)\n\nSerious damage: (i) Growth cracks (radiating from or\nconcentric to stem scar). When not well healed, more than 1/8 inch in depth, individual radial cracks more than 1/2inch in length, aggregate length of all\nradial cracks more than one inch measured from the edge of the stem\nscar. (ii)\n\nCuts and broken skins\nnot shallow or not well healed, or shallow, well healed cut more than 1/2 inch\n(13 mm) in length, or other shallow, well healed skin breaks aggregating more\nthan a circle 1/2 inch (13 mm) in diameter. (iii)\n\nPuffiness -- open space in one or more\nlocules seriously detracts from appearance of tomato cut through center at\nright angles to a line from stem to blossom end. (iv)\n\nCatfaces -- scars are rough or deep, channels are very deep or wide, channels extend into a locule, or a fairly\nsmooth catface aggregating more than a circle 3/4 inch (19 mm) in\ndiameter. (v) Scars (other than\ncatfaces) -- no depth and aggregating more than a circle 5/8 inch (16 mm) in\ndiameter. (vi)\n\nHail -- deep, rough, not well healed and corked over, or fairly smooth, shallow hailmarks\naggregating more than a circle 5/8 inch (16 mm) in diameter. (vii)\n\nInsect injury -- seriously detracts\nfrom the appearance or any insect is present in the fruit. (10)\n\nVery serious damage: (i) Growth cracks (radiating from or\nconcentric to stem scar). When not well healed, more than 3/16 inch in depth, more than 3/4 inch in length, aggregate length of all radial cracks more than 1\n1/2 inch measured from the edge of the stem scar. (ii)\n\nCuts and broken skins fresh or healed\nand extending through the tomato wall. (iii)\n\nPuffiness -- open space in two or more\nlocules very seriously detracts from appearance of tomato cut through center at\nright angles to a line from stem to blossom end. (iv)\n\nCatfaces -- channels extend into the\nlocule, wall has been weakened to the extent that slight pressure will cause a\ntomato to leak or a fairly smooth catface aggregating more than a circle one\ninch (25 mm) in diameter. (v) Scars\n(other than catfaces) -- no depth and aggregating more than a circle one inch\n(25 mm) in diameter. (vi)\n\nHail --\nfresh, very deep or fairly smooth, shallow hailmarks aggregating more than a\ncircle one inch (25 mm) in diameter. (vii)\n\nInsect injury -- very seriously\ndetracts from the appearance or any insect is present in the fruit. (c) Size. Minimum - Maximum\n\nSmall 2 4/32 to 2 9/32\n\nMedium 2 9/32 to 2 17/32\n\nLarge 2 17/32 to 2 28/32\n\nExtra Large 2 28/32 to 3 15/32\n(1)\n\nMinimum diameter shall be the largest\ndiameter of the tomato measured at right angles to a line from the stem end to\nthe blossom end. (2)\n\nMaximum\ndiameter shall be the smallest dimension of the tomato determined by passing\nthe tomato through a round opening in any position. (d) Color classification. (1)\n\nThe following terms may be used, when\nspecified in connection with the grade statement, in describing the color as an\nindication of the stage of ripeness of any lot of mature tomatoes of a red\nfleshed variety: (i) Green means that the\nsurface of the tomato is completely green in color. The shade of green color\nmay vary from light to dark. (ii)\n\nBreakers means that there is a definite break in color from green to\ntannish-yellow, pink or red on not more than 10 percent of the\nsurface. (iii)\n\nTurning means that\nmore than 10 percent but not more than 30 percent of the surface, in the\naggregate, shows a definite change in color from green to tannish-yellow, pink, red or a combination thereof. (iv)\n\nPink means that more than 30 percent but not more than 60 percent of the\nsurface, in the aggregate, shows pink or red color. (v) Light red means that more than 60 percent\nof the surface, in the aggregate, shows pinkish-red or red; provided, that not\nmore than 90 percent of the surface is red color. (vi)\n\nRed means that more than 90 percent of\nthe surface, in the aggregate, shows red color. (2)\n\nAny lot of tomatoes which does not meet\nthe requirements of any of the above color designations may be designated as\n\"Mixed Color.\"\n(3)\n\nTomato color\nstandards USDA Visual Aid TM-L-1 consists of a chart containing 12 color\nphotographs illustrating the color classification requirements, as set forth in\nthis section. This visual aid may be examined in the Fruit and Vegetable\n\nDivision, AMS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, South Building, Washington, DC\n20250; in any field office of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Inspection Service; or upon request of any authorized inspector of such service. Duplicates of this\nvisual aid may be purchased from The John Henry Company, P.O. Box 17099, Lansing, Michigan 48901. (e) Tolerances. (1)\n\nFor defects. Ten percent for tomatoes in\nany lot which fail to meet the requirements for this grade provided that not\nmore than 1/2 this amount, or five percent shall be allowed for defects causing\nserious damage including therein not more than two percent for defects causing\nvery serious damage and not more than one percent for tomatoes which are soft\nor affected by decay. (2)\n\nFor\noff-size. Ten percent for tomatoes which are smaller than the specified minimum\ndiameter, or larger than the specified maximum diameter. (3)\n\nFor off-color. Ten percent for tomatoes\nin any lot which fail to meet the color specified, included therein not more\nthan five percent for tomatoes which are green in color when any term other\nthan green is specified. (f) Application of tolerances. (1)\n\nFor packages which contain more than five\npounds and a tolerance of 10 percent or more is provided, individual packages\nshall have not more than 11/2 times the tolerance specified, and for a\ntolerance of less than 10 percent, individual packages shall have not more than\ndouble the tolerance specified, except that at least one defective, and one\noff-size specimen may be allowed in any package: provided, that the averages\nfor the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade. (2)\n\nFor packages which contain five pounds or\nless individual packages shall have not more than four times the tolerance\nspecified, except that at least one tomato which is soft or affected by decay\nand one off-size specimen may be permitted in any package: provided, that the\naverages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the\ngrade. (g) Packing. Tomatoes shall be packed in new 20 or 25 pound cartons or film wrapped tubes in\nnew master containers marked with the name and address of grower, packer or\nshipper, count or net weight, and size. (Size markings shall comply with the\nterminology as stated in these specifications. Numerical size designations such\nas 7 x 7, 6 x 7 or 5 x 6 shall not be permitted. The terminology and larger, affixed to any size designation also shall not be permitted.) Packages shall be\nsubject to approval by the Department of Agriculture and Markets. Package\napproval shall be based upon the ability of the package to maintain quality\nstandards and integrity of the product. (h) Markings.
