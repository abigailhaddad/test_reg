  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 361-3.4 - Fermentation facilities for source-separated organics\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Exempt facilities. The following facilities are exempt from this Subpart\nwhen operated in a manner that does not produce vectors, dust or odors that\nunreasonably impact neighbors of the facility, as determined by the department. The byproducts of fermentation must be used in a manner acceptable to the\ndepartment. (1)\nA fermentation\nfacility located at a site controlled by the waste generator, in accordance\nwith paragraph 360.14(b)(1) of this Title. (2)\nA fermentation facility that accepts no\nmore than 1,000 pounds or one cubic yard of SSO per week, whichever is greater, based on a monthly average. (b) Registered facilities. Facilities of the following types are subject to the\nregistration provision of section\n360.15\nof this Title unless\notherwise exempt. Each facility must comply with the criteria in section\n360.19\nof this Title and the\noperational criteria in subdivision (c) of this section. (1)\nA fermentation facility that accept less\nthan ten tons of SSO per day. The waste must not contain sanitary content. Incoming waste must be stored in a container or other enclosed device and odors\nmust be controlled. (c) Operating criteria for registered fermentation facilities. A registered facility must be operated in compliance\nwith section\n360.19\nof this Title and the\nfollowing conditions: (1)\n\nMaterial\naccepted cannot remain at the facility for more than 24 months. (2)\n\nThe byproducts of fermentation can be\nused as a soil amendment, for animal feed, or in another manner acceptable to\nthe department. Use of the byproduct as animal feed also requires a beneficial\nuse determination under Part 360 of this Title. (3)\n\nThe facility must be constructed to\nminimize any ponding, and run-off must be effectively controlled. (4)\n\nThe facility must be at least 200 feet\nfrom the nearest surface water body, potable water well and State-regulated\nwetland. (5)\n\nThe facility must be\nat least 200 feet from the nearest residence or place of business. This\nexclusion does not apply to the waste generating business or operator's\nresidence, or any residence or place of business built after the facility began\noperation. The buffer area can be reduced by the department if means (such as\nenclosed vessels, etc.) acceptable to the department are used to reduce the\npotential for odor transmission. (6)\n\nThe facility must keep written records of\nall materials entering and leaving the facility and the corresponding\ndates. (7)\n\nAll waste received must\nbe source-separated. Material received in its original packaging (for example, off-spec drinks) that will be depackaged prior to treatment is\nallowed. (8)\n\nThe facility must not\nproduce odors that unreasonably impact sensitive receptors, as determined by\nthe department. The department can require a reduction in the amount of waste\naccepted, or other actions, to address odor issues. (d) Permit application requirements\nA fermentation facility that does not qualify for an\nexemption or a registration under this Subpart must obtain a permit and must\nsubmit an application that includes the requirements identified in this\nsubdivision and section\n360.16\nof this Title. The\napplication must include the following: (1)\nA detailed description of the source, quality, and quantity of all SSO to be processed. The description must include\nthe annual input and any seasonal variations in the waste type and quantity, and the appropriate quality data, as determined by the department. (2)\n\nAn operation plan that includes: (i) a description of how the facility will\ncomply with the operating requirements in Part 360 of this Title and section\n361-3.4\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart; (ii)\na description and the\ncapacity of the storage structures and fermenter; (iii)\na description of all pre-processing and\npost-processing methods and equipment used to identify and remove all\nnonprocessible materials and a copy of all agreements or educational activities\nthat will be used to outline acceptable materials for the facility; (iv)\na description of the separation, processing, storage, and ultimate disposal location for nonprocessible\nmaterials; (v) a process flow\ndiagram of the entire process, including all major equipment and flow streams. The flow streams must indicate the quantity of material on a wet weight, dry\nweight, and volumetric basis; (vi)\nan outline of the processing duration, including the time period from\nacceptance of waste to completion of treatment and to distribution of the\nproduct and byproduct; (vii)\na\ndescription of the air emission collection and control equipment, if used; and\n(viii)\na description of the\nmethod used to control surface water run-off and to manage leachate, including\nthe method for treatment or disposal of leachate generated. For uncovered\nfacilities, calculations of the run-off and leachate that must be handled at\nthe facility, based on a rainfall intensity of one-hour duration and a ten-year\nreturn period. (3)\n\nFor\nfacilities that will use a low-permeability soil to minimize leachate release, a construction quality assurance/construction quality control plan as outlined\nin Part 363 of this Title. (4)\nA\ndescription of the ultimate use for the byproduct, including the approximate\nquantity of byproduct each type of user (such as residents, landscapers, and\nanimal feed markets) are expected to use, the frequency of distribution, the\nexpected use of the product, and the source of this information (such as\ncontract or phone survey). (5)\nA\ndescription of the method for removing byproduct from the facility. (6)\nA description of the proposed use or\ndisposal of byproduct that cannot be used in the expected manner due to poor\nquality or change in market conditions. (e) Design and operating requirements for\npermitted fermentation facilities. A fermentation facility required to obtain a permit must, in addition to the requirements identified in Part 360 of this Title, design, construct, maintain, and operate the facility in compliance with the following\ncriteria. (1)\n\nSite criteria\n(i) Stormwater must be diverted away from the\noperating area. (ii)\n\nAll leachate\nmust be collected and disposed in a manner approved by the department. All\nleachate storage facilities must be completely emptied, cleaned, and inspected\nevery 12 months. (iii)\n\nThe waste\nstorage area, processing area, leachate storage and liquid byproduct storage\narea at the facility must be in tanks or on surfaces that minimize leachate\nrelease into the groundwater under the facility and the surrounding land\nsurface, such as asphalt (except for leachate storage), concrete, or drying\nbeds that have underdrains for leachate collection. All leachate or liquid\ndigestate storage structures, other than tanks, must be designed in accordance\nwith Subpart 361-2 of this Part or NRCS code NY313 standards. The following\ncriteria also apply: (a) If a surface\nimpoundment is used for leachate or liquid byproduct storage, a minimum of two\nfeet of freeboard must be maintained. In addition, the bottom of the liner\nsystem must be a minimum of five feet above both seasonal high groundwater\nelevation and the top of bedrock. (b) Byproduct must be stored in a manner that\nwill minimize run-off. All run-off generated must be contained\non-site. (iv)\n\nFor\nuncovered processing facilities, the facility must be able to manage the\nquantity of leachate generated at the facility based on a rainfall intensity of\none-hour duration and a 10-year return period. (2)\n\nWaste acceptance and operations. (i) All incoming waste must be stored in a\ntank or under cover. (ii)\n\nThe\nfacility must be operated in a manner to control the generation and migration\nof odors to a level that is to be expected from a typical facility operated in\ncompliance with the regulatory criteria of this Subpart, as determined by the\ndepartment. (iii)\n\nThe minimum\nhorizontal separation distance as measured from the facility to the nearest\nresidence, place of business or public contact area (except turf farms and\nplant nurseries) is 200 feet. The following criteria also apply: (a) the separation distance requirement from\na public contact area can be reduced for totally enclosed facilities or other\nmitigating landscape features, if approved by the department; (b) the separation distance requirement\napplies at the time the permit application is submitted to the department. The\nfacility is not required to comply with the separation requirement with respect\nto construction of nearby residences, places of business or public contact\nareas after the permit application is submitted to the department; and\n(c) the separation distance\nrequirement for a residence does not apply to the residence of the facility\nlandowner or operator. For a municipal permittee, land owned by any agency or\ndepartment of the municipality is considered to be owned by the\nmunicipality. (iv)\n\nThe\nfacility can only accept food scraps from a generator that has a collection\nprogram designed to collect organic waste separate from other recyclables and\nwaste materials and to remove inorganic and nonprocessible materials from the\nfood scraps generated. This does not prohibit the facility from accepting\npackaged products if depackaging will occur at the facility. The facility must\nalso have provisions for inspection and removal of nonprocessible materials\nreceived. (v) Storage of the\nbyproduct at the facility must not exceed 24 months. (3)\n\nProduct quality and use. (i) Nonprocessible waste and unacceptable\nproduct must be disposed at least weekly, unless less than five cubic yards are\ngenerated per week. For amounts less than five cubic yards per week, the\nmaterial can be stored for up to one month, provided offensive odors are not\npresent. (ii)\nA byproduct that does\nnot meet the criteria in this section is considered a waste and must be\ndisposed. (iii)\n\nThe byproduct can\nbe distributed for uses approved by the department. (iv)\n\nThe byproduct must not contain pollutant\nlevels greater than those found in Table 6 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (v) The byproduct must not contain more than\n0.5 percent total physical contaminants greater than 4 millimeters by weight\n(dry weight basis), with no more than 20% consisting of film plastic. Physical\ncontaminants include human-made inert products including, but not limited to, glass metal, and plastic. (v) The\nbyproduct must be able to pass through a one-inch screen, except for wood\nparticles derived from the use of wood chips as a bulking agent or\namendment. (vi)\n\nIf distributed to\nthe public, the byproduct must be mature and must be used in a legitimate\nmanner as a soil amendment. (vii)\n\nUse of the byproduct as a soil amendment or animal feed is\nacceptable. (viii)\n\nUse of the\nprimary product (alcohol, etc.) requires an approved beneficial use\ndetermination under section\n360.12\nof this Title. (4)\n\nMonitoring requirements. (i) The department can require annual\nanalyses of the byproduct for maturity before distribution. This can include, but is not limited to, potential for reheating, organic matter reduction, plant\ngrowth impact, or oxygen consumption. (5)\n\nReporting requirements. (i) The annual report required by paragraph\n360.19(k)(3) of this Title, must include: (a) all information and analyses, (including copies of the laboratory sheets), required by this Subpart; (b) the\ntype and quantity of the food scraps being processed, including the source of\nthe material; (c) process\noperational information including monitoring data and significant facility\noperational problems and any actions taken to correct any problems; (d) the quantity, by weight and volume, of\nbyproduct generated at the facility and the quantity of byproduct removed from\nthe facility; and\n(e) a description\nof the byproduct distribution and disposal methods.
