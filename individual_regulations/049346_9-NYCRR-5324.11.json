(1)\n\nAll cards used to game at\nblackjack shall be dealt either from the dealer's hand or from a dealing shoe\nspecifically designed for such purpose. (2)\n\nThe dealer shall remove cards from the\nshoe with the dealer's left hand, turn the cards face up, and then place the\ncards on the appropriate area of the layout with the dealer's right hand, except that the dealer has the option to deal cards to the first two positions\nwith the dealer's left hand. (3)\n\nAfter each full set of cards is placed in the shoe, the dealer shall burn the\nfirst card from the shoe. Each new dealer who comes to the table shall also\nburn the first card from the shoe before the new dealer deals any cards to the\nplayers. The burn card shall be disclosed if requested by a player. (4)\n\nAt the commencement of each round of\nplay, the dealer shall, starting on the dealer's left and continuing around the\ntable, deal the cards in the following order: (i) one card face up to each box on the\nlayout in which a wager is contained; (ii)\none card to the dealer, which may be\ndealt face up or face down upon the initial deal. If dealt face down, such card\nshall be turned face up after all other cards have been dealt in accordance\nwith this paragraph; (iii)\na second\ncard face up to each box in which a wager is contained; and\n(iv)\none card face down to the dealer, which\nshall be known as the hole card. (5)\n\nIn addition to the requirements set forth\nin subdivision (c) of section\n5324.2\nof this Part, hand deals\nshall comply with this paragraph. (i) Prior\nto commencement of each round of play, the dealer shall burn the top card and\nthen, starting with the player farthest to the dealer's left and continuing\naround the table in a clockwise direction, deal the cards: (a) one card face down to each box on the\nlayout in which a blackjack wager has been placed; (b) one card face up to the dealer; (c) a second card face down to each box in\nwhich a wager has been placed; and\n(d) a second card face down to the\ndealer.

(iii)\n\nEach player, starting with the player farthest to the dealer's left and\ncontinuing around the table in a clockwise direction, shall then indicate\nwhether the player wishes to surrender, double down, split, stand or draw\nadditional cards. (iv)\n\nIf a player\nindicates that the player wishes to surrender, double down or split a pair\npursuant to section\n5324.10\nof this Part, the dealer\nshall turn over the player's two cards and complete the dealing procedures\npursuant to this subdivision.

(i) If the gaming\nfacility elects to use a card reader device, the dealer shall insert the hole\ncard into the card reader device by moving the card face down on the layout\nwithout exposing the card's value to anyone at the table, including the dealer.
