  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 459.6 - Multiple unit dwelling\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nutility shall not discontinue service to an entire multiple unit dwelling\n(defined as containing three or more individual dwelling units) where the\ncustomer to whom the last preceding bill has been rendered, or from whom or\nwhich the utility has received payment therefor, has failed to pay such\nelectric bills until 35 days have elapsed from the date payment was due. Additionally such termination cannot occur until the utility has complied with\nthe following procedures: (1)\n\nThe utility\nmust give 15 days' written notice of its intention to so discontinue by\npersonally serving such notice on the owner of the premises affected or on the\ncustomer to whom the last preceding bill was rendered, or from whom or which\nthe utility has received payment therefor, and on the superintendent or other\nperson in charge of the building, if it can be readily ascertained that there\nis such superintendent or other person in charge. (2)\n\nThe utility must give 15 days' written\nnotice by registered or certified letter to the owner or customer specified in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, if such notice is mailed to the address of\nsuch person(s), firm or corporation. (3)\n\nIn addition to the notice prescribed by\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, 15 days' written notice shall be\nposted in the public areas of such multiple dwelling; and 15 days' written\nnotice shall be mailed to the occupant of each unit in that multiple dwelling\nand to the local health officer and director of the social services district\nfor the political subdivision in which the multiple dwelling is located. Notice\nto health officers and directors of social services shall be repeated not more\nthan four working days nor less than two working days prior to such\ndiscontinuance. (4)\n\nWhenever a\nnotice of intention to discontinue electric service has been made pursuant to\nthe provisions of this section and obligations owed the utility have been\nsatisfied, the utility shall, in the same manner as it gave such notice of\nintention, notify the occupant of each unit that the intention to discontinue\nelectric service no longer exists. (b) Notwithstanding the provision of\nsubdivision (a) of this section, no utility shall discontinue services to a\nmultiple dwelling, where the owner or customer responsible for making payment\nfails to pay utility bills, as long as occupants of such multiple dwellings\ncontinue to make timely payments for such service. All notices referred to in\nsubdivision (a) of this section shall contain the intended date of\ndiscontinuance of service and the name and telephone number of a contact at the\nutility who will advise occupants of the amount due for electric service and\nwho will arrange meetings with occupants to attempt to work out a mechanism for\navoiding discontinuance of service in the event that the owner or customer\ncontinues to fail to make requisite payments or arrangements for such payments. The notice shall also refer to the provisions contained in subdivision (a) of\nsection 235 of the New York Real Property Law authorizing occupants to set-off, against their rent, payments to utilities in such circumstances. (c) A utility may not require occupants in a\nmultiple dwelling electing to make payments as detailed in subdivision (b) of\nthis section to pay more than the current electric charges incurred by the\nowner or customer, to whom or which the last preceding bill has been rendered\nor from whom or which the utility has received payment therefor. A current\ncharge for purposes of this section means the amount properly billed the owner\nor customer, for electricity used during the most recent billing period covered\nby the first bill rendered on or after the date when the disconnect notice is\nissued. The current charges will not include any arrears for earlier billing\nperiods that may appear on such a bill. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
