  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 5 § 102.3 - Approval of application\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nboard shall determine whether or not an applicant is or may become eligible to\nreceive credits under article 9-A, 9-B, 9-C, 23, 32 or 33 of the Tax Law, or\nexemptions under section\n485\nof\nthe Real Property Tax Law, or both. (b) The board shall not approve any\napplication which concerns the removal of a business facility from one area of\nthe State to another area of the State, or in the abandonment of one or more\nplants or facilities of the applicant within the State, unless the applicant\ndemonstrates to the satisfaction of the board, in a sworn written statement by\na corporate officer, partner or sole proprietor, that the proposed facility is: (1)\nreasonably necessary to discourage the\napplicant from removing such other facility to a location outside the State; or\n(2)\nreasonably necessary to\npreserve the competitive position of the applicant in its respective industry. An applicant may be deemed to meet the requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision if, in his submission to the board, he\ndemonstrates: (i) the feasibility of\nout-of-state relocation; and (ii) that such relocation would provide a\nsignificant reduction in production costs compared to production costs at the\nexisting location. An applicant may be deemed to meet the requirements of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision if, in his submission to the board, he\ndemonstrates that such relocation will be instrumental in halting at least\nthree consecutive years of declining profitability of its existing facility or\nin providing a significant reduction in operating or production costs. For\npurposes of this section, area shall mean county, except that in reference to\nthe city of New York, area shall mean the city of New York. (c) In deciding whether\nor not to grant credit for job retention, the board shall consider, among other\nthings: (1)\nthe size and nature of the new\ninvestment relative to the value of existing investment in New York\n\nState; (2)\nthe percentage of\nincrease of employment at the proposed business facility; (3)\nthe number of existing jobs that will be\nretained by reason of the new investment; and\n(4)\nthe feasibility of out-of-state\nrelocation. (d) If a\nbusiness concern does not seek State tax credits and/or real property tax\nexemptions within two years of the projected completion date of the project\nwhich has been proposed in the application and approved by the board, such\napproval shall lapse, unless extended at the discretion of the board upon the\nwritten request of the applicant. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to\nprohibit a firm from reapplying for approval of a project after the initial\napproval for the same project has lapsed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
