Community residences are\ndesigned to accomplish two major goals: (1)\nprovide a home environment; and\n(2)\nprovide a setting where persons can\nacquire the skills necessary to live as independently as possible. For the\npurpose of this regulation, the following types of community residences are\ndefined: (i) supervised community\nresidence\na facility with staff onsite or proximately available at all\ntimes when the persons are present; (ii)\nsupportive community\nresidence\na facility providing practice in independent living under\nvariable amounts of oversight delivered in accordance with the person's needs\nfor such supervision; (iii)\nindividualized residential alternative (IRA)\na facility\nproviding room, board and individualized protective oversight; (a) a\nsupervised IRA\nis a\nfacility that has staff onsite or proximately available at all times when the\npersons are present; and\n(b) a\nsupportive IRA\nis a facility that is providing practice in\nindependent living under variable amounts of oversight delivered in accordance\nwith the person's needs for such supervision, and staff typically are not\nonsite nor proximately available at all times when the persons are\npresent.

The funds are made available in accordance with section\n41.36\n(n) of the Mental Hygiene Law and payment is\nmade on a semiannual basis to the agency. (t) Governing body. The policymaking authority of a community residence\nresponsible for the overall operation and management of one or more community\nresidences operated by an agency.

The maximum monthly amount a person can be required to\ncontribute to the cost of care in a community residence. It is the Level II SSI\npayment amount minus the minimum personal allowance in section 131-o of the New\n\nYork State Social Services Law. (z) Person. For purposes of this Part, a child or adult with a diagnosis\nof developmental disability, who has been or is being served by a State, private or voluntary operated facility certified by OPWDD. For purposes of this\n\nPart, this shall include children or adults who have applied to or have been\nscreened for services and for whom a clinical record is maintained or possessed\nby such a facility. (aa)\n\nPerson, capable adult. For the purposes of this Part, a person 18 years of age or\nolder who is able to understand the nature and implication of various issues\nsuch as program planning, treatment or movement. The assessment of capability\nin relation to each issue as it arises will be made by the person's program\nplanning team. If the individual resides in a developmental center or is on\nconditional release, this shall be done with notice to the Mental Hygiene Legal\n\nService. Capability as stipulated by this definition does not mean legal\ncompetency; nor does it necessarily relate to a person's capacity to\nindependently handle his or her own financial affairs; nor does it relate to\nthe person's capacity to understand appropriate disclosures regarding proposed\nprofessional medical treatment, which must be evaluated independently. Thus, an\nindividual may be capable of participation in planning for his/her services and\nprograms but still require assistance in the management of financial matters. Whenever there is doubt on the part of any other party interested in the\nwelfare of the individual as to that person's ability to make decisions, as\nascertained by the program planning team, a determination of capability is to\nbe made by an external capability review board, designated by the commissioner. A capable adult person cannot override the authority of a guardian appointed in\naccordance with the Surrogate's Court Procedure Act, or of a conservator, or of\na committee. (ab)\n\nPlan, individualized service (ISP). The written document that is developed by an individual's\nchosen service coordinator, the individual and/or the parties chosen by the\nindividual, often known as the person's circle of support, that describes the\nservices, activities and supports, regardless of the funding source, and that\nconstitutes the person's individualized service environment. This document may\nbe known by a different name but it must comprise the elements described in\nthis definition. The goal of the ISP is to ensure the provision of those things\nnecessary to sustain the person in his/her chosen environment and preclude\nmovement to an ICF/DD. These services, activities and supports, identified in\nthe ISP, are to reflect the preferences, capabilities, and capacities of the\nperson and emphasize the development of self-determination\n(\ni.e., making personal choices), independence, productivity, and integration into the community. The ISP identified by personal descriptive\nand identification information, contains at a minimum: (1)\nassessment information and\nrecommendations; (2)\nan\nidentification of each service, service provider (including type), the amount, frequency, and duration of each service, and effective dates for service\ndelivery; (3)\nan identification of\nthe individual's personal goals, preferences, capabilities, and capacities\nwhich are then related to habilitation or support needs stated in terms of\noutcomes to be achieved within specified timeframes; and\n(4)\nservice coordination, including\nassessment, service planning and coordination, linkage and referral, follow-up\nand monitoring. It is the responsibility of the individual's chosen service\ncoordinator to ensure that the ISP is reviewed at least semi-annually and\nincludes consideration of the information obtained from other-than-OPWDD\nproviders (if any), who are providing services (\ne.g., as\nappropriate, the individualized plan for employment [IPE] or the individualized\neducation plan [IEP]). The service coordinator should also ensure that a review\nof the ISP occurs when the individual and/or parties chosen by the individual\nrequest it; or when the capabilities, capacities or preferences of the\nindividual have changed and warrant a review; or when it is determined by the\nservice coordinator that the prevailing plan (or portions of the plan) is/are\nineffective. If habilitation services are provided (\ni.e., residential habilitation, day habilitation, community habilitation, supported\nemployment, pre-vocational services, pathway to employment), the relevant\nhabilitation plan(s) must be developed, and on a semiannual basis thereafter, reviewed and revised as necessary by the habilitation service provider. The ISP\nshall include or contain as attachments the following: (1)\nall relevant habilitation plans (for\nindividuals receiving habilitation services); (2)\nall relevant plans or documents pursuant\nto subdivisions\n636-1.4\n(c) and\n(d) of this Title that support modification\nto an individual's rights specified in paragraphs 636-1.4(b)(1)-(4) of this\n\nTitle; and\n(3)\nthe individual plan\nfor protective oversight for residents of an individualized residential\nalternative (IRA) (see section\n686.16\n[a][6]\nof\nthis Title). The ISP is equivalent to a clinical record for the purposes\nof confidentiality and access. (ac)\n\nPolicies/procedures or\npolicy/procedure. As used in this Part, the term indicating the need for\nappropriate written guidance for staff, whether such guidance is in the form of\na policy statement, a policy statement with accompanying procedures, or\nprocedures only. Determination of the nature of the material is that of the\nagency/facility. (ad)\n\nPrinciples of compliance. Those requirements with which an agency must comply, but\nagainst which the facility will not be routinely surveyed for recertification\npurposes. However, evidence of failure to comply with the principles may be the\nbasis for decertification in accordance with article 16 of the Mental Hygiene\n\nLaw. (ae)\n\nPrompts. An intermittent urge to action whether physical or verbal, and not a means of continuous assistance. Physical prompts\nmeans bodily contact of instantaneous duration. Thus, the necessity for staff\nto literally push or pull a person to initiate or continue appropriate\nevacuation procedures goes beyond a physical contact of instantaneous duration\nand is therefore not allowed as a \"physical prompt\". In no event may the act of\nassisting an individual in getting out of bed, getting out of a seat, getting\nup off the floor, or in actual ambulation be considered as a \"physical prompt\". That is, lifting and/or carrying are prohibited. (af)\n\nResidence, community. See community residence. (ag)\n\nRespite. The provision of intermittent, temporary, substitute care of\na person with developmental disabilities on behalf of a primary caregiver. It\nis a means of providing relief from the responsibilities of daily\ncaregiving. (ah)\n\nStandards of certification. Those criteria which specify the basis of documenting\ncompliance for the purposes of issuing an operating certificate. The basis of\ndocumentation may include facility specific record; specified forms or reports; specified contents of records, reports or forms; and/or other means of\nassessing compliance such as interviews with individuals, employees or\nvolunteers, and/or onsite observation of activities and the environment. (ai)\n\nStatus, non-resident. A designation for those persons (such as an individual's\nspouse, children or other family members) residing at the certified supportive\ncommunity residence, and who have not been admitted to the supportive community\nresidence. (aj)\n\nStatus, transitional. A designation for individuals in a supportive community\nresidence who have attained independent living skills but who remain in the\nfacility while they demonstrate their proficiency in these skills and/or make\nprovisions for moving to independent living. (ak)\n\nVerification. Any means, including but not limited to observation, interview, and the written word, that provides a basis for being reasonably\nassured that a requirement has been met.
