  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4111.9 - Preference\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Preference\nshall be given in all overnight purse races according to a horse's last\nprevious purse race during the current year, but a horse of the classification\noffered shall in all events be preferred over horses of slower classification. The preference date on a horse that has been drawn to a race and been scratched\nis the date of the race from which the horse was scratched. In order to insure\nproper diversification of racing fields in classes having less than 25 horses\navailable for competition, the racing secretary may consider two consecutive\nrace dates in the class of equal preference. (b) When a horse is declared to race for the\nfirst time in any year, the date of its prerequisite qualifying race, if any, or otherwise of its first such declaration shall be considered its last race\ndate and preference shall be applied accordingly. (c) A horse that has last raced at a fair\nmeeting shall carry the preference date of such fair race. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4111.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
