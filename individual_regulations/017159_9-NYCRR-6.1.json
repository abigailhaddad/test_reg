  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6.1 - Executive order no. 1: establishment of ethical conduct guidelines\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, government employment is a privilege rather than a\nright, and is based upon the trust and confidence placed in the State's workers\nby the public; and\nWHEREAS, all State employees therefore must act in a manner\nconsistent with that public trust, and must not take any actions that are\nintended, or appear to be intended, to achieve personal gain or benefit; and\nWHEREAS, employees and officers of State agencies and\npublic authorities are subject to certain ethical statutes and rules, including\nbut not limited to the State Code of Ethics (Section\n74\nof the\n\nPublic Officers Law), statutory restrictions on business and professional\nactivities (Section\n73\nof the\n\nPublic Officers Law), and opinions issued by the State Ethics Commission; and\nWHEREAS, there are some areas where New York's existing\nstatutes governing ethical standards can and should be improved; and\nWHEREAS, until that occurs through legislative action, it\nis appropriate to take steps to ensure that as many State employees and\nofficers as possible maintain the highest ethical and professional\nstandards; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Eliot Spitzer, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1.

State vehicles shall\nbe used for official business or incidental use associated with official\nbusiness away from an employee's official work station. Individuals who are\nauthorized by their agency or public authority to use a vehicle for personal\npurposes shall keep records of such use, and the value of such personal use\nshall be calculated and reported as personal income to such individual for tax\npurposes. 5. Prohibition\n\nAgainst Nepotism in Hiring and Contracting\na. No individual covered by this order may take part in any hiring or employment\ndecision relating to a family member.
