(2)\n\nAn amendment must include a representation that\nall material changes of facts or circumstances affecting the property or the offering are included, unless the changes were described in prior\namendment(s) submitted to but not yet filed with the Department of Law.

An offering plan that has been amended extensively may be rewritten to incorporate the amendments into the body of the\nplan, and must be rewritten if required by the Department of Law.

(7)\n\nFor the purposes of this section, substantial amendment shall include, but not be limited to: an increase or\ndecrease in the mortgage amount or cash purchase price, an increase or decrease in the working capital or reserve fund, agreement by the sponsor to\nmake additional repairs or improvements, or to repurchase apartments, or the offer of new or better terms for financing the purchase price of an\napartment. (8)\n\nAmendments must be served on offerees in accordance with section\n18.1\n(d) of this Part, unless\nthe Department of Law consents to service on a specified class or classes of offerees. (b) Procedure for submission of amendments. Amendments must be mailed to or submitted during business hours to the\n\nNew York State Department of Law, Real Estate Finance Bureau, 28 Liberty Street, New York, NY 10005. Include the following when submitting an\namendment to the Department of Law: (1)\nA transmittal letter, signed by the attorney who prepared the\namendment, that: (i) states the date the offering plan was filed and the Department of Law file number; (ii)\nidentifies the subject amendment in numerical order; (iii)\nstates\nwhether prior amendments had been submitted to but not yet filed with the Department of Law; and\n(iv)\nidentifies, if possible, the attorney in the Department of Law who reviewed the most recent submission; and\n(v) gives the current status of the offering plan: (a) identifies it as either an\neviction or a noneviction plan; and\n(b) states whether or not the plan has been declared effective or if\nthe closing has occurred; and\n(c) states if there are any outstanding exclusive purchase periods or\nrescission periods; (vi)\nnotes if there is currently an investigation pending by the\n\nDepartment of Law of the sponsor, a principal of sponsor, or the property to be owned by the apartment corporation; and\n(vii)\nstates the date on which sponsor submitted a digital copy of the offering plan and all previously filed\namendments to the Department of Law or whether this is the first time sponsor is submitting a digital copy of the offering plan and previously filed\namendments, if any.

(4)\n\nOne digital copy of the offering plan, including all previously filed amendments, if not already submitted to\nthe Department of Law. (5)\n\nOne form RS-2. If the amendment is submitted before the closing, or if the\namendment discloses the events that took place at the closing, the form must be signed by the sponsor. If the amendment is submitted after the\nclosing, the form must be signed by one or more holders of unsold shares, and must include the sponsor or principals of sponsor if the sponsor or\nprincipals are holders of unsold shares. (c) Amendments extending term of offering\nplan. Pursuant to section\n18.3\n(a)(9)\nof this Part, the\nterm of the initial offer is 12 months, commencing on the date indicated in the letter issued by the Department of Law stating that the plan is\nfiled. Prior to the filing of a post-closing amendment pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, an amendment other than a price change amendment\nextends the term of the offering for an additional six-month term from the date of filing of the amendment, unless the term is shorter under G.B.L. section 352-eee or 352-eeee which limits the aggregate offering period prior to effectiveness, or by the provisions of the amendment. After the\npost-closing amendment is filed pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, any subsequent amendment other than a price change amendment extends the\nterm of the offering for an additional 12-month term from the date of filing of the amendment. A price change amendment submitted pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of this section does not extend the term of the offering. In the absence of any amendments, an extension of the term must be made by\namendment before the end of the then current term and must comply with the provisions of this section and the requirements set forth below. (1)\n\nThe amendment must disclose all material changes such as decreases or increases in maintenance charges or a\nmaterial increase in an expense such as labor, utilities and real estate taxes. (2)\n\nIf the closing has\noccurred, the amendment: (i) must state the number of unsold shares remaining and identify the appurtenant dwelling\nunits; and\n(ii)\nmust state the extent to which the sponsor controls the board of directors. If the\nsponsor is still in control, state the requirements of the offering plan regarding the relinquishment of control. If the sponsor has relinquished\ncontrol, state the date when control was relinquished. (3)\n\nFor all offering plans in which the\nsponsor or holder(s) of unsold shares owns in the aggregate more than 10 percent of the shares, the amendment must disclose: (i) The aggregate monthly maintenance payments for the units appurtenant to the unsold shares; (ii)\n\nThe aggregate of the monthly rents currently payable from tenants of units appurtenant to unsold shares, or a\nreasonable approximation thereof. A current rent roll (as of a date within 60 days prior to submission) must be submitted with the amendment as a\nback-up document; (iii)\n\nFinancial obligations to the cooperative which will become due within 12 months\nfrom the date of the amendment (other than payment of maintenance) including, but not limited to, reserve and working capital fund payments and\npayments for repair and improvement obligations; (iv)\nA list of all unsold shares which have been pledged\nas collateral for loan(s) or otherwise represent security for financing arrangements; the identity and address of the lender(s); the maturity date of\nthe loan(s); and payment obligations under the loan(s), stated on a monthly basis where possible; (v) The\nmeans by which any payments or obligations set forth pursuant to subparagraphs (i), (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph will be funded. If the funding\nsource is stated as income from protected sales, disclose other sources of funding, if any, that will be utilized if such projected sales are not\nmade; (vi)\nA statement as to whether the sponsor or holder(s) of unsold shares is current on all\nfinancial obligations to the cooperative, including, but not limited to, payment of maintenance, reserve or working capital fund payments, assessments, and payments for repairs or improvements promised in the offering plan. In addition, state whether the sponsor or holder(s) of unsold\nshares is current on payments of underlying mortgages and all obligations under financing arrangements for which unsold shares have been pledged as\ncollateral. If the sponsor or holder(s) of unsold shares is not current on its obligations, state the date and amount of each delinquency and discuss\nthe effect of such delinquency on the cooperative. Also state whether the sponsor or holder(s) of unsold shares was current on all such obligations\n(\ni.e., had satisfied the obligation by the expiration of any grace period) during the 12 months prior to the filing of the\namendment, and if not, state the details of any delinquency; (vii)\nA list of all other cooperatives, condominiums and homeowners associations, by the Department of Law file number and address, in which the sponsor, general partner or principal of the\nsponsor, or holder(s) of unsold shares, as an individual or as general partner or principal of the sponsor or holder, owns more than 10 percent of\nthe shares or units. Disclose that offering plans for these buildings are on file with the Department of Law and are available for public\ninspection; (viii)\nA statement as to whether the sponsor and all principals of the sponsor, and all\nholders of unsold shares, as individuals, general partners or principals of the sponsor or holder, are current in all obligations set forth in\nsubparagraph (vi) of this paragraph in other cooperatives, condominiums and homeowners associations in which they own more than 10 percent of the\nunits as individuals, general partners or principals. If not current, state the identity of the property and the date and amount of each delinquency, together with any additional relevant facts. (ix)\n\nIf the sponsor or holder(s) of unsold shares own in the\naggregate 49 percent or more of the shares, the percentage of such ownership and the consequences on the ability of purchasers to obtain\ninstitutional financing for their purchase and on any future resale of their apartment. The following model language may be used: Certain banks and other institutional lenders are imposing various\nrestrictions on extending loans for the purchase of shares and units in cooperatives in which unsold shares constitute 49 percent or more of the\ntotal share and/or units. Such restrictions include requiring that a certain percentage of shares/units, usually 51 percent or more, be sold to\nowner-occupants before a lender will consider making a loan, regardless of the purchaser's credit worthiness. Thus, a purchaser may experience\ndifficulty obtaining a loan in a building where the percentage of shares/units held by the sponsor or holders is 49 percent or greater. It may also\nbe difficult for a purchaser to resell a unit if prospective purchasers are unable to obtain a loan because of the same minimum sales and occupancy\nrequirements. (4)\n\nAn offering plan must be amended immediately if any delinquency\nrequired to be disclosed by subparagraph (3)(vi) or (viii) of this subdivision has existed for 15 days, or if there has been a material change in the\nfinancial position of the sponsor or holder of unsold shares which may jeopardize its ability to meet its obligations to the cooperative. (d) Price change amendments. Any amendment proposing to change any offering price is subject to the\nrequirements set forth below and must be consistent with section\n18.3\n(h) of this Part. (1)\n\nNotwithstanding\nparagraph (a)(3) of this section, if the amendment is limited solely to price changes and no prior amendment has been submitted to but not yet filed\nwith the Department of Law, the amendment shall be deemed filed when submitted to the Department of Law. (2)\n\nIf the amendment contains price changes and supplements or amends any other part of the offering plan, the\namendment shall be filed on the date indicated in the letter issued by the Department of Law stating that the amendment has been filed, and not\nsooner. (3)\n\nThe transmittal letter for a price change amendment must be accompanied by a completed copy\nof form C-11 as promulgated by the Department of Law. (e) Amendment declaring a plan\neffective. (1)\n\nThe amendment to declare a plan effective must conform to the effective date section of the\noffering plan. If the plan was declared effective by notice, the amendment must refer to the notice and the date of the notice. No closing shall be\nheld until this amendment is accepted for filing by the Department of Law. (2)\n\nIf the plan is presented\npursuant to any law that requires that a specific percentage of bona fide tenants in occupancy subscribe before the plan may be declared effective, the amendment must state the percentage of bona fide tenants in occupancy who have subscribed and are being counted for purposes of declaring the\nplan effective. The amendment must also state how such percentage was calculated, including the number of units in the base, the number of tenants or\nunits subtracted from the base, the basis in law for the subtractions, and the names of tenants subtracted from the base and their apartment\nnumbers. (3)\n\nIf the plan is not presented pursuant to a law that requires that a specific percentage of\ntenants subscribe before the plan may be declared effective (including noneviction plans pursuant to G.B.L. section 352-eeee) the amendment shall\nstate: (i) the percentage of units being offered for which the sponsor or apartment corporation has accepted\nsubscription agreements; (ii)\nthe number of subscriptions from bona fide tenants in occupancy; and\n(iii)\nthe number of subscriptions from bona fide purchasers who represent that they intend that they\nor one or more members of their immediate family occupy the dwelling unit when it becomes vacant.
