The municipality and its lessees and\nsuccessors in title are prohibited from challenging the imposition or\ncontinuance of such controls, and failure to implement the department-approved\nplan or to maintain such controls constitute a violation of the State\nassistance contract and for the duration of such failure, the liability\nprotections and benefits set forth in ECL 56-0509 will have no force and\neffect; (v) the department will\nhave access to the site, at times appropriate to the circumstances and subject\nto the site health and safety plan, for purposes of ensuring that: (a) the site is investigated or remediated in\naccordance with the department-approved plans for the remedial investigation or\nremediation; (b) the site\nmanagement plan, where necessary for the remedy, including the operation, maintenance, and monitoring requirements identified in section 375- 4.8(e)(8)\nof this Subpart is being implemented satisfactorily; (c) the engineering and/or institutional\ncontrols, where necessary for the remedy, identified in section\n375-4.8\n(e)(8)\nof\nthis Subpart are continually maintained in the manner the department may\nrequire; and\n(d) the department may\ncarry out any measures necessary to return the site to a condition sufficiently\nprotective of public health, in accordance with ECL 56-0509(4); (vi)\nneither the municipality nor\nany of its lessees or successors in title shall interfere with such access; and\n(vii)\nthe municipality must\nmake this binding commitment by means of an environmental easement and/or lease\nprovisions, which provide that the department (in addition to the municipality)\nmay enforce the environmental easement and/or lease provisions, and that the\nmunicipality shall record an environmental easement in accordance with the\nrequirements of ECL article 71, title 36 within 45 days of the receipt of\nnotice from the department that the environmental easement must be\nrecorded.
