Tit. 7 § 220.9 - Sanctions for use of drugs /intoxicants\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A urine sample will be obtained from a\nparticipating Incarcerated Individual at the following times: (1)\nbetween two to ten days prior to a N FRP\nvisit; (2)\nimmediately prior to a N\nFRP visit; and\n(3)\nimmediately\nafter a N FRP visit. (i) Urinalysis samples\ntaken at points (1) and (3) will be tested at their respective draw times or\nshortly thereafter; the sample drawn at point (2) may be analyzed immediately\nor if the Incarcerated Individual tests positive at point (3). (b) If the Incarcerated\n\nIndividual tests positive for drugs or intoxicants at point (1), the FRP visit\nwill be cancelled. Security will inform the FRP ORC, who will be responsible\nfor advising the incarcerated individual's family of the cancellation. If the\n\nIncarcerated Individual is found guilty at the time of the disciplinary\nhearing, he or she, in addition to being subject to penalties under the\n\nStandards of Inmate Behavior, 7 NYCRR Chapter V, will also be suspended from\nthe FRP for one year. As a condition of reapplication, the Incarcerated\n\nIndividual must have completed the ASAT program or equivalent in the interim, and must present documentation of same at the time of reapplication. If the\n\nIncarcerated Individual is found not guilty, the FRP visit will be rescheduled\nfor a date that is acceptable to both the family and the facility. (c) If the Incarcerated Individual tests\nnegative at point (1) and positive at point (3), the urine sample taken at\npoint (2) will be tested to determine if the incarcerated individual ingested\ndrugs between points (1) and (2). If the (2) sample is positive, the family\ncannot be implicated. However, if the (2) sample is negative, it can be\nconcluded that the drugs were ingested during the Family Reunion visit, this\nimplicates the visitor(s). In this situation, the Incarcerated Individual will\nbe subject to the sanctions outlined in subdivision (b) of this section; additionally, the visitor(s) will be ineligible for participation in the FRP\nfor a minimum of two years. Once the visitor completes the two-year period of\nineligibility, a FRP application can be submitted, if the incarcerated\nindividual meets the basic eligibility standards. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
