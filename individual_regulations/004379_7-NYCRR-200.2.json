  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 200.2 - Search\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All persons\nentering a correctional facility are subject to search as a condition of\nentering a facility. All visitors, except for visitors to a correctional camp, shall pass through a walk through metal detector and/or be scanned with a hand\nscanner. Any visitor who exercises his or her option to refuse to comply with\nthe required search procedures shall not be permitted to enter a correctional\nfacility. Facility employees may be subject to search if, and when, required by\nthe superintendent or his or her designee. Note: The superintendent may make exceptions to the search\nrequirements for department officials or other dignitaries. (b) Notices will be posted at public\nentrances to a facility, in English and Spanish, providing that all visitors\nare subject to search as a condition of visitation. (c) A detailed definition of contraband (see\nsection\n200.3\nof this Part) shall be posted in the visitor processing area and made available\nto a visitor upon request. (d) Metal detectors. (1)\n\nCalibration and testing. All hand scanners and metal detectors shall be calibrated to meet the criteria\nestablished and approved by the deputy commissioner for correctional\nfacilities. (2)\n\nMetal detector\nsearches. (i) Each visitor shall remove all\nmetal items from clothing prior to monitoring. Jewelry (e.g., watches, chains, medals, etc.) which is normally concealed and which register an alarm will be\nremoved. Other jewelry (e.g., rings, pins, earring, etc.) which is normally not\nconcealed and which can be located by hand scanner, need not be\nremoved. (ii)\n\nItems that are\nremoved from visitors passing through the detector will be placed in a\ncontainer out of reach of the visitor where the items can be observed and\nchecked by staff. (iii)\n\nStaff shall\nthoroughly search handbags, briefcases, and other containers. Inspection of\nhandbags, briefcases, and other containers in the possession of an attorney or\nduly approved legal representative prior to an approved legal visit shall be\nlimited to cursory examination for contraband. Written materials shall be\ninspected, as unobtrusively as possible, to verify that the materials do not\ncontain contraband. (iv)\n\nStaff\nshall check and approve all items before returning them to the visitor and the\nitems will be returned only after the visitor has successfully passed through\nthe metal detector. (v) If there is\nany difficulty clearing a person by use of the walk-through metal detector, staff shall use the hand scanner to locate the problem area. Note: If items such as belt buckles, jewelry, metal buttons, etc. are probable causes of registering an alarm, the use of the hand scanner\nwill usually identify the object in question. The hand scanner should be held\napproximately 1/2 inch away from the area being searched. Care should be taken\nby staff to ensure that the hand scanner does not make physical contact with\nthe individual being processed. When the hand scanner indicates the presence of\nmetal, which is concealed under clothing, the visitor shall reveal (if\nappropriate) the object in question thereby establishing that the item revealed\ncaused the alarm or, if necessary, the visitor shall remove the item for\ninspection. (vi)\n\nIf, prior\nto an approved legal visit, an attorney or duly approved legal representative\nis unable to clear the metal detection process, staff shall contact the\nsuperintendent or designee for further direction. (3)\n\nIf the visitor is unable to reveal or\nremove the detected object due to its personal nature, processing shall\ncontinue as follows: The visitor shall be provided with a document explaining\nthat they have the right to leave the facility or they can pursue one of two\nsearch options: (i) A limited visual search\nto be conducted in a private area where an officer or staff member of the same\nsex will visually inspect the area in question by having the visitor lift any\narticles of clothing or under garments to satisfy staff that no contraband is\nsecreted on the visitor's person in the area in question. Should a staff member\nof the same sex not be available, a personal item search as set forth in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph shall be utilized. Note: When the limited visual search procedure is utilized, staff must obtain a signed \"Notice of Consent to Search\" form from the visitor\nand an unusual incident report must be filed in accordance with departmental\ndirective No. 4004, \"Unusual Incident Report.\"\n(ii)\nA personal item search may be conducted\nas an alternative to a limited visual search. (a) The visitor shall be provided a private\narea or other room that provides personal privacy to remove items of a personal\nnature including braces, underwire bras, etc.; a paper bag in which to place\nany personal items they have removed; and an opportunity to use a large mess\nhall style white shirt as an outer covering during reprocessing procedures. (The facility shall have at least two x-large and two xx-large mess hall style\nshirts available. The facility must specifically advise any female visitor who\nmay be required to remove an underwire bra of the availability of these shirts\nto wear as an outer garment during reprocessing procedures.)\n\nNote: A visitor shall not be routinely required to remove\nreligious headwear during search procedures. However, if staff determines\nfollowing the use of the hand scanner that removal of the headwear or any other\nitem of religious apparel is necessary, the item shall be removed in a private\narea in the presence of a security staff member of the same sex, if one is on\nduty. If no security staff member of the same sex is on duty, a non-uniformed\nstaff member of the same sex shall be used. The staff member of the same sex\nshall conduct a hand scanner search and visual inspection of both the visitor\nand the removed item in a private area. If there is no staff member of the same\nsex on duty, and the visitor still refuses or cannot remove the item due to its\npersonal nature in the visitor processing area, the visit will be\ndenied. (b) Once the\ndetected item is removed and placed in the paper bag, staff shall reprocess the\nvisitor via a hand scanner or walk-through metal detector and both the bag and\nit's contents shall be discreetly inspected for contraband. All visitors must\nbe dressed in appropriate attire, as outlined in section\n201.3\nof this Title, when not within the private area. Once the visitor has cleared the detector, the personal items shall be returned and a private area made available for\nredressing. The outer covering shirt shall be returned to a security staff\nmember. (c) Whenever possible, the\nprivate area used to disrobe shall not be the same area that is used for\nredressing. Any private area shall be out of sight of the inmate population. If\nseparate areas are not available, staff must search the area before the visitor\nenters to redress. (4)\n\nContact between processed and unprocessed\nvisitors shall be prevented. (5)\n\nIf\nstaff is unable to locate the source of the problem with the hand scanner or\nbelieves that there is probable cause for further processing, he/she shall\nfollow the strip search procedures as set forth in subdivision (f) of this\nsection, even if the visitor offers to voluntarily remove items of clothing\nother than coat, hat, or shoes. (e) Substance detection/ion scan testing. Visitors entering any department facility, by whatever gate, may be subject to\nion scanning or other non-intrusive test for detection of illicit substances. (1)\nA substance detection/ion scanner test\nmeans a search in which surface samples are taken using a handheld collection\nunit for testing in a drug and/or explosives detection device. The collection\nunit may come into contact with an individual's hands, areas of clothing, personal items, purses/handbags, packages, correspondence or any other articles\nthat may retain microscopic traces of illicit substances. A positive test\nresult may occur in any case where a person has come into contact with an\nillicit substance, whether the person has used that substance or not. All\nsubstance abuse detection/ion scan staff shall use the thresholds established\nand approved by the deputy commissioner for correctional facilities or his or\nher designee to determine whether or not a test is positive. (2)\n\nIf a visitor tests positive, a second\ntest will be conducted to confirm or negate the first test result. Upon a\nconfirmed positive test result, or test refusal, the visitor will be denied\nentrance into any correctional facility for two days. If that visitor is a\nminor child, that child's parent, guardian or approved escort will also be\ndenied entrance into the correctional facility. Otherwise, a confirmed positive\ntest result on a specific visitor will not serve as a basis to deny entrance to\nany other visitor. A confirmed positive test means that a second sample from\nthe same area on the person or the person's belongings tests positive for the\nsame substance. (3)\n\nNo disciplinary\naction shall be taken against an inmate solely because an individual that is\nattempting to visit the inmate tests positive or refuses to test. (f) Strip Searches. (1)\n\nIf a visitor to a correctional facility\nhas complied with all the aforementioned processes and the officer in charge\nreasonably believes further processing is required to prevent the introduction\nof contraband into the facility, the following action must be taken: (i) The visitor shall be asked to remain. The\nofficer in charge shall contact his or her immediate supervisor. (ii)\n\nThe supervisor will evaluate the\nsituation to determine if further processing is warranted. (2)\n\nIf the supervisor determines that further\nprocessing is warranted, the superintendent or the officer of the day during\nnon-business hours shall be notified and may authorize a consensual strip\nsearch after reviewing the matter. (i) In\norder to justify a strip search of a particular visitor, the superintendent or\nofficer of the day during non-business hours, must point to specific objective\nfacts and rational inferences that he or she is entitled to draw from those\nfacts in light of his or her experience. The superintendent must have\nreasonable cause to believe that contraband is concealed upon the person of the\nvisitor, base upon specific and articulable facts and inferences reasonably\ndrawn from those facts. Generalized suspicion of smuggling activity is\ninsufficient. (ii)\n\nStrip searches\nmay not be authorized based on uncorroborated information or \"tips\" merely\nstating that visitors would attempt to introduce contraband into a facility\nwhere the informant's reliability cannot be assessed and observations of\nvisitors by staff upon arrival at the facility do not contribute to reasonable\nsuspicion that contraband is being concealed. Reasonable suspicion exists only\nif the uncorroborated information can be linked to other objective\nfacts. (3)\n\nThe visitor\nmust be informed that he/she has the option to submit to the requested search\nprocedure or to refuse. If a visitor refuses to submit to a strip search the\nvisit will be denied. (4)\n\nGuilt is\nnot to be assumed from a visitor's refusal to submit to a strip\nsearch. (5)\n\nFuture visits may not\nbe denied on the basis of past refusal to a strip search. (6)\nA visitor's past refusal to submit to a\nstrip search may not be used as a basis or factor in establishing reasonable\nsuspicion for future strip searches. (7)\n\nIf the visitor consents to a strip\nsearch, the supervisor will obtain the visitor's written consent on Form No. 2061, \"Notice of Consent to Search.\" In the case of a minor child, the consent\nmust be given by a parent or guardian. Absent consent from an accompanying\nparent or guardian, a minor child will not be subjected to a strip search and\nwill not be permitted entry into the facility. For purposes of this section, the term minor child shall mean any person who is under the age of 18, but the\nterm shall not include any person who is emancipated (i.e., 16 years of age or\nolder who is married [with proof of age and marriage]) and who is related to\nthe inmate to be visited. (8)\n\nStrip\nsearch of a minor child. (i) In an unusual\ncircumstance when the visitor to be strip searched is a minor child, the parent\nor guardian shall be present and, at the discretion of staff, may participate\nin the strip search. (ii)\n\nIf at any\ntime during the procedure the minor child or accompanying parent or guardian\nobjects in any manner to the strip search, the procedure shall be terminated\nimmediately and the visit denied. When a minor child is unable to clear the\nsearch procedure, the escorting parent or guardian shall also be denied entry\ninto the facility. (9)\n\nStrip searches shall be conducted in locations heated to a level of human\ncomfort for disrobed persons. (10)\n\nStrip searches shall be conducted by a correction officer of the same sex as\nthe visitor being searched. (11)\n\nIn\nperforming strip searches, staff shall conduct themselves professionally. Staff\nshall be alert to the sensitive nature of the strip search and conduct such\nsearches in a manner least degrading to all involved while fulfilling the\nobjective of the search. (12)\nA\nstrip search must be reported as an unusual incident in accordance with\ndepartmental directive No. 4004, \"Unusual Incident Report.\" A subsidiary report\nof the circumstances surrounding the incident should accompany the unusual\nincident report. Particular care should be given to setting forth in detail the\nfactor or factors which led to a determination that the visitor required\nprocessing under this subdivision. (g) As a prerequisite to entry to a\ncorrectional facility, the superintendent or his or her designee shall have the\nauthority to require any visitor to surrender any article or thing to the gate\nofficer if the superintendent or his or her designee reasonably believes to be\npotentially dangerous to the safety and security of the facility or constitutes\ncontraband as defined in section\n200.3\nof this Part.
