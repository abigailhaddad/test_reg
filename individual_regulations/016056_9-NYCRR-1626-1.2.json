  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1626-1.2 - Processing applications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applications for public housing shall be processed for all site (or offsite)\ntenants interested in public housing. In accordance with section\n17\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law, these tenants have the highest priority for assignment, provided they are otherwise eligible for public housing. Section\n153\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law, under certain circumstances, allows higher income levels\nfor determining eligibility of such tenants. (b) In cases of site and offsite tenants who\nare not interested in public housing, a signed statement to that effect shall\nbe obtained. This statement does not nullify the tenant's assignment priority\nin the event he should change his mind later, but it is a basis for the\nauthority to proceed in assignment of apartments to eligible applicants in the\nnext priority category. (c) Eligibility of site and offsite tenants can generally be ascertained prior to\nthe project's apartments being ready for occupancy. However, if all apartments\nare ready for occupancy before offsite property is acquired, or if there are\ndelays in determining eligibility which are not attributable to site or offsite\ntenants, the Bureau of Management should be advised so that plans for\naccommodating such possible eligible families can be formulated. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1626-1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
