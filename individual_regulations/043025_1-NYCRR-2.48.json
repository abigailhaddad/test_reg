  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.48 - Temperature recording charts, equipment tests and examinations-Item 16p(D)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Temperature recording charts. All temperature recording charts shall be preserved for a\nperiod of three months. The use of such charts shall not exceed the time limit\nfor which they are designed. Overlapping of recorded data shall be a violation\nof this item. The following information shall be entered on the charts as\napplicable: (1)\n\nBatch pasteurizers: (i) Date. (ii)\n\nNumber or location of recorder when more\nthan one is used. (iii)\n\nExtent of\nholding period, including filling and emptying times when required, section\n2.45\nof this Part (Item\n16p[A]). (iv)\n\nReading of airspace\nthermometer within the holding period at a given time or reference point as\nindicated on the chart, section\n2.45\nof this Part (Item\n16p[A]). (v) Reading of indicating\nthermometer within the holding period at a given time or reference point as\nindicated on the chart, section\n2.45\nof this Part (Item\n16p[A]). (vi)\n\nQuarterly, the\ninitials of the regulatory agency opposite the required readings of the\nindicating thermometer and airspace thermometer, section\n2.45\nof this Part (Item\n16p[A]). (vii)\n\nQuarterly, the time\naccuracy of the record, as determined by the regulatory agency (Appendix 4, infra, Test 3). (viii)\n\nAmount and name of pasteurized milk or\nmilk product represented by each batch or run on the chart. (ix)\n\nRecord of unusual occurrences. (x) Signature or initials of\noperator. (xi)\n\nName of milk\nplant. (2)\n\nHigh-temperature-short-time pasteurizers. Recording thermometer charts shall\ncontain all the information specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) and reference to airspace thermometers in\nsubparagraph (vi), and, in addition, shall include the following: (i) A record of the time during which the\nflow-diversion device is in the forward-flow position. (ii)\n\nThe cut-in and cut-out milk temperatures\nrecorded daily by the operator at the beginning of the run, and initialed\nquarterly by the regulatory agency, section\n2.46\nof this Part (Item 16p[B]). Note: The recorded temperature shown on the controller chart\nshall be used to determine that the required temperature for milk products\ncontaining higher fat and/or sweeteners has been achieved. (3)\n\nEquipment tests and\nexaminations. The regulatory agency shall perform the indicated tests on the\nfollowing instruments and devices initially on installation, and at least once\neach three months thereafter, and whenever any alteration or replacement is\nmade which may affect the proper operation of the instrument or device, provided that the holding time test shall be conducted at least every six\nmonths. (See table in subdivision [b] of this section.)\n(4)\n\nRemoval of regulatory seals and\nresumption of pasteurization. No equipment required to be sealed pursuant to\nsection\n2.46\nof this Part shall be used if\nthe regulatory seal has been broken unless the conditions set forth in\nsubparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this paragraph are met: (i) the commissioner is notified\npromptly; (ii)\nthe provisions of\nsection\n2.46\nof this Part are otherwise\ncontinuously met and compliance therewith is documented in a form satisfactory\nto the commissioner; and\n(iii)\na\nsample of the milk, milk product, melloream or frozen dessert processed or\nmanufactured in such equipment is properly taken immediately after the\nresumption of pasteurization and every two hours thereafter and properly\nanalyzed in an officially designated laboratory for the presence of phosphatase\nand is found to not exceed the phosphatase standard set forth in section\n2.8\nof this Part. No milk, milk\nproducts, melloream or frozen dessert processed or manufactured in equipment\nfrom which a seal has been broken shall be removed from the milk plant until\nthe processing plant superintendent determines that all of the provisions set\nforth in subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this paragraph have been\nmet. (b) Table. Instrument or\ndevice\n\nTest No. Test objective\n\nBatch pasteurizer indicating thermometer\n1\n\nAccuracy. Batch pasteurizer recording thermometer\n2\n\nTemperature accuracy. Batch pasteurizer recording thermometer\n3\n\nTime accuracy. Batch pasteurizer recording thermometer\n4\n\nCheck reading of recording thermometer against\nindicating thermometer. Airspace thermometer\n1\n\nAccuracy. Valves\n6\n\nLeakage in plug-type leak-protector valves and\npoppet-type valves. HTST indicating thermometer\n1\n\nAccuracy.
