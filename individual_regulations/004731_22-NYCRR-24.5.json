Tit. 22 § 24.5 - Workers' compensation leave\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nEmployees necessarily absent from\nduty because of an occupational injury, disease or condition as defined in the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law, incurred on or after the effective date of this\nsection, shall be eligible for a workers' compensation benefit as provided by\nlaw, and the treatment of time and leave benefits shall be as provided in this\nsection. (2)\nA\nworkers' compensation injury shall mean any occupational injury, disease or\ncondition found compensable as defined in the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw. (3)\n\nThe\ntreatment of time and leave benefits for an employee necessarily absent from\nduty because of an occupational injury, disease or condition incurred through\nan assault to the employee, suffered by the employee in the pursuit of a\ncriminal, or incurred while coming to the aid of an employee, member of the\npublic or in response to an emergency, shall be as provided to nonjudicial\nuniformed employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement between the\n\nUnified Court System and the Civil Service Employees Association, Inc., Local\n1000, AFSCME (AFL-CIO). (b) An employee who suffers compensable\noccupational injury shall, upon completion of a 10-workday waiting period, be\nplaced on a leave of absence without pay for all absences necessitated by such\ninjury and shall receive the benefit provided by the Workers' Compensation Law\nexcept as modified in this section. (c) An employee necessarily absent for\nless than a full day in connection with a workers' compensation injury due to\ntherapy, a doctor's appointment, or other required continuing treatment may\ncharge accrued leave for said absences. (d) An employee required to serve a waiting\nperiod pursuant to subsection (b) of this subdivision shall have the option of\nusing accrued leave credits or being placed on leave without pay. When an\nemployee has charged credits, upon receipt of documentation from the State\n\nInsurance Fund issuing a credit for the time charged, the employee shall be\nentitled to restoration of credits charged proportional to the net monetary\naward credited to the Unified Court System by the Workers' Compensation Board. In the event the restoration of credits is not sufficient to restore the full\namount of accrued leave used during the waiting period, the State shall credit\nto the employees' leave accruals the difference between the accrued leave used\nand the Workers' Compensation Board Credit. (e) When annual leave credits are\nrestored pursuant to this section and such restoration causes the total annual\nleave credits to exceed 54 days, a period of one year from the date of the\nreturn of the credits or the date of return to work, whichever is later, shall\nbe allowed to reduce the total accumulation to 54 days. (f) An employee receiving\nworkers' compensation payments for a period of disability found compensable by\nthe Workers' Compensation Board shall be treated as though the employee is on\nthe payroll for the length of the disability, not to exceed 12 months per\ninjury, for the sole purposes of accruing seniority, credit for continuous\nservice, eligibility for health insurance, accrual of vacation and sick leave\ncredit, and retirement credit and contributions. (g) (1)\n\nWhere an employee's workers'\ncompensation claim is controverted by the State Insurance Fund, the employee\nmay utilize leave credits (including sick leave at half pay, if eligible)\npending a determination by the Workers' Compensation Board. (2)\n\nIf the employee's\ncontroverted or contested claim is decided in the employee's favor, any leave\ncredits charged (and sick leave at half pay eligibility) shall be restored\nproportional to the net monetary award credited to the Unified Court System by\nthe Workers' Compensation Board. (3)\n\nIf the employee was in leave without\npay status pending determination of a controverted or contested claim, and the\nclaim is decided in the employee's favor, the employee shall receive the\nbenefits in subdivision (f) of this section for the period covered by the\naward, not to exceed 12 months per injury. (h) If the date of the\ndisability incident is prior to the effective date of this section, the\nbenefits available shall be provided as set forth in the provisions of this\nsection in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this\nsection.
