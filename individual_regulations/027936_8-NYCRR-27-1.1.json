  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 27-1.1 - Student eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n\nTo be eligible for benefits pursuant to the provisions of\nsection\n6451\nof the\n\nEducation Law, a student must be both educationally and economically\ndisadvantaged according to the following criteria: (a) Educationally disadvantaged. Each\ninstitution shall establish its own criteria for educationally disadvantaged, which shall include, but not be limited to, the following factors: predicting a\nstudent's probability of academic success, and nonadmissibility, by the\ncollege's normal admissions standards, to the college at the matriculated\nstatus in a degree program. Consideration for admission into this program shall\nbe given to the most educationally disadvantaged students based on each\ninstitution's established criteria. Recipients of Regents scholarships for\nacademic excellence are not eligible. Students who previously attended another\ninstitution at which they were enrolled in an opportunity program pursuant to\n\nEducation Law sections 6451 and 6452 may be eligible for the benefits of the\nHEOP program at the latter institution. (b) Economically disadvantaged. (1)\nA student is economically disadvantaged\nif he or she is a member of a household where the total annual income of such\nhousehold is equal to or less than 185 percent of the amount under the annual\n\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines for\nthe applicant's family size for the applicable year. Federal poverty guidelines\nare published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services in the\n\nFederal Register. Moreover, the opportunity programs defined by Education Law\nsections 6451 and 6452 (HEOP, EOP, SEEK/CD) are expected to give priority to\nthe recruitment and enrollment of applicants whose life patterns are\ncharacterized by historical economic and educational disadvantage. (i) Indicators of historical economic and\neducational disadvantage may include evidence that the student or the student's\nfamily has endured long-term economic deprivation, membership in a group\nunder-represented in higher education, a history of high unemployment rates, a\nrecord of poor academic performance, and/or little or no accumulation of\nassets. Other indicators may include that the applicant or the applicant's\nfamily are unable to provide for more than the basic needs of family members\nand may be dependent on public assistance. (ii)\n\nLoss of employment, or the separation, divorce or death of a wage earner in the calendar year prior to the academic\nyear for which eligibility is being established and a resulting decrease in\nfamily income below income guidelines is not, in itself, sufficient to\nestablish historical economic disadvantage. Such cases must be reviewed\ncarefully in order to determine longer term past patterns of economic\ndisadvantage. (2)\nA\nmaximum of 15 percent of the total number of HEOP students enrolled by an\ninstitution at any given time may come from households whose income exceeds 185\npercent of the amount under the annual United States Department of Health and\n\nHuman Services poverty guidelines for the applicant's family size for the\napplicable year, provided such institution has established to the satisfaction\nof the commissioner or his/ her designee that unusual and extenuating\ncircumstances as defined in this paragraph, exist for each such student. Documentation shall be kept on file by the institution at which such students\nwere enrolled, and shall be corroborated by a disinterested, reliable party. For purposes of this paragraph, unusual and extenuating circumstances shall be\nlimited to the following: (i) serious\nmismanagement of the household income with little accruing to the interest of\nthe student; or\n(ii)\na one-time\nfluctuation in household income where there is a history of low income. Satisfactory evidence that a household's income in the calendar year prior to\nthe calendar year used for determining the student's economic eligibility fell\nwithin the limits of the applicable household income scale shall be sufficient\nto establish the existence of a one-time fluctuation in household income, if\nthere is satisfactory proof of a history of low income; or\n(iii)\nhouseholds with substantial long-term\nnonreimbursed medical obligations; or\n(iv)\nfamilies which must maintain two\nhouseholds to maintain employment, if there is satisfactory documentation of a\nhistory of low income. (4)\n\nReference to the household income scale\nneed not be made if the student falls into one of the following categories, and\ndocumentation is available: (i) the student's\nfamily is the recipient of family assistance program aid or safety net\nassistance through the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability\n\nAssistance or a county department of social services; or is the recipient of\nfamily day-care payments through the New York State Office of Children and\n\nFamily Services or a county department of social services or their successor\noffices; (ii)\nthe student is living\nwith foster parents who do not provide support for college, and no monies are\nprovided from the natural parents; or\n(iii)\nthe student is a ward of the State or a\ncounty. (5)\n\nThe\neligibility standards set forth in this section apply only at the time of\nadmission as a first-time freshman to a program. Once admitted, a student will\ncontinue to receive supportive services as needed, even if the family income\nrises above the current eligibility standards. However, a student's economic\nstatus shall be reviewed under a recognized needs analysis system each year and\nappropriate adjustments made in the student's financial aid package. (6)\n\nThe following shall be acceptable\ndocumentation of paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subdivision: (i) Documentation of all income, earned\ndividends and interest: signed copy of appropriate year's tax return (I.R.S. form 1040 or 1040a or 1040EZ, or 4506). (ii)\n\nDocumentation of no income: a copy of\nI.R.S. form 4506-T which has been filed by the student or family with the\n\nInternal Revenue Service or its successor office indicating that the student or\nparent did not file a return. (iii)\n\nDocumentation of pension, annuity or unemployment benefits: letter from the\napplicable agency showing appropriate year's total award (if not reported on\nI.R.S. form 1040, 1040a or 1099). (iv)\n\nDocumentation of social security, supplemental security income or Veterans Administration noneducational\nbenefits: letter from the applicable agency showing applicable year's total\naward for each member of the household or I.R.S. form 1099 for each member of\nthe household. (v) Documentation of\nsocial services payments: verification from a branch of the Office of Temporary\nand Disability Assistance or Office of Children and Family Services or their\nsuccessor offices, showing year of benefits received and names of\nrecipients. (vi)\n\nDocumentation of\nchild support and/or alimony: court order, affidavit, or student's financial\naid form (FAF). (vii)\n\nDocumentation\nof additional members in household: birth certificates, marriage certificates, third-party verification, or similar documentation acceptable to the\ncommissioner. (c) Income. (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision, income, as used in this Subpart, means all taxable and\nnontaxable funds which are received by the household. Such funds may be derived\nfrom sources including but not limited to wages, dividends, interest, social\nsecurity, disability pensions, veterans' benefits and unemployment\nbenefits. (2)\n\nThe following shall\nnot constitute income: (i) Monies received\nspecifically for educational purposes from sources such as social security, veteran's cost of education benefits, and education grants from the Office of\n\nVocational Rehabilitation or its successor office. (ii)\n\nSocial services or public assistance\npayments received through the family assistance program, safety net assistance, and the family day-care program, or social security supplemental\nincome.
