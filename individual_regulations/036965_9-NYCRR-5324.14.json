(1)\n\nPrior to the first card being dealt, each\nplayer at the multiple-action blackjack game shall make a minimum of one wager\nin both circle one and two and may opt to place a third wager in circle three\nwithin the posted minimums and maximums in succession against the dealer that\nshall win if: (i) at the completion of a\nround of play, the total of the player is 21 or less and the total of the\ndealer is in excess of 21; (ii)\nat\nthe completion of a round of play the total of the player exceeds that of the\ndealer without either exceeding 21, or; (iii)\nthe player has achieved a total of 21\nin two cards and the dealer has achieved a total of 21 in more than two\ncards. (2)\n\nExcept as\notherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a\nwager shall be void when the total of the player is the same as the dealer, provided however, that a player's wager shall lose when the dealer has a\nblackjack and the player has a simple 21 that is not a blackjack. (3)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this\nsection, no wagers shall be made, increased or withdrawn after the first card\nof the respective round has been dealt. (4)\n\nAll wagers at blackjack shall be made by\nplacing chips or plaques and, if applicable, table game promotional coupons on\nthe appropriate areas of the blackjack layout. (5)\n\nThe gaming facility shall establish the\nminimum wagers permitted at each multiple-action blackjack table. The minimum\nand maximum wagers as established by the gaming facility shall be and remain\nconspicuously posted on a sign at each table. (6)\n\nAll winning wagers made in accordance\nwith paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be paid at no less than odds of\n1:1 with the exception of blackjack, which shall be paid at no less than odds\nof 3:2. (7)\n\nOnce the first card of\nany hand has been removed from the shoe by the dealer, no player shall handle, remove or alter any wager that has been made until a decision has been rendered\nand implemented with respect to that wager except as permitted by this\nsection. (8)\n\nOnce a wager on the\ninsurance line, a wager to double down or a wager to split pairs has been made\nand confirmed by the dealer, no player shall handle, remove or alter such\nwagers until a decision has been rendered and implemented with respect to that\nwager except as explicitly permitted by this Part. (9)\n\nThe gaming facility may implement any of\nthe following options at a multiple-action blackjack table: (i) players who have not made a wager on the\nfirst round of play may not enter the game on a subsequent round of play until\na re-shuffle of the cards has occurred; (ii)\nplayers who have not made a wager on the\nfirst round of play may be permitted to enter the game, but may be limited to\nwagering only the minimum limit posted at the table until a re-shuffle of the\ncards has occurred; (iii)\nplayers\nwho, after making a wager on a given round of play, decline to wager on any\nsubsequent round of play may be precluded from placing any further wagers until\na re-shuffle of the cards has occurred; and\n(iv)\nplayers who, after making a wager on a\ngiven round of play, decline to wager on any subsequent round of play may be\npermitted to place further wagers, but may be limited to wagering only the\nminimum limit posted at the table until a reshuffle of the cards has\noccurred. (10)\n\nIf a\ngaming facility implements any of the options in paragraph (9) of this\nsubdivision the option shall be applied uniformly to all players at that table; provided, however, that if the gaming facility has implemented either of the\noptions in subparagraphs (iii) or (iv) of paragraph (9) of this subdivision, an\nexception may be made for a player who temporarily leaves the table if, at the\ntime the player leaves, the gaming facility agrees to reserve the player's spot\nuntil such player's return. (c) Procedure for dealing cards. (1)\n\nAll cards used at the game of\nmultiple-action blackjack shall be dealt from a dealing shoe. (2)\n\nEach dealer shall remove cards from the\nshoe with the dealer's left hand, turn the cards face up and then place the\ncards on the appropriate area of the layout with the dealer's right hand, except that the dealer has the option to deal cards to the first three\npositions with the dealer's left hand. (3)\n\nAfter each full set of cards is placed in\nthe shoe, the dealer shall remove the first card face down and place such card\nin the discard. Each new dealer who comes to the table also shall burn one card\nas described in this paragraph before the new dealer deals any cards to the\nplayers. The burn card shall be disclosed to all players if requested. Cards\nshall be delivered as follows. (i) one card\nface up to each box on the layout in which a wager is contained; (ii)\none card face up to the\ndealer; (iii)\na second card face up\nto each box in which a wager is contained; (iv)\none card face down to the dealer, which\nshall be known as the hole card; and\n(v) the gaming facility may choose to deliver\nall determinate cards to the player before the dealer receives the dealer's\nsecond card. (4)\n\nIf the\ndealer's first card is an ace, king, queen, jack or 10, the dealer shall\ndetermine whether the hole card will give the dealer a natural blackjack prior\nto dealing any additional cards to the players at the table. (i) If the gaming facility elects to use a\ncard reader device, the dealer shall insert the hole card into the card reader\ndevice by moving the card face down on the layout without exposing such card's\nvalue to anyone at the table, including the dealer. If the dealer has a natural\nblackjack, no additional cards shall be dealt and each player's wager shall be\nsettled. (ii)\n\nIf the gaming\nfacility does not elect to use a card reader device, the dealer shall determine\nthe value of the hole card by peeking discreetly at the card without exposing\nsuch card's value to any other person. If the dealer has a natural blackjack, no additional cards shall be dealt and each player's wager shall be\nsettled. (iii)\n\nIf the gaming\nfacility chooses to deliver all determinate cards to the player before the\ndealer receives the dealer's second card, the players shall have the option to\nmake an insurance wager at the same time as set forth in subdivision (g) of\nthis section. (5)\n\nAfter\ntwo cards have been dealt to each player and the dealer does not have a natural\nblackjack, the dealer shall, beginning from the dealer's left, announce the\npoint total starting with the first player from the dealers left until each\nplayer's hand is announced. As each player's point total is announced, such\nplayer shall indicate whether he or she wishes to surrender, double down, split\npairs, stand or draw as provided for by this Part. (6)\n\nAs each player indicates a decision, the\ndealer shall deal face up whatever additional cards are necessary to effectuate\nsuch decision consistent with this section and shall announce the new point\ntotal of such player's hand after each additional card is dealt. (7)\nA player whose point total exceeds 21\nshall lose all three wagers and such player's cards shall be collected by the\ndealer. (8)\n\nAfter decisions of each\nplayer have been implemented and all additional cards have been dealt, the\ndealer shall expose the dealer's hole card. Any additional cards required to be\ndealt to the hand of the dealer shall be dealt face up. After the dealer's hand\nhas been completed, the dealer shall announce the point count. If the gaming\nfacility chooses to deliver all determinate cards to the player before the\ndealer receives the dealer's second card, the dealer shall remove the next card\nfrom the dealing shoe and place such card face up on the layout next to the\ndealer's hole card. (9)\n\nAt the\nconclusion of the first round of play, the dealer shall pay or collect only the\nfirst-round wagers starting with the players to the dealer's far right and\nmoving counter clockwise around the table. The dealer shall then remove all of\nthe dealer's cards to the right of the original up card and place such cards in\nthe discard rack. (10)\nA second\nround shall then commence with the dealer using the same face up card and\nfollowing the same procedures for drawing additional cards, collecting losing\nwagers and paying winning wagers as warranted. The player's hand shall remain\nunchanged for each round of play. (11)\nA third and final round shall be played\nfollowing the same procedures as set forth in paragraphs (5) and (6) of this\nsubdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
