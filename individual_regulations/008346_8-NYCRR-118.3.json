  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 118.3 - Evaluation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as\notherwise provided in subdivision (b) of this section, each school district\nresponsible for the provision of educational programs pursuant to Education\n\nLaw, section 3202(7) shall assure that an educational evaluation is completed\nas soon as possible, but in no case later than 10 school days after the\ndistrict's receipt of a request for educational services on behalf of a youth\neligible to receive educational services. The educational evaluation shall be\nadministered in the student's dominant language and shall assess at a minimum\nthe student's development in reading, mathematics, and receptive and expressive\nlanguage. If such evaluation indicates the possible need for a more intensive\nprogram of educational services, a multidisciplinary assessment shall be\nperformed and programmatic recommendations based on that assessment shall be\nmade to the student's teacher not later than 20 school days after the\ndistrict's receipt of a request for educational services. (b) Information obtained from schools\npreviously attended by the student, from the student's presentencing report or\nfrom other comparable sources may be used to supplement the assessments\nrequired by the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section. In the event\nthat the information so obtained includes the results of adequate educational\nassessments of the student conducted within three years prior to the district's\nreceipt of the request for educational services, such results may be used to\nsatisfy, in whole or in part, the requirement of subdivision (a) of this\nsection that an educational evaluation of the student be conducted.
