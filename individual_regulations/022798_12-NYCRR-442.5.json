Tit. 12 § 442.5 - Review by the Board of a Prior Authorization Denial\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If the Carrier's Physician issues a\ndenial or a partial approval, the medical provider may seek review by the\n\nBoard's Medical Director's Office. The medical provider may not seek review by\nthe Board's Medical Director's Office unless the medical provider has received\na denial or partial approval by the Carrier's Physician. (b) All requests for review of denials or\npartial approvals of a Prior Authorization request shall be submitted to the\n\nMedical Director's Office in the format prescribed by the Chair. The Chair or\n\nMedical Director may designate private entities to evaluate such requests for\nreview of denials by a Carrier's Physician provided that the entity has: 1. the appropriate URAC accreditation or such\naccreditation/certification as designated by the Chair, 2. other demonstrated expertise and criteria\nestablished by the Board; and\n3. no\nconflict of interest exists in resolving the subject dispute. (c) When a prescribing medical\nprovider wishes to request review of a denial or partial approval of a Prior\n\nAuthorization request, the medical provider shall submit the request to the\n\nMedical Director's Office in the format prescribed by the Chair within 10\ncalendar days of the denial date together with all documentation submitted in\nsupport of its Prior Authorization request, and the denial or partial approval\nissued by the Carrier's Physician. (d) A decision by the Medical Director's\n\nOffice (or designated accredited entity) is final and binding on the medical\nprovider, the carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator. Such\ndecision shall be binding and not appealable under Workers' Compensation Law\nsection 23. (e) Notwithstanding\nparagraph (d) herein, a claimant may request review of a Medical Director's\n\nOffice decision, by filing a Request for Further Action, that demonstrates that\nsuch durable medical equipment is medically necessary and denial of the Prior\n\nAuthorization request adversely impacts the claimant's interests. The Board may\nrespond to such requests for review by letter or by referral to adjudication, as appropriate in the discretion of the Chair or his or her designee. Such\ndecisions shall be binding and not appealable under Workers' Compensation Law\nsection 23. (f) In the event that a\n\nPrior Authorization request is denied on the merits, the medical provider may\nnot submit a request for Prior Authorization for the same durable medical\nequipment unless he or she submits evidence that there has been a change in the\nclaimant's medical condition that renders the denial of the request for Prior\n\nAuthorization no longer applicable to the claimant's current medical\ncondition.
