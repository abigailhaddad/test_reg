  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 465.15 - Division initiated settlements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The general counsel, or his or her\ndesignee may, at any time after a finding of probable cause, endeavor to\nachieve settlement of a case by proposing a settlement to the respondent which, if agreed to by respondent, will be proposed to complainant, who must agree to\nsuch settlement proposal or reject it for sufficient reasons stated in\nobjections. If the proposed settlement is agreed to by respondent and rejected\nby complainant without sufficient reasons, the case will be dismissed for\nadministrative convenience or an equitable order will be recommended. (b) The general counsel may, in his or her\ndiscretion, determine that a case is appropriate for a division initiated\nsettlement. He or she shall set a settlement value for the case in the form of\na lump sum dollar amount, or by such other formula as may be appropriate, and\nshall formulate such other terms as would provide an appropriate resolution of\nthe case. The settlement value may be the same as an offer of settlement\npreviously made by a party and rejected by the opposing party. (c) After the settlement has been formulated, a letter setting forth all the proposed terms of the division initiated\nsettlement will be sent to the respondent, along with such other information as\nis necessary to explain the division initiated settlement process. Respondent\nshall have a specified time in which to indicate whether respondent will agree\nto such settlement. (d) If the\nrespondent agrees to the terms of the division initiated settlement, then the\nsettlement terms, and the explanation of the division initiated settlement\nprocess shall be sent to the complainant. The complainant shall have a stated\ntime period in which to agree to the settlement or submit written objections\nthereto. The objections shall be specific and in detail. (e) After consideration of complainant's\nobjections, the general counsel shall either accept the objections and refer\nthe case on for hearing, or shall reject the objections and provide complainant\nwith an additional period of time to accept the settlement. (f) If the complainant does not agree to a\nsettlement within the allotted time, and the complainant's objections are not\naccepted by the general counsel, then the case may be dismissed for\nadministrative convenience, or upon request of the respondent, the general\ncounsel may issue a recommended equitable order, for the commissioner's\nconsideration, providing that the respondent will pay the complainant the\namount proposed in the settlement and dismissing the complaint on the\nmerits. (g) In determining the\nsettlement value of the case, and the other terms of settlement to be proposed, and in evaluating the reasonableness of a complainant's objections, the general\ncounsel shall consider, among other things, the following: (1)\nthe probability of success after\nhearing; (2)\nthe amount of\ncomplainant's economic loss, and respondent's degree of responsibility\ntherefor; (3)\nin appropriate cases, the evidence of the amount of complainant's mental pain and\nsuffering; (4)\nthe egregiousness of\nthe discrimination charged; and\n(5)\nwhether the public interest requires the continuation of the\nproceedings. (h) The\nproposed division initiated settlement shall contain terms as set forth in\nsection\n465.16\n(b) of this Part. (i) A successful\ndivision initiated settlement shall be confirmed by an order of the\ncommissioner, as set forth in section\n465.16\n(c) of this Part. (j) The general\ncounsel, or any other division representative, shall not disclose what has\ntranspired in the course of attempts at division initiated settlement, except\nto the parties and their representatives, and except that: (1)\nin those cases where the division\ninitiated settlement attempt results in a dismissal for administrative\nconvenience, the dismissal shall contain a recital of the proposed settlement, and the reasons that the complainant's objections to it were rejected; and\n(2)\nin those cases that result\nin an order of the commissioner, the terms of the settlement may be disclosed\nas with any final order of the division.
