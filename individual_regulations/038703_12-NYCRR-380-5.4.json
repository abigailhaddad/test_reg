  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 380-5.4 - Acceptance or denial of claim\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Once the carrier or self-insured employer receives a completed request for paid\nfamily leave with the necessary certification as identified in Subpart 380-4 of\nthis Part, the carrier or self-insured employer must pay the claim or deny the\nclaim within 18 days. In the event a completed request is received more than 18\ndays before the occurrence of a qualifying event, the carrier or self-insured\nemployer shall send payment to the employee within 5 days following the\nqualifying event. (1)\n\nThe chair may prescribe\nthe format of a denial for request for paid family leave, and with the first\npayment or denial, the carrier or self-insured employer must provide contact\ninformation, including a contact person's name or office, mailing address, email, and contact phone number, as well as any form identifiers prescribed by\nthe chair such as name, number or bar code. A paid family leave denial must\nstate the reason, repeat any relevant information filed in the request for paid\nfamily leave, and include any other information considered by the carrier in\nmaking the decision. (2)\n\nUnless the\nemployee requests to receive correspondence by regular mail, the carrier or\nself-insured employer may send the denial and accompanying information by\nemail. (3)\n\nWhenever a claim for\npaid family leave is the responsibility of the special fund for disability\nbenefits pursuant to section\n213\nof the Workers' Compensation Law, the chair may waive the special fund for\ndisability benefits' obligation to pay or deny within 18 days. (b) The carrier or self-insured\nemployer may deny the claim without prejudice for the following reasons: (1)\nincomplete claim package; or\n(2)\ninsufficient certification or proof of\neligibility. (c) If the\nclaim is denied without prejudice due to an incomplete claim package, the\ncarrier or self-insured employer must notify the employee of each piece of\nrequired information, as identified in the request for paid family leave\n(currently form PFL-1) and sections\n380-4.2, 380-4.3, and\n380-4.4\nof this Part, which is\nmissing from the employee's request for paid family leave. If the claim is not\nrefiled within 30 days from when leave was first taken, the carrier or\nself-insured employer may deny the claim. (d) The carrier or self-insured employer may\ndeny the claim for the following reasons: (1)\nemployee has not been employed by the employer for a sufficient length of time\nto be eligible for benefits; (2)\nemployee is not an employee of the employer; (3)\nemployee is not an employee of a covered\nemployer; (4)\nthe family member\nthat the employee is seeking leave to care for is not a covered family member\nunder subdivision (20) of section\n201\nof the Workers' Compensation Law; or\n(5)\nthe amount of leave requested exceeds the\nstatutory maximum benefit period for family leave or disability benefits under\narticle 9 of the Workers' Compensation Law; (6)\nthe amount of family leave requested\nexceeds the statutory maximum or the family leave needed as stated in the\nmedical certification of the employee or the qualifying event was foreseeable\nand the employee failed to provide the employer with notice as required in\n\nSubpart 380-3 of this Part. In such a case, the carrier may issue a partial\ndenial of any excess leave or a partial denial for 30 days when the qualifying\nevent was foreseeable and the employee failed to provide the employer with\nnotice. All benefits requested that have not been denied must be paid within\nthe statutory time frame; (7)\nthe\nemployee requesting leave is the perpetrator of domestic violence or child\nabuse against the care recipient; or\n(8)\nthe claim was not timely made; (9)\nthe employer did not have coverage on the\ndate family leave began; (i) when the board\nhas identified a carrier as providing coverage, the carrier shall pay family\nleave benefits to the employee without prejudice while the dispute regarding\ncoverage is resolved. Whenever a claim for paid family leave is the\nresponsibility of the special fund for disability benefits pursuant to section\n213\nof the Workers' Compensation Law, the chair may waive the special fund for\ndisability benefit's obligation to pay without prejudice; (ii)\nwhen a basis for a denial is lack of\ninsurance coverage, the insurance carrier shall provide the board with a copy\nof the denial. (e) Failure of the employer to complete, or\ninadequate completion by the employer, of the employer section on the request\nfor paid family leave is not a valid basis for denial by the carrier. (f) If the employee is eligible to receive\nbenefits at the time of submission of the request for paid family leave with\nthe carrier, the carrier or self-insured employer must accept the claim and\nmake payment to the employee within 18 days. In addition to any other\napplicable penalties, any benefits paid after 18 days shall draw simple\ninterest from 10 days after notice was given, at the rate provided in section\n5004\nof the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules. (g) The employee and carrier\nor self-insured employer should make every effort to informally resolve a\ndenial of benefits. (h) The carrier\nor self-insured employer shall make all reasonable efforts, consistent with the\nprinciples set forth in Executive Order 26, issued October 6, 2011, to\ncommunicate with respect to the paid family leave claim in the language\nidentified by the employee on the request for paid family leave form. (i) The insurance carrier on the first date\nof paid family leave taken by the employee will be deemed the insurance carrier\nfor the whole period of paid family leave for a 52 week period from the first\ndate of leave taken, except that when an employee changes employers with a\ndifferent insurance carrier, the existing carrier's coverage of the employee is\nterminated and the employee must become eligible under the new covered\nemployer's coverage.
