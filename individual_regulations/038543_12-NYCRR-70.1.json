  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 70.1 - Application\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The provisions\nof this Part shall apply to the filing, processing, hearing, consideration and\ndetermination of an appeal from minimum wage orders and regulations pursuant to\nsections 657 and 676. (b) See Part\n65 of this Title for general rules of procedure and practice not specified in\nthis Part. (c) The State Minimum\n\nWage Act (Article 19) empowers the Commissioner of Labor to establish minimum\nwage orders and regulations for certain occupations in accordance with the\nprocedure prescribed therein. Article 19-A provides that minimum wage standards\nshall apply to farm workers, who prior to that enactment were excluded from\nminimum wage regulation. Such orders and regulations are final unless appealed\nas provided in Sections 657 and 676, respectively. Those sections accord an\naggrieved party in interest the right to petition the Board to determine\nwhether such orders or regulations are contrary to law. The jurisdiction of the\n\nBoard to entertain such a proceeding is primary and exclusive. Its decision is\nfinal, subject to a direct appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme\n\nCourt, Third Judicial Department, within sixty days after its decision is\nissued. The findings of the Commissioner of Labor as to the facts on any appeal\nfrom the provisions of a minimum wage order or regulation are conclusive. An\nappeal to the Board does not stay a minimum wage order or regulation issued\nunder the Minimum Wage Acts unless the appellant provides security or obtains a\nwaiver of security as prescribed in sections 657 or 676, supra. The nature of\nan appeal from wage orders and regulations differs in material respects from an\nappeal of a compliance order under Section 677 (see Part 71) and from a review\nof an order issued under Section 218 or Section 219 (see Part 6 5).
