Tit. 20 §§ 9-2.2 - Determination of applicable methodology\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A corporation must use the aggregate\nmethod in determining its tax with respect to its interest in a partnership if\nthe corporation has access to the information necessary to compute its tax\nusing such method. A corporation is presumed to have access to the information\nif any one of the following is met: (1)\nit is\nconducting a unitary business with the partnership; (2)\nit is a general partner of the\npartnership or is a managing member of a limited liability company that is\ntreated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes; (3)\nit has a 5% or more interest in the\npartnership determined in the manner provided in section\n1-2.3\n(e)(1)\nof\nthis Subchapter; (4)\nit has\nreported information from the partnership in a prior taxable year using the\naggregate method; (5)\nits\npartnership interest constitutes more than 50% of its total assets; (6)\nits basis in its interest in the\npartnership pursuant to IRC section 705 and\n26 CFR\n1.705-1\non the last day of the partnership\nyear that ends within or with the corporation's taxable year is more than\n$5,000,000; (7)\nany member of its\naffiliated group or New York combined group has the information necessary to\nperform such computation; or\n(8)\nit\nis claiming a tax credit based upon the activities of the partnership or\nclaiming a tax credit computed at the partnership level that flows through from\nthe partnership to the corporation. (b) (1)\n\nIf\na corporation does not meet any of the presumptions set forth in subdivision\n(a) of this section and does not and will not have access to the information\nnecessary to compute its tax using the aggregate method within the time period\nallowed for filing a report, determined with regard to all available extensions\nof time to file, and certifies these facts to the Commissioner, the corporation\nmust use the entity method. (2)\n\nIf\na corporation meets one or more of the presumptions set forth in subdivision\n(a) of this section, but the corporation establishes to the satisfaction of the\n\nCommissioner that it, any member of its affiliated group, or any member of its\n\nNew York combined group does not and will not have access to the information\nnecessary to compute the corporation's tax using the aggregate method within\nthe time period allowed for filing a report, determined with regard to all\navailable extensions of time to file, and certifies these facts to the\n\nCommissioner, then the corporation must use the entity method. (c) If a corporation is a partner\nin a partnership (\"upper tier partnership\") and such partnership is a partner\nin another partnership (\"lower tier partnership\") and the corporation has the\nnecessary information to use the aggregate method with respect to the items of\nreceipts, income, gain, loss, deduction, assets and liabilities, and activities\nof the upper tier partnership that are not attributable to the lower tier\npartnership, but does not have the necessary information to use the aggregate\nmethod with respect to such items that are attributable to the lower tier\npartnership, then such corporation must use the aggregate method with respect\nto the items of receipts, income, gain, loss, deduction, assets and\nliabilities, and activities of the upper tier partnership that are not\nattributable to the lower tier partnership and must use the entity method with\nrespect to such items that are attributable to the lower tier partnership. If\nthere are additional tiers of partnerships, this methodology m u s t be\nemployed at each tier. The corporation w i l l be presumed to have access to\nthe necessary information with respect to a lower tier partnership and will be\nsubject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this section\nwith respect to a lower tier partnership if one or more of the presumptions set\nforth in subdivision (a) of this section are met at each tier. If the\ncorporation does not meet any of the presumptions set forth in subdivision (a)\nof this section and does not have access to the necessary information with\nrespect to a lower tier partnership the provisions of paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section will apply. (d) (1)\n\nFor\npurposes of this section, the term \"affiliated group\" will have the same\nmeaning as such term has in IR C section 1504, except that the term \"common\nparent corporation\" will be deemed to mean any person as defined in IRC section\n7701(a)(1). Such section 1504 must be read without regard to the exclusions\nprovided for in section 1504(b). (2)\n\nFor purposes of this section, a\npartnership interest constitutes more than 50% of a corporation's total assets\nif its interest in the partnership is more than 50% of the corporation's total\nassets. In determining its interest in the partnership and its total assets, the corporation may elect to use ending amounts, the average of the beginning\nand ending amounts as reported on the corporation's balance sheet included in\nits Federal income tax return, or average amounts determined on a more frequent\nbasis as determined in a manner consistent with the corporation's balance sheet\nincluded in its Federal income tax return. Whichever method a corporation\nelects to use, it must use that method for all of its assets. If the\ncorporation is not required to include a balance sheet in its Federal income\ntax return, it must use a method that it would have used if it had been\nrequired to include a balance sheet in its Federal income tax return. An alien\ncorporation must use only amounts that are effectively connected with its\n\nUnited States trade or business. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
