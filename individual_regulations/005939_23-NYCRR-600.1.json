  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23 § 600.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor purposes of this Part, the following definitions\napply: (a) Amount\nfinanced\nmeans, with respect to: (1)\nsales-based financing, the amount of funds to be provided by the financer to\nthe recipient or on the recipient's behalf, minus any prepaid finance\ncharge; (2)\na closed-end financing, the principal amount, plus any other amounts that are financed by the financer\nand are not part of the finance charge, minus any prepaid finance\ncharge; (3)\na commercial open-end\nfinancing, the approved credit limit, minus any prepaid finance\ncharge; (4)\na factoring transaction\ndisclosure made pursuant to Financial Services Law section 806, the receivables\npurchase price, minus any prepaid finance charge; (5)\nan asset-based lending transaction, the\napproved credit limit; and\n(6)\na\nlease financing transaction, if the financer: (i) does not select, manufacture or supply\nthe goods to be leased, the net cost to the financer to acquire the property to\nbe leased, including any related costs and charges financed as a part of such\ntransaction, which may include installation charges, delivery costs, software\nlicense fees, sales and use taxes, minus any prepaid finance charge; or\n(ii)\nselects, manufactures or\nsupplies the goods to be leased, the price that the financer would sell the\ngoods in a cash transaction, including any related costs and charges financed\nas a part of such transaction, which may include installation charges, delivery\ncosts, software license fees, sales and use taxes, minus any prepaid finance\ncharge and any down payment or other deposit to be paid by the\nrecipient. (iii)\n\nIn either case, if\nthe recipient is approved for a lease financing in a stated dollar amount that\nmay be funded over multiple leases or lease schedules, then the aggregate net\ncost or price for the goods under such approval may be used to determine the\namount financed. (b) An individual commercial\nfinancing transaction in an amount over two million five hundred thousand\ndollars, as such term appears in Financial Services Law section\n802(g), means the aggregate amount that a recipient may receive under a\ncommercial financing agreement and not the amount of any particular advance\nunder such agreement. (c) Approved advance limit\nmeans the maximum advance that a\nfinancer may provide to a recipient or on the recipient's behalf in exchange\nfor assignment of outstanding, unpaid legally enforceable claims under a\nfactoring agreement, not including any previous distributions advanced to a\nrecipient or on the recipient's behalf under a factoring agreement, to the\nextent those distributions have been repaid. The approved advance limit does\nnot include reserve amounts or any other amount not advanced to the recipient\nat the time of assignment. If a factoring agreement provides that the financer\npays different maximum advances for different types of legally enforceable\nclaims, then\napproved advance limit\nmeans the total maximum\nadvance that a financer may provide to a recipient or on a recipient's behalf\nin exchange for assignment of the different types of legally enforceable\nclaims, not including any previous distributions advanced to a recipient or on\nthe recipient's behalf under the agreement, to the extent those distributions\nhave been repaid. (d) Approved credit limit\nmeans the maximum advance that a\nfinancer may provide to a recipient or on the recipient's behalf under the\nopen-end commercial financing agreement, a lease financing agreement, or asset-\nbased lending transaction agreement, not including any previous distributions\nadvanced to a recipient or on a recipient's behalf under the agreement, to the\nextent those distributions have been repaid. Where the commercial open-ended\nfinancing agreement or asset-based lending transaction agreement requires the\nfinancer to pay different maximum advances for different categories of advance\n(such as advances secured by inventory, accounts receivable, or others), approved credit limit\nmeans the total maximum advance that a\nfinancer may provide to a recipient for all categories of advance, not\nincluding any previous distributions advanced to a recipient or on the\nrecipient's behalf under the agreement, to the extent those distributions have\nbeen repaid. (e) Asset-based lending transaction\nmeans a transaction in which\nadvances are made from time to time contingent on a recipient forwarding\npayments (defined in subdivision (s) of this section) received from one or more\nthird parties for goods that the recipient has supplied or services the\nrecipient has rendered to that third party or parties. (f) At the time of extending a\nspecific offer\nfor financing under the CFDL means: (1)\nany time a specific commercial financing\noffer is quoted to a recipient. If a provider simultaneously presents multiple\nperiodic payment amounts, irregular payment amounts, or financing amounts, and\nrates, prices, or costs of financing (including, without limitation, any total\nrepayment amounts) to the recipient representing differing specific commercial\nfinancing offers and allows the recipient to select from among those options, then\nat the time of extending a specific offer\noccurs at the\ntime that the recipient selects an option. The requirement of Section 810 of\nthe CFDL that \"other metrics of financing cost are disclosed or used in the\napplication process of a commercial financing, these metrics shall not be\npresented as a rate' if they are not the annual interest rate or the annual\npercentage rate\" shall apply at all times during the application process.; however, the requirement of Section 810 of the CDFL that \"hen a provider states\na rate of finance charge or a financing amount to a recipient during an\napplication for commercial financing, the provider shall also state the rate as\nan annual percentage rate', using that term or the abbreviation APR', shall be\nin effect only upon the quotation of a specific commercial financing\noffer; (2)\nany time when a specific\noffer is quoted in writing to a recipient to change the terms of an existing\nconsummated commercial financing contract, prior to the recipient agreeing to\nthe changes, if the resulting changes to the contract would result in an\nincrease to the finance charge or annual percentage rate, regardless of whether\nthose terms were previously disclosed to the recipient (this requirement does\nnot apply to proposed terms for resolving a recipient's default on a financing\ncontract); or\n(3)\nnotwithstanding\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, any time a specific offer of\ncommercial financing is quoted to a recipient in writing in connection with\neach draw on an open-end financing agreement if: (i) draws occur at the time that a recipient\npurchases products or services from a retailer or supplier; (ii)\nthe rate or price varies based upon the\nretailer or supplier the recipient selects, or the products or services the\nrecipient purchases; and\n(iii)\nthe\nprovider chooses to provide disclosures under Section\n600.10\nrather than a disclosure\nunder Section\n600.11\nof this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding\nparagraphs (1) through (3) of this subdivision, where a provider allows a\nrecipient to select from multiple offer options or customize a financing offer, a provider must only provide the disclosure(s) for the specific offer of\ncommercial financing that the recipient elects to pursue. (g) Average\nmeans the\narithmetic mean unless otherwise stated in this Part. (h) Average monthly cost\nmeans the average total amount paid by the recipient (periodic and irregular\npayments) over the term of the contract, divided by the number of months in the\nterm of the contract.

(z) Particular payment channel or mechanism\nmeans, with respect to\nsales-based financing, the payment channel(s) or mechanism(s) that will be used\nto determine the amount of a recipient's payment or a true-up.

For the purpose of calculating recipient funds, where part of the\namount financed will be used to pay off other amounts owed by the recipient\nthat may change over time, a provider may assume that the amounts due under the\nrecipient's other obligations are the amounts due at the time the disclosure is\nprovided. (ag)\n\nRetrospective annual percentage rate\nmeans the actual annual\npercentage rate, determined after the specific financing contract has been\nfully repaid to the financer, when the dates and amounts of all payments and\nfees are known.
