The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of section 70, 71 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law), as amended by chapter 309 of the Laws of 1926, shall apply to all the reservoirs, watercourses and drainage areas tributary thereto, which serve as sources of the public water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point, Orange County, NY. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nThe term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to the intake reservoirs of the Queensboro and Popolopen brooks, to Queensboro and Nawahunta lakes and to the streams and watercourses between these lakes and the intake reservoirs of the public water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point. (2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to all the other ponds and lakes and to any spring, stream, ditch, gutter or other channel or watercourse, the waters of which when running, whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into the public water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point. (3)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind used for the temporary storage of human excreta shall be constructed, placed or maintained with its nearest point within 50 feet of any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point, except the properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant, as hereinafter set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d); provided, however, that the property on which the privy, privy vault, pit or any other receptacle intended for the deposit of human excreta is built or to be built is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance above mentioned can be obtained with the limits of such property. (2)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle, used and intended for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta and built on property which is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance named in paragraph (1) of this subdivision cannot be obtained within the limits of such property, shall be placed as far as possible from any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point and especially constructed of masonry, concrete or metal to form a watertight receptacle from which no outward percolation can take place. All receptacles referred to in this paragraph shall be so located that the tops of such receptacles shall be above the highest known water level of the reservoirs or tributary watercourses. (3)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle used for either the temporary storage or permanent deposit of human excreta within any mine or mine shaft, the drainage from which either by gravity or pumping flows directly or indirectly into any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point, shall be especially constructed of masonry, concrete or metal to form a watertight receptacle from which no outward percolation can take place and shall be so located and maintained as to effectually prevent washing of the excremental matter into any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point. (4)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit cesspool or other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta, which is not watertight, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain with 100 feet of any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Every privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for the temporary storage of human excreta located between the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distance prescribed by this paragraph, shall be arranged in such a manner that all excreta shall be received in suitable watertight receptacles and shall at all times be deposited as set forth in paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles shall be removed and the receptacles cleansed and disinfected as often as may be found necessary to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition, and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified, and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises or of the adjoining premises. (6)\n\nUnless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid receptacles shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits at a depth of not less than 12 inches below the surface of the ground and in such manner as to effectually prevent them being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance not less than 300 feet of any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point. (7)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or to the height or flow of the subsoil or surface water or other special local condition, the excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil into any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the United States Military Academy at West Point, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such places as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.
