  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1641-1.1 - General ledger accounts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nseparate general ledger shall be maintained for each State-aided project as\ndefined in Part 1640 of this Subchapter. Accounts to be maintained in the\ngeneral ledger are grouped into two major categories, as follows: 1000 category--Asset Accounts\n2000 category--Liabilities, Reserves, and\n\nCapital\n(b) In addition to\nthe accounts included in the above categories, the general ledger contains two\ncontrol accounts, as follows: Account 3000--Income Control Account\n\nAccount 4000--Expense Control Account\n(c) Within each major category, the accounts\nare further grouped by type. The chart of accounts which follows includes, of\ncourse, both the accounts which are actually to be maintained in the general\nledger and the headings for groups and subgroups of such accounts. Accounts\ndesignating group headings are not maintained in the general ledger and are\ndistinguished from the accounts to be maintained in the general ledger by\nunderlining of both the designation [sic]. In a few instances, the use of the\nsubaccounts in a group has been made optional. In such cases, the group\nheadings may be the account to be maintained in the general ledger, depending\non the option exercised. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1641-1.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
