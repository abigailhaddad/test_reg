Such conveyance is not taxable as there is no change in beneficial\nownership; (b) the conveyance by a\ncorporation to its shareholders who will hold the real property as\ntenants-in-common in the same pro rata share as they own the corporation. Such\nconveyance is not taxable as there is no change in beneficial\nownership; (c) the conveyance by a\ncorporation to its wholly-owned subsidiary, from a wholly-owned subsidiary to\nits parent, or from one wholly-owned subsidiary to another. Such conveyance is\nnot taxable to the extent that there is no change in beneficial\nownership; (d) the conveyance by a\nperson to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership. Such\nconveyance is not taxable to the extent of the grantor's interest in the\npartnership. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
