  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5320.7 - Progressive meter/display requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Progressive displays. A progressive meter\nshall be visible to all players who are playing a device that potentially might\nwin the progressive amount if the progressive jackpot combination appears, except for mystery jackpots. A player shall know that he or she is playing a\nprogressive game and not have to play the maximum bet amount to find out. The\nfollowing applies to all progressive meter displays: (1)\n\nThe progressive meter shall display the\ncurrent total of the progressive jackpot in the monetary value or credits (the\nmonetary value may vary for multi-site progressive displays). Because the\npolling cycle does cause a delay, the jackpot meter need not show precisely the\nactual monies in the progressive pool at each instance. This paragraph does not\napply to mystery jackpots. (2)\n\nIf\nthe progressive award will not doubled or tripled when won during a feature, such feature shall be indicated clearly on the display. (b) Types of updating displays. The use of\nodometer and other paced updating displays are permitted. The progressive meter\nshall display the winning value within 30 seconds of the jackpot being\nrecognized by the central system. In the case of the use of paced updating\ndisplays, the system jackpot meter shall display the winning value after the\njackpot broadcast is received from the central system. (c) Progressive display digital limitations. If a progressive meter progresses to such meter's maximum display amount, such\nmeter shall freeze and remain at the maximum value until awarded to a\nplayer. (d) Alternating displays. When applicable, it is sufficient to have progressive information displayed in\nan alternating fashion. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5320.7\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
