  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 441.182 - Internal control\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The general\nmethodology by which management is carried on within an organization; also, any\nof the numerous devices for supervising and directing an operation or\noperations generally. (b) Internal\ncontrol, a management function, is a basic factor operating in one form or\nanother in the administration of every organization, business or otherwise. Although sometimes identified with the administrative organism itself, it is\noften characterized as the nervous system that activates overall operating\npolicies and keeps them within practicable performance ranges. The principles\ncontributing to internal control are usually these: (1)\nrecognition that within every\norganizational unit there are one or more functional or action components known\nas activities, costs, or responsibility centers, or management units; (2)\ndelegated operating authority in each\norganizational unit permitting freedom of action within defined\nlimits; (3)\nthe linking of\nexpenditures--their incurrence and disposition--with specified individual\nauthority; (4)\nend product planning\nby means of (i) a budget fitted to the organizational structure and to its\nfunctional components, thus maintaining dual forward operating disciplines; and\n(ii) the adoption of standards of comparison and other performance measurements\nsuch as standard costs, quality controls and timing goals; (5)\nan accounting process that provides\norganizational and functional administrators with prompt, complete, and\naccurate information on operating performance, and comparisons with\npredetermined performance standards; (6)\nperiodic reports, consonant with\naccounting and related records, by activity heads to supervisory management; reports serving as feedbacks of informative pictures of operations, and as\ndisplays of favorable and unfavorable factors that have influenced\nperformance; (7)\ninternal check, built into operating procedures, and providing maximum protection against fraud\nand error; (8)\nfrequent\nprofessional appraisals, through internal audit, of management and its policies\nand operations generally, as a protective and constructive management service, its emphasis varying with the quality of operating policies and their\nadministration; and\n(9)\nthe\nconstruction of the above controls in such a manner as to stimulate and take\nfull advantage of those natural attributes of individual employees the\nrecognition and exercise of which may obviate the need for some internal\ncontrols and determine the extent and rigidity of others.
