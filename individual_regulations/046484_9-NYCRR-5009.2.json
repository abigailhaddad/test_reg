(e) To place a bet, a purchaser communicates\nthe desired bet data (day, amount, bet type and bet number selections) to an\nagent, who will issue a bet ticket. If desired, a purchaser may use the quick\npick option for deciding bet number selections. When the quick pick option is\nused, the bet will be entered by computer in the next scheduled drawing as a\nstraight bet in the amount of 50 cents and the numbers to be played will be\nrandomly selected by computer. A purchaser using the quick pick option may\nspecify such purchaser's own choice of drawing date (s), bet type or bet\namount. The agent enters the bet into a secure computer system via a computer\nterminal. Upon acceptance of and payment for the ticket issued by the agent, the transaction shall become binding and final. (f) The commission reserves the right at any\ntime, in the commission's sole discretion, to suspend play on any number(s) or\nto limit the number of bets made on any number(s) or combination(s). (g) At some time in the future, the\ncommission may change the daily numbers game from fixed prize payouts to\npari-mutuel payouts. If the commission determines that this change should be\nmade, it will be publicly announced in advance of the effective date. Prizes\nfor the numbers game will be determined on a pari-mutuel basis (as explained\nbelow) for a test period of at least one month. If the commission determines\nthat it is in the best interest of the players and/or the State, the commission\nmay, at the commission's discretion, return prizes to a fixed payout basis. Such change will be publicly announced in advance of the date it is effective. Up to 50 percent of the sales from each drawing will be allocated to a prize\npool for that drawing. The prize pool will be divided by the total amount bet\non the winning daily number to arrive at the base prize amount from which all\nother prizes will be calculated as shown below. The commission may, at the\ncommission's discretion, withhold up to two percent of the sales from each\ndrawing for a prize reserve fund. This reserve fund may be used to fund\npromotions and maintain minimum prize levels, if desired. Prizes for all bets\nare calculated as a percentage of the base prize amount as follows: Percentage of Base Prize for: Bet type $.50 bet $1 bet Comment Straight 50% 100% Box\nsix-way 8.33% 16.66% Box three-way 16.66% 33.33% Front pair 5.00% 10.00% Back\npair 5.00% 10.00% Straight/box six-way 116.66% n/a If straight hits 16.66% n/a\n\nIf box only Straight/box three-way 133.33% n/a If straight hits 33.33% n/a If\nbox only Combination six-way 50.00% 100.00% $.50 bet cost is $3 Combination\nthree-way 50.00% 100.00% $.50 bet cost is $1.50\n\nNote: All prizes will be rounded down to the nearest\n50-cent increment at the 50-cent payout level. The following is an example of a\ntypical payout calculation. Current sales = $910,106.00\n\nPrize pool = $455,053.00 (50% of sales)\n\nTotal bet on winning number = $603.78\n\nBase prize = $721.41 (prize pool divided by total bet on\nwinning number)\n\nPayout for: Bet type $.50 bet $1 bet Comment Straight $360.50 $721\n\nBox six-way $60.00 $120 Box three-way $120.00 $240 Front pair $36.00 $72 Back\npair $36.00 $72 Straight/box six-way $420.50 n/a If straight hits $60.00 n/a If\nbox only Straight/box three-way $480.00 n/a If straight hits $120.00 n/a If box\nonly Combination six-way $360.50 $721 $.50 bet cost is $3 Combination\nthree-way $360.50 $721 $.50 bet cost is $1.50\n(h) Lucky Sum.
