  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 2-1.2 - Calendar-year taxpayers\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(10))\n(a) A taxpayer that reports on the basis of a\ncalendar year for Federal income tax purposes must report on the same basis for\npurposes of article 9-A. A calendar year is a period of 12 calendar months\nending on December 31st, or a period of less than 12 calendar months beginning\non the date a taxpayer becomes subject to tax and ending on December 31st. A\ncalendar year also includes, in the case of a taxpayer that changes the period\non the basis of which it keeps its books from a fiscal year to a calendar year, the period from the close of its last fiscal year to and including the\nfollowing December 31st. (b) A\ntaxpayer shall use a calendar year as its accounting period and report on a\ncalendar-year basis in the following situations: (1)\nthe taxpayer keeps its books on the basis\nof a calendar year; (2)\nthe\ntaxpayer keeps its books on the basis of any period ending on any day other\nthan the last day of a calendar month, except in the case of a taxpayer that\nkeeps its books on the basis of a 52-53 week accounting period; (3)\nthe taxpayer does not keep\nbooks; (4)\nthe taxpayer is not\nrequired to file a Federal income tax return, unless the use of a fiscal year\nor 52-53 week period basis of reporting has been authorized by the\ncommissioner; or\n(5)\nthe taxpayer\nhas made no election as to the use of either a fiscal- or calendar-year basis\nof reporting. (c) Examples. The calendar-year taxpayer's first accounting period and\nits first taxable year ends on December 31, 2021 in each of the following\nexamples. The taxpayer's first report must be filed on or before April 15, 2022. Example 1: The corporation is organized in New York State\non October 22, 2021, and its certificate of incorporation is filed in the\n\nOffice of the Secretary of State on the same date. The corporation becomes\nsubject to tax on October 22, 2021, and its first accounting period and taxable\nyear begins on that date irrespective of when the corporation starts to\ntransact business. Example 2: The corporation is organized in New York State\non December 31, 2021, and its certificate of incorporation is filed in the\n\nOffice of the Secretary of State on the same day. The corporation's first\naccounting period and taxable year is one day, December 31, 2021, and the\ncorporation must file a report based on such period. Example 3: The foreign corporation, which reports for\n\nFederal income tax purposes on a calendar-year basis, leases space for an\noffice in New York City on February 5, 2021. Prior to February 5, 2021, the\ncorporation did not do business, employ capital, own or lease property, maintain an office, or derive receipts from activity in New York State. The\ncorporation hires personnel and opens its office in New York City on March 1, 2021. The corporation becomes subject to tax on February 5, 2021. Since the\ntaxpayer reports for Federal income tax purposes on a calendar-year basis, its\nfirst taxable year for purposes of article 9-A begins February 5, 2021, and its\ntax is computed on the basis of an accounting period that begins January 1, 2021, and ends December 31, 2021.
