Tit. 22 § 1015.15 - Contingent fees in claims and actions for personal injury and wrongful death\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In any claim or\naction for personal injury or wrongful death, other than one alleging medical, dental or podiatric malpractice, whether determined by judgment or settlement, in which the compensation of claimant's or plaintiffs attorney is contingent, that is, dependent in whole or in part upon the amount of the recovery, the\nreceipt, retention or sharing by such attorney, pursuant to agreement or\notherwise, of compensation which is equal to or less than that contained in any\nschedule of fees adopted by this department is deemed to be fair and\nreasonable. Unless authorized by a written order of a court as hereinafter\nprovided, the receipt, retention or sharing of compensation which is in excess\nof such scheduled fees shall constitute the exaction of unreasonable and\nunconscionable compensation in violation of the applicable provisions of the\n\nRules of Professional Conduct (section 1200.0 of this Title) or, with respect\nto conduct before April 1, 2009, the former Code of Professional\n\nResponsibility. (b) The following\nis the schedule of reasonable fees referred to in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, either: SCHEDULE A\n(1)\n50 percent on the first $1,000 of the sum\nrecovered; (2)\n40 percent on the\nnext $2,000 of the sum recovered; (3)\n35 percent on the next $22,000 of the sum\nrecovered; (4)\n25 percent on any\namount over $25,000 of the sum recovered; or\nSCHEDULE B\nA percentage not exceeding 33 &\" percent of the\nsum recovered, if the initial contractual arrangement between the client and\nthe attorney so provides, in which event the procedure hereinafter provided for\nmaking application for additional compensation because of extraordinary\ncircumstances shall not apply. Compensation of claimant's or plaintiffs attorney for\nservices rendered in claims or actions for personal injury alleging medical, dental or podiatric malpractice shall be computed pursuant to the fee schedule\ncontained in Judiciary Law, section 474-a. (c) Such percentage shall be computed by one\nof the following two methods to be selected by the client in the retainer\nagreement or letter of engagement: (1)\non the\nnet sum recovered after deducting from the amount recovered expenses and\ndisbursements for expert testimony and investigative or other services properly\nchargeable to the enforcement of the claim or prosecution of the action; or\n(2)\nin the event that the\nattorney agrees to pay costs and expenses of the action pursuant to Judiciary\n\nLaw section 488(2)(d), on the gross sum recovered before deducting expenses and\ndisbursements. The retainer agreement or letter of engagement shall describe\nthese alternative methods, explain the financial consequences of each, and\nclearly indicate the client's selection. In computing the fee, the costs as\ntaxed, including interest upon a judgment, shall be deemed part of the amount\nrecovered. For the following or similar items there shall be no deduction in\ncomputing such percentages: liens, assignments or claims in favor of hospitals, for medical care and treatment by doctors and nurses, or self-insurers or\ninsurance carriers. (d) In the event that claimant's or plaintiffs attorney believes in good faith that\nschedule A, in subdivision (b) of this section, because of extraordinary\ncircumstances, will not give the attorney adequate compensation, application\nfor greater compensation may be made upon affidavit with written notice and an\nopportunity to be heard to the client and other persons holding liens or\nassignments on the recovery. Such application shall be made to the justice of\nthe trial part to which the action had been sent for trial; or, if it had not\nbeen sent to a part for trial, then to the justice presiding at the trial term\ncalendar part of the court in which the action had been instituted; or, if no\naction had been instituted, then to the justice presiding at the trial term\ncalendar part of the Supreme Court for the county in the judicial department in\nwhich the attorney making the application has an office. Upon such application, the justice, in his or her discretion, if extraordinary circumstances are found\nto be present, and without regard to the claimant's or plaintiffs consent, may\nfix as reasonable compensation for legal services rendered an 'amount greater\nthan that specified in schedule A, in subdivision (b) of this section; provided, however, that such greater amount shall not exceed the fee fixed\npursuant to the contractual arrangement, if any, between the client and the\nattorney. If the application be granted, the justice shall make a written order\naccordingly, briefly stating the reasons for granting the greater compensation; and a copy of such order shall be served on all persons entitled to receive\nnotice of application. (e) Nothing\ncontained in this section shall be deemed applicable to the fixing of\ncompensation for attorneys representing infants or other persons, where the\nstatutes or rules provide for the fixation of such compensation by the\ncourt. (f) Nothing contained in\nthis section shall be deemed applicable to the fixing of compensation of\nattorneys for services rendered in connection with collection of first-party\nbenefits as defined in article XVIII of the Insurance Law.
