The requesting jurisdiction\ncompletes as much of the form as possible with the information it has. In addition to the more common data\nelements specified on the Locate Data Sheet, space is provided to note other\nlocate/asset information particular to the case. For example, information on\nwages, violence potential, military/veteran status, and relatives may prove\nuseful in working a case. In the interest of expediting the locate\nprocess, use CSENet whenever possible. Quick Locate. When using the Locate Data\n\nSheet to request \"quick locate\", do not attach the Locate Data Sheet to a Child\n\nSupport Enforcement Transmittal. You may send the request directly to the\nresponding State's Parent Locator Service. \"Quick locate\" is useful if a State\nbelieves that a noncustodial parent may be in one of several States, but is\nunsure of which State. If a State intends to use its long-arm jurisdiction to\nestablish or enforce an order, it may choose to use \"quick locate\" to confirm\nthe noncustodial parent's location. Using the Locate Data Sheet as Part of an\n\nInterstate Referral. Attach the Locate Data Sheet to the Child Support\n\nEnforcement Transmittal #1, and send the request to the responding State's\ncentral registry. Use of the Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #1 will\nrequire the responding State to open a IV-D case and provide services. An\ninterstate referral should be made in cases where a State is relatively sure\nthat the noncustodial parent is in a specific State. HEADING/CAPTION: Identify the petitioner and respondent in\nthe appropriate spaces. Check the appropriate space to identify\nthe type of case: IV-D Non Public Assistance; IV-D Non Public Assistance\n\nMedicaid (indicate whether receiving Full Services or Medical Services Only); IV-D Public Assistance; IV-E Foster Care; or Non IV-D. IV-D means the case is\nbeing worked by the State or local child support enforcement agency (i.e., IV-D\nagency). Public Assistance means the obligee's family receives IV-A cash\npayments [IV-A was formerly called Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AFDC) and is now called Temporary Family Assistance]. A IV-D Non Public\n\nAssistance Medicaid case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid\nbut does not receive Public Assistance (IV-A cash payments). In the space marked \"To:\", list the name\nand address (street, city, State, and zip code) of the central registry or\nagency where you are sending the Locate Data Sheet. In the appropriate spaces, if applicable\nand if known, enter the Responding jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case\nnumber, and docket number.

In the space marked \"From:\", list a\ncontact person, agency name, address (street, city, state, zip code), phone\nnumber (including extension), fax number, and Internet address. In the appropriate spaces, enter the\ninitiating jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case number, and docket\nnumber.
