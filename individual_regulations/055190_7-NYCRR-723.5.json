  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 723.5 - Inmate self-dial calling\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Description. Self-dial telephones will only handle outgoing collect telephone\ncalls within the continental United States, Canada, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto\n\nRico, Guam and Central Northern Marianna. No credit card calls may be made nor\nincoming calls received. (1)\n\nThe self-dial\nsystem is the property of the department which is responsible for its\ninstallation and maintenance. System abuse or failure to follow established\nrules and procedures may result in its removal or the imposition of\nrestrictions or limitations. Damaged hardware will be replaced or repaired at\nthe discretion of the superintendent. In cases where the damage is the result\nof vandalism, other repairs will be considered a higher priority. (2)\n\nSystem changes (moves, additions or\ndeletions) must be discussed with the Division of Management Information\n\nServices. (b) Access. (1)\n\nSystem use should not interfere with\nprogram and work assignments. (2)\n\nSystem access should be available to as many inmates as possible, but access\nmay be restricted or denied to an inmate. (3)\n\nSystem use will normally be on a \"first\ncome-first call\" basis. During peak periods such as holidays, however, it may\nbe necessary to schedule calls with \"sign-up sheets.\" A sign-in log may be\nmaintained at each telephone location at the discretion of the facility\nadministration. (4)\n\nIn order to\nassure that all inmates have fair and equal access to the facility's inmate\nself-dial telephones as well as to minimize abuses of these telephone systems, inmate self-dial telephones should be installed adjacent to, or in close\nproximity to, or in view of the regularly covered correction officer\nposts. (5)\n\nSuperintendents must\ndevelop and implement a monitoring/review system to prevent individual inmates\nor groups of inmates from monopolizing self-dial telephones. This system should\nmeet the facility's need to assure that all inmates have equal access to the\nuse of the facility's inmate telephones. (6)\n\nCall should be limited in duration based\non facility needs and will automatically terminate when the specified time\nlimit has been reached. No call shall exceed 30 minutes. When other inmates are\nwaiting to place calls, a 10- minute limit may be imposed. (7)\n\nWhen a facility-wide emergency situation\nexists, the superintendent or his designee has the authority to temporarily\nsuspend the telephone call home program. The superintendent shall immediately\nadvise the deputy commissioners for correctional facilities and program\nservices. (c) Telephone\nnumber registration list. (1)\n\nAt the reception\ncenter, the inmate's DIN number is entered into the self-dial telephone system\non the first day of arrival. The number will be activated on the department's\nsystem overnight. (2)\n\nTo establish\nthe permanent telephone list, the inmate must fill out a \"telephone form\" and\ngive it to his/her correction counselor for approval. No inmate may add any\nperson who is listed on an active court order of protection which prohibits\nsuch contacts. (i) Each inmate shall be\nlimited to 15 approved names and phone numbers which will be maintained as\nhis/her \"telephone list.\" Except for immediate family members, revisions to the\ntelephone list will only be made when the inmate is due a quarterly review. Phone number changes for immediate family members already on the list will be\npermitted. (ii)\n\nIf the inmate's\ntelephone list contains the allotted 15 names and numbers, deletions must occur\nbefore the new names and numbers may be added. If deletions are not provided by\nthe inmate, the new names and telephone numbers will not be added to the\ntelephone list. (3)\nA\ncomputer generated record including, but not limited to, the following\ninformation shall be maintained in the central office management information\nservices' data base: (i) date; (ii)\ntime; (iii)\nnumber called; (iv)\nduration of call; and\n(v) location of telephones used. (d) Calling procedure. The inmate shall access the system by utilization of an individual PIN number\nwhich is the inmate DIN number modified so that the alpha letter is converted\nto the corresponding numeral. The detailed procedures for inmate self-dial\ncalling are set forth in the departmental directive on inmate telephone calls\nwhich are located in inmate libraries and may be viewed by the public at\nwww.docs.state.ny.us under the \"Directives\" menu options, titled: \"Inmate\n\nTelephone Calls (Directive 4423).\"\n(1)\n\nTo\nplace a telephone call, the inmate picks up the telephone, waits for a dial\ntone, and dials 0 + the 10-digit telephone number. After the 10th digit is\nentered, the caller will hear a \"bong\" sound. The caller then enters his/her\nPIN number. (2)\n\nIf the phone number\nis not on the caller's list or an erroneous PIN number has been entered, the\ncaller will hear the message, \"You have dialed an unauthorized number,\" and\nwill be disconnected. (3)\n\nIf the\ntelephone number and PIN number are valid, the inmate will hear a message to\ndial \"1\" if they want English or \"2\" if they want Spanish. Another message will\nbe heard, dial \" 1\" for a station-to-station call, or dial \"2\" for a\nperson-to-person call. (4)\n\nThe\ncaller will be requested to give his/her name which is then recorded and\nincorporated into the next message. Only the inmate's name will be\nrecorded. (5)\n\nThe party called will\nbe informed: \"You have a collect call from (name stated), an inmate at a New\n\nYork State correctional facility. If you do not wish to accept the call, hang\nup now. If you accept the call, dial '55' now.\"\n(6)\n\nIf the party accepts the call, the\nconnection is made; otherwise, the call will be disconnected. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n723.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
