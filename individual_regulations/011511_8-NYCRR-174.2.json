  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 174.2 - Computation of tuition charges for nonresident pupils\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe provisions of this section shall apply to all contracts\nfor the reimbursement of a school district which provides instruction to a\nnonresident pupil. The charge for the instruction of each nonresident pupil\nshall not exceed the actual net cost of educating such pupil. If the accounting\nrecords of the school district providing such instruction are not maintained in\na manner which would indicate the net cost of educating such pupil, a board of\neducation, board of trustees or sole trustee of each school district shall\ncompute the tuition to be charged for the instruction of each nonresident pupil\nadmitted to the schools of such district, or for the education of whom such\ndistrict contracts with a board of cooperative educational services, in\naccordance with the following formulae: (a) The tuition to be charged by a school\ndistrict which provides full-day instruction for each nonresident pupil shall\nbe computed as follows: (1)\n\nThe total general\nfund appropriation shall be ascertained from the district budget for the school\nyear. The amount of such appropriation shall be reduced by the amount of the\nappropriations for transportation, including debt service for buses, adult\neducation, special schools, community services, and any other appropriations\nwhich do not benefit such student. General fund revenue and interfund revenue, as well as Federal aid which is not paid to the district on behalf of such\nnonresident pupil, shall also be deducted from such total general fund\nappropriation. (2)\n\nThe cost of\ninstruction for such pupil shall be determined on the basis of such total\ngeneral fund appropriation, as reduced in accordance with the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, which is attributable to each of the\nfollowing four categories: half-day kindergarten, full-day kindergarten through\ngrade six, grades 7 through 12, and special educational programs for pupils\nwith handicapping conditions. If the records of the school district do not\naccurately reflect the actual appropriation in each of such categories, such\ntotal general fund appropriation shall be distributed in the same proportion as\nthe cost of teachers' salaries in each category bears to the total amount of\nteachers' salaries on a district-wide basis. (3)\n\nThe net amount of State aid received by\nthe school district, as defined in this paragraph, shall be distributed among\nthe categories set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision in the same\nproportion that the average daily membership in each of such categories bears\nto the average daily membership for the school district. For the purposes of\nthis section, such average daily membership shall be computed in accordance\nwith the provisions of paragraph l of subdivision 1 of section\n3602\nof the\n\nEducation Law, except that for the purpose of this computation the enrollment\nof pupils attending under the provisions of paragraph c of subdivision 2 of\nsection\n4401\nof the\n\nEducation Law and the equivalent attendance of the school district, as computed\npursuant to paragraph d of subdivision 1 of section\n3602\nof the\n\nEducation Law, shall not be included in such computation. For the purposes of\nthis section, net State aid shall include aid received in the general fund for\noperating expenses, textbooks, experimental programs, educational television, county vocational boards and boards of cooperative educational services, building aid, and other forms of State aid as approved by the department for\ninclusion herein, but shall not include transportation aid. Net State aid shall\nalso include the sum which is withheld from the school district for payment to\nthe teacher's retirement fund. (4)\n\nThe net cost of instruction in each category shall be ascertained by\nsubtracting the State aid attributed to such category pursuant to paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision from the appropriation for such category computed in\naccordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nThe maximum nonresident pupil tuition\nwhich may be charged shall be determined by dividing the net cost of\ninstruction of pupils in each category by the estimated average daily\nmembership of pupils in each category. (6)\n\nRefunds or additional charges shall be\nmade at the conclusion of the school year based upon actual revenues, expenditures and average daily membership. (b) The tuition to be charged by a school\ndistrict for the instruction of each nonresident pupil who is enrolled in an\ninstructional program operated by a board of cooperative educational services\nshall include the tuition charged by the board of cooperative educational\nservices for such instruction, less the State aid attributable to such\nstudent's attendance at an instructional program of this nature, and the cost\nof any instruction which such district may also provide such student, to be\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (c) The tuition to be\ncharged by a school district for instruction of each nonresident pupil who is\nenrolled on a part-time basis in such district shall be computed as follows: (1)\n\nThe cost of such instruction on a\nfull-time basis shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision (a) or (b) of this section. (2)\n\nThe cost of such instruction shall be\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of class\nperiods per week in which such pupil received such instruction and the\ndenominator of which shall be the total number of class periods, not to exceed\n25, operated by the same school district during the week. (3)\n\nThe product of the computation made in\naccordance with the preceding paragraph shall be the maximum tuition which may\nbe charged. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
