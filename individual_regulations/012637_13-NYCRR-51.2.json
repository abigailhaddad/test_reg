Tit. 13 § 51.2 - Records to be kept by an issuer or other offeror of a theatrical production company\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Permanent type books and records of account shall be kept by the issuer or other offeror of each theatrical\nproduction company, with entries in ink on paper of quality suitable for maintaining a permanent record. Entries in pencil, work sheets and similar\nentries and stationery, temporary in nature, shall not be deemed adequate as permanent type books and records of account. Nothing herein shall\nprohibit the use of recordkeeping automation such as entries made by punched cards. (b) The books and\nrecords of a theatrical production company are to be organized in such a way as to fully record and clearly reflect all financial transactions, and\nwith a view to assembling information and data appropriate for financial reports to be rendered. The following constitutes the minimum basic\nrequirement for permanent type books of account to be kept (which may be combined in one volume): (1)\ncash receipts\nbook; (2)\ncash disbursement book; (3)\ngeneral\njournal; (4)\ngeneral ledger (which should include in accounts or columns: production cost distribution; weekly running income and expense distribution; and closing costs distribution); (5)\npayroll\nrecords; (6)\nhouse seat record book. (This shall record the disposition of house seats and passes\nallocated to the theatrical production company. It shall clearly indicate on a daily basis the number of house seats and passes for each performance, location and box office price thereof, the persons in the theatrical production company who are entitled to such seats and the disposition by them of\nthese seats as recorded on receipt slips signed by them. If any monies are received in excess of the box office prices for such tickets by any\nperson, such receipt should be set forth as well as a statement as to disposition of such proceeds. This record shall further indicate the location\nand dates of any house seats or passes which are not used by, or at the direction of, anyone connected with the theatrical production company and\nshall indicate whether such seats have been sold or made available for sale at the box office, through theatre ticket brokers or otherwise as well as\nthe price, if any, at which such tickets were actually sold and the disposition of the proceeds); and\n(7)\nsuch other permanent and subsidiary books and records as are necessary to permit the preparation of true, accurate and complete financial\nreports. (c) Books and records shall be kept from the start of all financial transactions\npertaining to the theatrical production company, beginning with the offering of interests in a theatrical production company, and not merely from the\ninitial expenditure of investors' funds. Records shall be kept regarding the expenditure of the funds of any principal or front money investors when\nsuch funds are to be reimbursed out of the proceeds of the offering or credited as investment units. Funds received from investors as capital\ncontributions should be entered in the books when received by the theatrical production company or the escrowee, on an individual basis including the\nentry of the investor's name and address. (d) The issuer or other offeror of each theatrical production\ncompany shall maintain and preserve or cause to be maintained and preserved in good order all permanent books of account and all subsidiary records\nand documents (including, but not necessarily consisting exclusively of, bank statements, cancelled checks, bank deposit book or duplicate deposit\nslips, and other documents relating to the bank statements, theatre settlement statements, vouchers, invoices, bills, receipts, sales slips, memoranda, schedules, summaries, contracts, instruments, tax report copies, correspondence, notes, letters, excerpts and any other pertinent and\napplicable materials) that pertain to, explain and/or support all transactions and all entries made or that should have been made. (e) The minimum basic books of account and subsidiary records and documents as described in subdivisions (b) and\n(d) of this section shall be maintained and preserved by the issuer or other offeror in good order for a period of not less than two years after the\nlast public performance of each theatrical production produced, developed or invested in by the theatrical production company or the date at which\nthe production company has lost its right to produce, develop or invest in the play or has terminated, dissolved or otherwise formally indicated\nabandonment of intent to produce, develop or invest in such play, whichever is earlier. Irrespective of the above, post-closing records accounting\nfor subsidiary rights shall be accurately maintained and preserved for a period of not less than two years after the timely making thereof.
