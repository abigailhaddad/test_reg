(b) Level of care determination. If an\nindividual is determined to meet criteria for substance use disorder\nresidential services, a level of care determination shall be made by a clinical\nstaff member who shall be provided clinical oversight by a qualified health\nprofessional. The level of care determination shall be signed and dated by the\nclinical staff member. The level of care determination shall be made promptly\nafter the individual's first on site contact with the service.

(d) Prohibition against discrimination. Individuals that meet level of care criteria for residential services, in\naccordance with this Part, may not otherwise be denied admission in accordance\nwith the provisions of Part 815 of this Title. (e) Admission criteria. To be admitted for\nresidential services, the individual must be determined to have recovery goals\nwith the application of residential services and meet the admission criteria\nidentified in this Part for the applicable level of service. (f) If the individual does not meet admission\ncriteria for residential services, unless the individual already is receiving\nsubstance use disorder treatment services from another provider, a referral to\na service that can meet the individual's treatment needs shall be made. The\nreasons for denial of any admission to the residential service must be provided\nto the individual and documented in a written record maintained by the\nresidential service. (g) There must\nbe a notation in the resident's record that they received a copy of the\nresidential service's rules and regulations, including resident rights and a\nsummary of federal confidentiality requirements, and a statement that notes\nthat such rules were discussed with the resident, and that the resident\nindicated that they understood them. (h) All prospective residents shall be\ninformed that admission is on a voluntary basis and that a resident shall be\nfree to discharge themselves from the service at any time. For prospective\nresidents under an external mandate, the potential consequences for premature\ndischarge shall be explained, including that the external mandate does not\nalter the voluntary nature of admission and continued treatment. This provision\nshall not be construed to preclude or prohibit attempts to persuade a resident\nto remain in the service in their own best interest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
