If the\nhearing officer needs to be replaced and the parties fail to notify the\ncommissioner of their mutually agreed upon replacement within two business\ndays, the commissioner shall select the replacement.

Upon request, the hearing officer shall\narrange for the preparation and delivery of one copy of the record of the\nhearing to each panel member, to the employee and the board. (i) The hearing officer or hearing panel\nshall render a written decision within 30 days of the last day of the final\nhearing, or within 10 days of the last day of an expedited hearing and shall\nforthwith forward a copy to the commissioner, in a manner prescribed by the\ncommissioner, who shall send copies to the parties and/or their designated\nattorneys.
