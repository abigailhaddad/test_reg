  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.2 - Executive Order No. 2: Appointing a commissioner to investigate public agencies supervising nursing care facilities and the operation of such facilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen public funds are channeled through private hands to\nfinance health and residential services, government must insure that those\nfunds are used honestly and efficiently in the promotion of the public welfare. The compassionate purpose of programs of residential and health care must not\nbe subverted by the improper diversion of public funds for private benefit, nor\nthrough the inability of government to control the use of such funds under\npresent regulatory structures. A serious public concern has been expressed as to the\nquality of care provided by nursing homes and residential facilities sheltering\nthe aged, the disabled, the mentally ill and retarded, receiving public\nfinancial assistance and subject to supervision by State agencies, but owned by\nprivate interests. State government is deeply involved in the supervision of\nsuch facilities, but the public has lost confidence in the methods through\nwhich government finances these facilities, and in the government's ability to\nassure the efficient delivery of health and related services. It is necessary, therefore, that there be an official\ninquiry into the mechanisms of State and Federal funding, particularly\nreimbursement under the Medicaid system. Current methods of funding must be\nevaluated to determine if they contribute to exploitation of the poor, aged, and infirm and to profiteering in public funds. In addition, the State regulatory structure must be\nevaluated to insure that nursing homes and homes which shelter the aged and\ndisabled provide the highest quality of care with the greatest degree of\neconomy. This inquiry must also look into the ownership, financing\nand control of nursing homes and residential facilities and must thoroughly\nexamine any allegations of improper conduct by publicly elected officials or\nmembers of their staffs with respect to the operation of State agencies charged\nwith the responsibility of regulating these institutions. Now, therefore, I, Hugh L. Carey, pursuant to Section\n\nSix\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, have appointed and by these present do appoint Morris B. Abram\nas Commissioner to study, examine, investigate, review and make recommendations\nwith respect to the management and affairs of any department, board, bureau, or\ncommission of the State exercising any direction, supervision, visitation, inspection, funding or control of any nongovernmental nursing home, residential\nfacility or home which provides health, residential or allied services, and\nwhich receives any Federal, State or local financial assistance or payment, directly or indirectly, or which provides care or services to any individual\nwho receives such assistance or payment. The Commissioner is hereby empowered to subpoena and\nenforce the attendance of witnesses, to administer oaths and examine witnesses\nunder oath and to require the production of any books, records or papers deemed\nrelevant or material and I hereby give and grant to the Commissioner the powers\nand authorities which may be given or granted to persons appointed by me for\nsuch purpose under authority of Section\n\nSix\nof the\n\nExecutive Law. Every State department, division, board, bureau, commission, council and agency shall provide to the Commissioner every\nassistance, facility and cooperation which may be proper or desirable for the\naccomplishment of the purposes for which the Commissioner is hereby\nappointed. Signed: Hugh L. Carey\n\nDated: January 10, 1975\n\nExecutive Order No. 2.1\n\nPursuant to Section\n\nSix\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, I hereby appoint Peter A.A. Berle, Isadore Rossman, Dorothy B. Wadsworth, and Aminda Wilkins, as Commissioners, to join with Morris B. Abram, previously appointed as Commissioner by Executive Order No. 2, dated January\n10, 1975, generally to study, examine, investigate, review and make\nrecommendations with respect to the management and affairs of any department, board, bureau or commission of the State exercising any direction, supervision, visitation, inspection, funding or control of any nongovernmental nursing home, residential facility or home which provides health, residential or allied\nservices, and which receives any Federal, State or local financial assistance\nor payment, directly or indirectly, or which provides care or services to any\nindividual who receives such assistance or payment. Morris B. Abram is hereby designated Chairman, and the\n\nCommissioners are hereby empowered to subpoena and enforce the attendance of\nwitnesses, to administer oaths and examine witnesses under oath and to require\nthe production of any books, records or papers deemed relevant or material and\nI hereby give and grant to the Commissioners all and singular powers and\nauthorities which may be given or granted to persons appointed by me for such\npurpose under authority of section\nsix\nof the\n\nExecutive Law. Every State department, division, board, bureau, commission, council and agency shall provide to the Commissioners every\nassistance, facility and cooperation which may be proper or desirable for the\naccomplishment of the purposes for which the Commissioners have been\nappointed.
