Tit. 10 §§ 58-5.7 - Hematopoietic progenitor cell processing facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If hematopoietic progenitor cells are to be frozen, the following requirements apply: (1)\nunless otherwise specifically authorized in writing by the director of the hematopoietic progenitor cell processing facility, hematopoietic progenitor cells shall be frozen within 48-hours of collection using cryopreservation techniques generally accepted by experts in transplantation medicine and meeting the requirements of this Subpart; (2)\nuntil used, hematopoietic progenitor cells shall be stored continuously within a temperature range of minus 196° C to minus 80° C, under one of the following conditions: (i) in a mechanical freezer reserved for hematopoietic progenitor cells, equipped with an automatic temperature recording device, an audible alarm and a back-up system in the event of unexpected mechanical failure; or\n(ii)\nin a liquid nitrogen freezer reserved for hematopoietic progenitor cells, equipped with an automatic liquid nitrogen level monitor, an audible alarm and a back-up system in the event of unexpected liquid nitrogen loss; (3)\nfrozen hematopoietic progenitor cells in transit from a processing facility to a transplantation facility or other facility shall be: (i) maintained, at a minimum, on dry ice or in a liquid nitrogen dry shipper. Storage/transport procedures for the frozen hematopoietic progenitor cells shall be validated, and such validation shall be documented; (ii)\ntransported as fast as reasonably possible and without any unnecessary delay; and\n(iii)\nused immediately upon arrival or stored as required in paragraph (2) of this subdivision until thawed for use; and\n(4)\nhematopoietic progenitor cell specimens shall be inspected visually at the time of freezing and thawing. If the color or physical appearance is abnormal, the cells shall not be released for transplantation unless authorized, in writing, by the transplantation service director. (b) Hematopoietic progenitor cells stored in the liquid state shall be maintained at a temperature and for a period of time specified in a protocol approved by the director of the hematopoietic progenitor cell procurement service and/or processing facility. (c) Storage temperature records for hematopoietic progenitor cells shall be maintained as required in section\n58-5.8\n(c) and (d)\nof this Subpart, and be made available for inspection by the department for the entire period of storage and for one year afterward. (d) Unless needed to meet a medical emergency, hematopoietic progenitor cells shall be transported in a leak-resistant, crush-resistant and puncture-resistant container featuring a prominent label which: (1)\nidentifies the contents as \"human blood,\" \"human hematopoietic progenitor cells\" or \"human bone marrow\"; (2)\ndescribes the contents, the packing agent, if any, and any special precautions necessary in handling such contents; and\n(3)\ncontains the name, address and 24-hour telephone number of the person or entity to be contacted in the event that the container is found leaking or damaged, or is misdirected.
