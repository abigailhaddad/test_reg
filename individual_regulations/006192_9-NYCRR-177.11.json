Tit. 9 § 177.11 - Staff protection\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the protection of employees, the following rules shall\napply: (a) When an employee is or may\nbe the subject of an investigation which might lead to employee disciplinary\naction or criminal prosecution, he/she may choose not to speak to the\nombudsman. (b) Ombudsman's reports\nmay not be placed in an employee's personal history file or referred to\ntherein. (c) An employee who has\nbeen accused by a resident, another employee or any interested party of\nviolating a youth's legal rights, may request the ombudsman to investigate the\naccusation, and the ombudsman shall advise the facility or program director of\nsuch request.

Whenever a complaint or\ngrievance is cited in a report and that complaint or grievance is found to have\nno basis in fact, the report should so state. If the investigation of the\ncomplaint or grievance is incomplete at the time it is first reported, a\nsubsequent report shall recite the complaint or grievance and clearly state\nthat it was found to have no basis in fact. The employee shall be identified in\nthe report only if he/she had been identified in a previous report. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
