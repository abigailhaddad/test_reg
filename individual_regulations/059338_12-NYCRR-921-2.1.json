  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 921-2.1 - Notice, generally\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General rule. Subject to the exceptions set forth elsewhere in this Part, no\nemployer may order a mass layoff, plant closing, relocation, or a covered\nreduction in work hours covered by this rule unless, at least 90 calendar days\nbefore such order takes effect, the employer provides notice in compliance with\nthe requirements set forth below. When all employees are not terminated on the\nsame date, the date of the first individual termination shall trigger the\n90-day notice requirement. The first and each subsequent group of employees\nearmarked for termination are entitled to a full 90 days' notice. (b) Where an employer has sold all or part of\na business, the selling employer shall be responsible for providing notice for\nany plant closing, mass layoff, relocation or a covered reduction in hours\nconnected with such sale to any affected employees in accordance with this\nsection, up to and including the effective date of the sale. After the\neffective date of the sale of all or part of the employer's business, the\npurchasing employer shall be responsible for providing notice to any affected\nemployees included in such sale for any plant closing, mass layoff, or a\ncovered reduction in hours. Any individual who is an employee of the selling\nemployer as of the effective date of the sale and who is included in such sale\nshall be considered an employee of the purchasing employer immediately after\nthe effective date of this sale. A promise of employment by the purchasing\nemployer to an employee does not relieve the selling employer of the obligation\nto provide notice. If the transfer of employees is a good faith condition of\nthe purchase agreement, and that condition is not upheld by the purchasing\nemployer, the purchasing employer is obligated to provide notice and the\nselling employer is relieved of such obligation. (c) Where a consolidation of all or part of a\nbusiness is accompanied by an employment loss, the original business entity is\nresponsible for providing required notice. If employees are employed at the\nconsolidated business for one day or more at the time notice would become due, the new business entity is responsible for notice. (d) Where a merger is accompanied by an\nemployment loss, the original business entity is responsible for providing\nrequired notice. If employees are employed at the merged business for one day\nor more at the time notice would become due, the new merged business entity is\nresponsible for notice; therefore, as of the date of the merger, the merged\nentity is the employer for all employees who worked for the employers involved\nin the merger. (e) Scope of\nemployment action. In deciding whether notice is required the employer: (1)\n\nShall look ahead 30 days and behind 30\ndays to determine whether employment actions both taken and planned will, in\nthe aggregate, for any 30-day period, reach the minimum numbers for a plant\nclosing or a mass layoff and thus trigger the notice requirement; (2)\n\nShall look ahead 90 days and behind 90\ndays from the date of each employment action to determine whether actions\nconstituting employment losses within the meaning of this Part, both taken and\nplanned, each of which separately is not of sufficient size to trigger the\nnotice requirement will in the aggregate, for any 90-day period, reach the\nminimum standards to trigger the notice requirement for a plant closing, mass\nlayoff, relocation, or covered reduction in work hours; and\n(3)\n\nShall not aggregate employees previously\ngiven notice pursuant to the 30-day look ahead/look behind period with other\nemployees suffering employment losses during a given 90-day period in order to\nrequire that notice be given to the employees who would not otherwise be\ncovered. (f) Notice must\nbe specific. (1)\n\nThe information in the\nnotice shall be based on the best information available to the employer at the\ntime the notice is served. (2)\n\nWhere voluntary notice which does not contain all the required elements set\nforth in this Rule has been given more than 90 days in advance to any party for\nwhom notice is required, the employer must ensure that all of the information\nrequired by the Act and this Part is provided at least 90 days in advance of\nthe plant closing, mass layoff, relocation, or covered reduction in work hours. (3)\n\nNotice may be given\nconditional upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event only when the\nevent is definite and the consequences of its occurrence or non-occurrence will\nnecessarily, in the normal course of business, lead to a plant closing, mass\nlayoff, relocation, or covered reduction in work hours. For example, if the\nnon-renewal of a major contract will lead to the closing of a plant that\nproduces the articles supplied under the contract 30 days after the contract\nexpires, the employer may give notice at least 90 days in advance of the\nprojected closing date which states that if the contract is not renewed, the\nplant closing will occur on the projected date. (4)\n\nAn employer eligible for a reduction in\nnotice required under this Rule pursuant to the provisions of Subpart 921.6\nshall include with its notice a statement of the reasons for reducing the\nnotice provided and a factual explanation of the basis for claiming entitlement\nto such reduced notice period. (g) Voluntary notice. An employer is\nencouraged to voluntarily provide notice of employment losses to employees and\nto the Commissioner of Labor even if such notice is not required under the Act\nor this Part.
