  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 408.7 - Standards of payment for programs for victims of domestic violence\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Submission of forms and reports; penalty. (1)\n\nPrograms operated by not-for-profit\ncorporations providing domestic violence services must submit to the department\nthe fiscal, programmatic and statistical reports and information relating to\nthe standards and costs of providing residential care and services to victims\nof domestic violence and their children required by the department on such\nforms or in such a manner as the department may, from time to time, require. Such forms and records must be submitted to the department by April 15th of\neach year by residential programs located outside New York City and by October\n15th of each year by residential programs located in New York City. Programs\nwhich submit completed forms and reports to the department will be notified in\nwriting by the department if such forms or reports must be clarified or\nsupplemented. A program which is so notified will be given an additional 30\ncalendar days from the date of notice by the department to submit the corrected\nforms or reports. A program which does not submit the required forms and\nreports, submits part but not all of the required forms and reports, or fails\nto clarify or supplement the forms and reports as requested by the department\nby the applicable date will be deemed to have failed to meet the submittal\ndeadline and will be subject to a reduction of the administrative component of\nthe per diem rate for the program's next fiscal year as specified in this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nIf a program is unable to\nmeet the applicable deadline for a good cause, the program may request an\nextension of up to 30 days in which to submit the required fiscal, programmatic\nand statistical forms and reports. This request must be submitted in writing to\nthe department prior to the applicable deadline, and must include an\nexplanation of why the extension is needed. For good cause shown, the\ndepartment may grant an extension of up to 30 days. If there are unusual\ncircumstances which are beyond the control of the program and which justify the\nextension, the department may grant additional 30 day extensions until the\nprogram is able to submit the required forms and reports. The department will\nnotify the program in writing of any extension granted pursuant to this\nparagraph. (3)\n\nThose programs which\nfail to submit the required forms and reports in a timely fashion, or fail to\nrespond within 30 days to a written request from the department for clarifying\nor supplemental information on any forms or reports already submitted, will be\nassessed a penalty. Such penalty will result in a reduction of the\nadministrative component of the approved per diem rate beginning on the first\nday of the fiscal year for which the new rate applies and ending on the date in\nthe same fiscal year, determined in accordance with the following schedule: Days late\n\nPercentage reduction of administrative\ncomponent of the approved per diem rate\n\nEnding date of reduced rate for domestic\nviolence programs outside New York City\n\nEnding date of reduced rate for domestic\nviolence programs in New York City\n16-30 days\n5 percent\n\nJan. 15th\n\nJuly 15th\n31-45 days\n10 percent\n\nFeb. 1st\n\nAug. 1st\n46-60 days\n20 percent\n\nFeb. 15th\n\nAug. 15th\n61-90 days\n25 percent\n\nMarch 1st\n\nSept. 1st\n91-180 days\n30 percent\n\nMarch 1st\n\nSept. 1st\n181-270 days\n35 percent\n\nMarch 1st\n\nSept. 1st\n271-365 days\n45 percent\n\nMarch 1st\n\nSept. 1st\n365 +\n50 percent\n\nMarch 1st\n\nSept. 1st\n(4)\n\nFor those programs which are granted an\nextension by the department pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the\ncalculation of the number of days the documentation is late will commence on\nthe next business day following the expiration of the extension. For those\nprograms which receive a written request from the department for clarifying or\nsupplemental information pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the\ncalculation of the number of days the documentation is late will commence on\nthe 31st day after the date of such written request if the requested material\nis not submitted before the end of any extension period granted by the\ndepartment. If the due date falls on a weekend or holiday, the calculation of\nthe number of days the documentation is late will commence on the next business\nday. Every calendar day after the date the calculation commences will be\ncounted when determining the total number of days that a program is late in\nsubmitting the required documentation to the department. The total number of\ndays beyond the date authorized for submitting required reports or forms\npursuant to this Part or the date authorized for submitting clarifying or\nsupplemental information will be considered in establishing the total number of\nlate days and the amount of the penalty. (b) Reimbursement will not be made by the\ndepartment to a social services district for payments for care in a residential\nprogram for victims of domestic violence operated by a not-for-profit\ncorporation and licensed by the department until the department has promulgated\nan approved per diem rate for that program. (c) General requirements. (1)\n\nThe department will establish an approved\nper diem rate for each licensed residential program for victims of domestic\nviolence operated by a not-for-profit corporation. This rate will apply to any\nsocial services district financially responsible for a victim of domestic\nviolence residing in the program. The per diem rate, which is not negotiable, will be: (i) based upon the reasonable\noperating expenses of the residential program, including the costs of complying\nwith the standards set forth in Parts 452-455 of this Title; and\n(ii)\nsubject to the approval of the director\nof the budget. (2)\n\nFor\npurposes of establishing a per diem rate, for residential programs located\noutside of New York City, the fiscal year will be January 1st -December 31st. For residential programs located in New York City, the fiscal year will be July\n1st - June 30th. (d) Rate methodology. (1)\n\nOnly the\nfollowing items, as described in forms and instructions provided by the\ndepartment, are allowable costs for purposes of determining an approved per\ndiem rate: (i) Salary expenses: (a) administrative; (b) program/support; and\n(c) maintenance.; (ii)\n\nFringe benefits and payroll taxes: (a) social security; (b) insurance - life/health; (c) pension and retirement; (d) Workers' Compensation/Unemployment/NYS\nDisability; and\n(e) vacation\naccruals. (iii)\n\nProperty\nexpenditures; (a) rental leases (including\nfurnishings, equipment and vehicles); (b) utilities; (c) supplies and equipment; (d) repair and maintenance of plant, equipment and vehicles; (e) use\ncharges (depreciation of capital expenditures); and\n(f) taxes. (iv)\n\nManagement expenditures: (a) telephone; (b) postage; (c) dues/licenses/permits; (d) office supplies; (e) subscriptions/publications; (f) conference expenses; (g) administrative expenses; (h) staff development; (i) publicity; (j) audit/legal and advisory fees; (k) insurance; (l) interest expenses; and\n(m) charges from parent\norganization. (v) Other: (a) transportation and staff\nexpenses; (b) recreational and\nsocial activities for children; (c) purchase of services; (d) food; (e) clothing; and\n(f) bedding/linen. (2)\n\nCosts used in determining per\ndiem rates may be reduced by the amount of any government grants, including\ngrants from the department, awarded to a residential program pursuant to\narticle 6-A of the Social Services Law. (3)\n\nOptional services provided pursuant to\n\nParts 454 and 455 of this Title and staffing levels which exceed the minimum\nstandards set forth in Parts 453, 454 and 455 of this Title may be included in\nthe calculations when determining an approved per diem rate. (4)\n(i) The\nreasonableness of the allowable costs will be determined by the department\nwhich will take into account factors including, but not limited to: (a) a comparison of costs incurred by similar\nprograms; and\n(b) an evaluation of\nhistorical program operating costs incurred by the program. (ii)\n\nThe reasonableness of\nproperty costs will be limited as follows: (a) Related party transactions. Actual costs for rentals of land, building and\nequipment and other personal property owned or controlled by organizations or\npersons affiliated with the residential program or owned or controlled by\nmembers, directors, trustees, officers or other key personnel of such\nresidential program or their families either directly or through corporations, trusts or other similar arrangements in which they hold more than 10 percent\ninterest in such land, building and equipment or an interest valued at $1,000\nor more, whichever is less, are allowable only to the extent that such costs do\nnot exceed the costs the residential program would have incurred had legal\ntitle to the rented items or facilities been vested in it. (b) Actual charges in the nature of rent\nbetween or among organizations under common control are allowable to the extent\nsuch charges do not exceed the normal costs of ownership, such as depreciation, taxes, insurance and maintenance; provided that no part of such costs duplicate\nany other allowed costs. (c) Nonrelated party transaction. Rental costs of land, building and equipment and\nother personal property are allowable if the rates are reasonable in light of\nsuch factors as rental costs of comparable facilities and market conditions in\nthe area; the type, life expectancy, condition and value of the facilities\nleased; options available; and other provisions of the rental agreement. Applications of these factors, in situations where rentals are extensively\nused, may involve among other considerations, comparison of rental costs with\nthe costs which the residential program would have incurred had it owned the\nfacilities. (d) Sales/leaseback\ntransactions. Rental costs specified in a sale and leaseback agreement incurred\nby a residential program by selling facilities to an investment organization, such as an insurance company, associate institution or private investor and\nconcurrently leasing back the same facilities, are allowable only to the extent\nthat such rentals do not exceed the costs which the residential program would\nhave incurred had it retained legal title to the facilities.
