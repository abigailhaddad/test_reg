  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 119.2 - Allocating fiduciary adjustment among estate or trust and its beneficiaries\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 619(c)\n(a) General rule. Ordinarily the New York fiduciary adjustment is allocated\namong an estate or trust and its beneficiaries in proportion to their\nrespective shares of the distributable net income of the estate or trust. Distributable net income\nmeans distributable net income as\ndefined in the Internal Revenue Code. It should be noted that the Federal\ndistributable net income of an estate or trust is not the same as the Federal\ntaxable income of an estate or trust; the amount of Federal distributable net\nincome appears as a separate item on the Federal fiduciary income tax\nreturn. (1)\n\nAllocation of the fiduciary\nadjustment of a resident estate or trust is made in this way regardless of\nwhether any or all of the beneficiaries are residents or nonresidents of New\n\nYork State. A resident beneficiary, in preparing his own New York State\npersonal income tax return, uses his share of the fiduciary adjustment as a\nmodification of Federal adjusted gross income in computing his New York\nadjusted gross income as provided in section\n112.4\nof this Article. A nonresident beneficiary does not do this; instead, in\ncomputing his New York adjusted gross income, he must include his share of net\nchange from New York State sources from an estate or trust as provided in\nsection\n132.1\nof this Title. Nevertheless, a proportionate share of the fiduciary adjustment\nmust be allocated to the nonresident beneficiary in order that the shares\nallocated to the estate or trust and its resident beneficiaries will be\nproportionate to their shares of Federal distributable net income. (2)\n\nAllocation of the fiduciary adjustment\naccording to the general rule stated in paragraph (1) of this subdivision is\nillustrated by the following example: Example: The New York fiduciary adjustment with respect to a\nresident estate, computed in accordance with section\n119.1\nof this Part, is a plus figure of $1,000. The estate has Federal distributable\nnet income of $5,000, out of which it distributes $3,000 to A, a resident\nbeneficiary, and $1,500 to B, a nonresident beneficiary. A's share is 60\npercent of Federal distributable net income, so that 60 percent of the\nfiduciary adjustment ($600) is allocated to him, and on his New York State\npersonal income tax return he must add this to his Federal adjusted gross\nincome in determining his New York adjusted gross income. B's share of the\ndistributable net income is 30 percent, so that 30 percent of the New York\nfiduciary adjustment ($300) is allocated to him even though he will not use\nthis figure in computing his New York taxable income because he is a\nnonresident. Ten percent of the distributable net income was not distributed by\nthe estate to any beneficiary so that 10 percent of the fiduciary adjustment\n($100) is allocated to the estate, and the fiduciary on the estate's New York\n\nState fiduciary return must add this amount to the Federal taxable income of\nthe estate in determining its New York taxable income. (b) Special rule where\nestate or trust has no distributable net income. If the distributable net income of an estate or trust for\nthe taxable year is zero or a negative amount, the share of each beneficiary in\nthe New York fiduciary adjustment is in proportion to his share of the income\nof the estate or trust for the taxable year, determined under local law or the\ngoverning instrument, which is required to be distributed currently, and any\nother amounts which are properly paid or credited or required to be distributed\nduring the taxable year. Any balance of the fiduciary adjustment not allocable\nto any beneficiary is allocated to the estate or trust. Example 1: A trust has income, for trust accounting purposes, amounting to $10,000. The New York fiduciary adjustment with respect to the\ntrust is a plus figure of $5,000. Certain expenses paid by the trustee are\nchargeable to principal under the terms of the trust but are nevertheless\ndeductible for Federal income tax purposes and have the effect of reducing\ndistributable net income to zero. The trust instrument requires that $4,000 of income be\ndistributed to A. An additional $3,000 is paid to A pursuant to the\ndiscretionary authority of the trustee, and the remaining $3,000 of income is\naccumulated by the trust. A's $7,000 share is 70 percent of the total income\nfor trust accounting purposes, so that 70 percent of the fiduciary adjustment\n($3,500) is allocated to him. If he is a resident, he must add this amount to\nhis Federal adjusted gross income in determining his New York adjusted gross\nincome, as provided in section\n112.4\nof this Article. The remaining $1,500 is the trust's share in the fiduciary\nadjustment, which must be added to the Federal taxable income of the trust in\ndetermining its New York taxable income, as provided in section\n118.4\nof this Article. Example 2: The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the\nfiduciary adjustment is a minus figure of $5,000. In computing his New York\nadjusted gross income, the beneficiary may therefore subtract $3,500, which is\nhis share in the fiduciary adjustment, from his Federal adjusted gross income, and the trust may subtract $1,500, its share of the fiduciary adjustment, from\nits Federal taxable income.
