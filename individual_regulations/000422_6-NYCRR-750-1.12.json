  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 750-1.12 - Public notification of discharges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person possessing a SPDES permit\nwhich allows the discharge of wastewater into the surface waters of the State\nshall post a sign as provided for in subdivision (b) of this section at all\ndischarge points to surface waters, except for those sites where the discharge\nis composed exclusively of stormwater or those sites for which the requirements\nof this section have been waived in accordance with subdivision (e) or (f) of\nthis section. (b) (1)\n\nAll SPDES permittees who discharge to\nsurface waters shall erect or post a conspicuous and legible sign of not less\nthan 18 inches by 24 inches bearing the following statement: \"N.Y.S. Permitted\n\nDischarge Point Permit No. (insert SPDES permit number here). For information\non this discharge you can contact: (insert contact information here).\" The sign\nshall also contain the following information: The SPDES permit number as issued\nby the department; the name and telephone number of the permittee that shall be\nthe business office repository of the permittee as required by this section; and the name, address and telephone number of the regional office in which the\ndischarge is located. (2)\n\nThe\npermittee shall provide for public review at the business office repository of\nthe permittee or at the off-premises location of its choice, provided the\ncustodian of the off-premise location grants written permission, (such\noff-premise location shall be the village, town, city or county clerk's office, local library or other location accessible by the public) all the discharge\nmonitoring reports (DMR) prepared by the permittee to demonstrate compliance\nwith the SPDES permit conditions. A copy of each DMR shall be placed on file at\nsuch location at the same time it is sent to the department, or within 60 days\nof preparation for DMRs not required to be submitted to the department. This\ninformation shall be kept on file for the period of five years. (c) The actual appearance of the\nsign shall be as established in the SPDES permit and the location of the sign\non the property of the permittee shall be in as close proximity to the point of\ndischarge into the surface waters as is reasonably possible while ensuring the\nmaximum visibility from the surface water and shore. (d) It shall be the responsibility of the\npermittee to periodically and reasonably maintain the sign to ensure that it is\nstill legible, visible and factually correct. A good faith documented effort by\npermittee to maintain such sign will be an affirmative defense for its\nabsence. (e) The permittee may\napply to the department for a waiver from the requirements of this section, under any of the following subjective circumstances: (1)\nsuch a sign cannot reasonably be\nmaintained; (2)\nsuch a sign would\nbe inconsistent with the provisions of another statute; (3)\nsuch a sign could not be so located as to\nprovide a public purpose; (4)\nthe\nnature of the discharge is temporary and of a relatively short duration; or\n(5)\nthe authorization to\ndischarge is under a general permit. (f) For dischargers that are not major, significant facilities, the department may also choose to include permit\nprovisions that allow for all the requirements of this section, including sign\nand repository requirements, to be waived under any of the following objective\ncircumstances if the department is previously notified in accordance with\nsubdivision (g) of this section: (1)\nsuch sign\nwould be inconsistent with any other State or Federal statute; (2)\nwhen this Part would require that such\nsign be located in an area that is damaged by ice or flooding during a one-year\nstorm, or less severe storms; (3)\nthat the outfall to the receiving water is located on private or government\nproperty, which is restricted to the public through fencing, patrolling, or\nother control mechanisms. Property that is posted only, without additional\ncontrol mechanisms, does not qualify for this provision; (4)\nthe outfall pipe or channel discharges to\nanother outfall pipe or channel, before discharge to a receiving\nwater; (5)\nthe discharge from the\noutfall is located in the receiving water at a distance 200 or more feet from\nthe shoreline of the receiving water; or\n(6)\nthe discharge to the receiving water\nwould be a temporary discharge of less than one-year duration. (g) If the department chooses to\ninclude the waiver criteria listed in subdivision (f) of this section in a\npermit, and the permittee believes that any outfall that discharges wastewater\nfrom the permitted facility meets any of those criteria, the permittee must\nprovide written notification to the department of such fact, and, provided the\ndepartment does not object, a sign for the involved outfall(s) is not required. This notification must include the facility's name, address, telephone number, contact, permit number, outfall number(s), and reason why such outfall(s) is\nwaived from the requirements of discharge notification. The department may\nevaluate the applicability of a waiver at any time, and take appropriate\nmeasures to assure that the ECL and this section are complied with. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
