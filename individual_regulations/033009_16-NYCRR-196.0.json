(d) Each\nmunicipality shall prepare and file in triplicate with the commission not later\nthan six months after the effective date of this uniform system of accounts, summary statements showing: (1)\n\nThe closing\nbalance of each balance sheet account under the system of accounts followed\nprior to the adoption of the system of accounts prescribed herein, the title of\neach account under this system of accounts to which any portion thereof was\ntransferred, and the amount so transferred, and (2) the opening balance of each\naccount under this system of accounts, the title of each account from which any\nportion thereof was transferred, and the amount so transferred.

(e) Each municipality shall immediately\nproceed to redistribute the balances in its fixed capital accounts so as to\nbring the classification of such property into conformity with the operating\nproperty or other accounts prescribed in this system of accounts. Summary\nstatements of the journal entries necessary for such redistribution shall be\nfiled with the commission in triplicate not later than six months after the\neffective date of this uniform system of accounts.

(f) In prescribing this system of accounts, the commission does not commit itself to the approval or acceptance of any item\nset out in any account, for the purpose of fixing rates or in determining other\nmatters before the commission. The prescribed system of accounts is designed to\nset out the facts in connection with the financing, construction, income, expenditures, and transactions between the electric utility and the\nmunicipality itself or any other department thereof, etc., and therefrom the\ncommission will determine, in connection with such matters as may be under\nadvisement from time to time, just what consideration shall be given to the\nvarious items in the several accounts.
