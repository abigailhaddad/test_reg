  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 97.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purposes of this Part, the following definitions\nshall apply: (a) Interruption. An\ninterruption is the loss of service for five minutes or more, for one or more\ncustomers, which is the result of one or more component failures. For example, a downed house service is one interruption; a burned 69 kV tap that results in\noutages of several 13 kV primary and branch circuits that in turn cause service\ninterruptions in one interruption; one disconnected hot leg of a tri-plex house\nservice, i.e., a \"half-light\" condition, is one interruption. (b) Component. A component is a piece of\nequipment, a line, a section of line, or a group of items which is an entity\nfor purposes of reporting, analyzing and predicting interruptions. (c) Major storm. A major storm is a period of\nadverse weather during which service interruptions affect at least 10 percent\nof the customers in an operating area and/or result in customers being without\nelectric service for durations of at least 24 hours. (d) Customer. A customer is any electrical\nservice point for which a separate bill is rendered (i.e., each meter\nrepresents a customer). (e) Duration. Duration (reported in customer-hours) is the five-minute or greater\nperiod from the initiation of an interruption to a customer until service has\nbeen restored to that customer. Total duration is the sum of the durations in\nthat period. Sufficient data should be kept on each interruption to be able to\nexpress the duration in customer minutes. (f) Customers affected. A customer is\naffected by an interruption if that customer' s electrical service is\ninterrupted. (g) Average number of\ncustomers served. The average number of customers served shall be the number of\nactive metered customer accounts as of the last day of the prior year or the\nlast day of the prior month for which electric sales revenue would be recorded\nunder Uniform System of Accounts 440, 442, 445, 446 and 448.
