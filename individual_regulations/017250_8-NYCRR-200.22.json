  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 200.22 - Program standards for behavioral interventions\n\nState Regulations\n\nBehavioral interventions for students with disabilities\nshall be provided in accordance with this section and those other applicable\nprovisions of this Part and/or Part 201 that are not inconsistent with this\nsection. (a) Assessment of student\nbehaviors. For purposes of this section, an\nassessment of\nstudent behaviors\nshall mean a functional behavioral assessment (FBA), as such term is defined in section\n200.1\n(r) of this\n\nPart. (1)\nA FBA shall be conducted as\nrequired in section\n200.4\nof this Part and section\n201.3\nof this Title. (2)\n\nThe FBA shall, as appropriate, be based\non multiple sources of data including, but not limited to, information obtained\nfrom direct observation of the student, information from the student, the\nstudent's teacher(s) and/or related service provider(s), a review of available\ndata and information from the student's record and other sources including any\nrelevant information provided by the student's parent. The FBA shall not be\nbased solely on the student's history of presenting problem\nbehaviors. (3)\n\nThe FBA shall\nprovide a baseline of the student's problem behaviors with regard to frequency, duration, intensity and/or latency across activities, settings, people and\ntimes of the day and include the information required in section\n200.1\n(r) of this\n\nPart in sufficient detail to form the basis for a behavioral intervention plan\nfor the student that addresses antecedent behaviors, reinforcing consequences\nof the behavior, recommendations for teaching alternative skills or behaviors\nand an assessment of student preferences for reinforcement. (b) Behavioral intervention plan. (1)\n\nThe CSE or CPSE shall consider the\ndevelopment of a behavioral intervention plan, as such term is defined in\nsection\n200.1\n(mmm)\nof this\n\nPart, for a student with a disability when: (i) the student exhibits persistent behaviors\nthat impede his or her learning or that of others, despite consistently\nimplemented general school-wide or classroom-wide interventions; (ii)\nthe student's behavior places the\nstudent or others at risk of harm or injury; (iii)\nthe CSE or CPSE is considering more\nrestrictive programs or placements as a result of the student's behavior; and/or\n(iv)\nas required pursuant to\nsection\n201.3\nof this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nIn accordance\nwith the requirements in section\n200.4\nof this Part, in the case of\na student whose behavior impedes his or her learning or that of others, the CSE\nor CPSE shall consider strategies, including positive behavioral interventions\nand supports and other strategies to address that behavior. If a particular\ndevice or service, including an intervention, accommodation or other program\nmodification is needed to address the student's behavior that impedes his or\nher learning or that of others, the IEP shall so indicate. A student's need for\na behavioral intervention plan shall be documented on the IEP and such plan\nshall be reviewed at least annually by the CSE or CPSE. (3)\nA behavioral intervention plan shall not\ninclude the use of corporal punishment, aversive interventions, seclusion, or\nphysical restraints as such terms are defined in section\n19.5\nof this Title. (4)\n\nThe behavioral intervention plan shall\nidentify: (i) the baseline measure of the\nproblem behavior, including the frequency, duration, intensity and/or latency\nof the targeted behaviors. Such baseline shall, to the extent practicable, include data taken across activities, settings, people and times of the day. The baseline data shall be used as a standard to establish performance criteria\nand against which to evaluate intervention effectiveness; (ii)\nthe intervention strategies to be used\nto alter antecedent events to prevent the occurrence of the behavior, teach\nindividual alternative and adaptive behaviors to the student, and provide\nconsequences for the targeted inappropriate behavior(s) and alternative\nacceptable behavior(s); and\n(iii)\na\nschedule to measure the effectiveness of the interventions, including the\nfrequency, duration and intensity of the targeted behaviors at scheduled\nintervals. (5)\n\nProgress\nmonitoring. The implementation of a student's behavioral intervention plan\nshall include regular progress monitoring of the frequency, duration and\nintensity of the behavioral interventions at scheduled intervals, as specified\nin the behavioral intervention plan and on the student's IEP. The results of\nthe progress monitoring shall be documented and reported to the student's\nparents and to the CSE or CPSE and shall be considered in any determination to\nrevise a student's behavioral intervention plan or IEP. (c) Use of timeout.. Except for situations that pose an immediate concern for\nthe physical safety of a student or others as provided for in section\n19.5\n(d)(1)\nof this\n\nTitle, the use of timeout shall be used in conjunction with a behavioral\nintervention plan that is designed to teach and reinforce alternative\nappropriate behaviors. (1)\n\nEach school\nshall ensure that timeout is used consistent with the requirements of section\n19.5\n(d)(1)\nof this\n\nTitle. (2)\nA student's IEP shall\nspecify when a behavioral intervention plan includes the use of timeout, including the maximum amount of time a student will need to be in timeout as a\nbehavioral consequence as determined on an individual basis in consideration of\nthe student's age and individual needs. (3)\n\nThe school district shall inform the\nstudent's parents prior to the initiation of a behavioral intervention plan\nthat will incorporate the use of timeout and shall give the parent the\nopportunity to see the room or physical space that will be used and provide the\nparent with a copy of the school's policy on the use of timeout. (d) Use of physical restraint. Physical restraint, as such term is defined in section\n19.5\n(b)(7)\nof this\n\nTitle shall be used only in situations in which immediate intervention\ninvolving the use of reasonable physical force is necessary to prevent imminent\ndanger of serious physical harm to the student or others. Each school shall\nensure that physical restraint is used consistent with the requirements of\nsection\n19.5\n(d)(2)\nof this\n\nTitle. (1)\n\nPhysical restraint shall not be\nused as a punishment or as a substitute for systematic behavioral interventions\nthat are designed to change, replace, modify or eliminate a targeted\nbehavior. (2)\n\nPhysical restraint\nshall not be used as a planned intervention on a student's individualized\neducation program or behavioral intervention plan. (3)\n\nStaff training. Staff who may be called\nupon to implement physical restraint shall be provided with appropriate\nevidence- based training in safe and effective physical restraint procedures in\naccordance with sections\n19.5\n(d)(8)\nof this\n\nTitle and 200.15(h)(1) of this Part, as applicable.
