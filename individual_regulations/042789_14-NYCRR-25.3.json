Tit. 14 § 25.3 - Prevocational training and evaluation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prevocational training is the process of\ndeveloping the patient's functional competence to be able to participate\neffectively in vocational training or work. This process includes the\ndevelopment of appropriate attitudes toward work, social and personal habits\nnecessary to job performance and interactions with coworkers, and physical\nskills and performance necessary to the performance of job tasks. Prevocational\nevaluation is the process of identifying and assessing an individual's assets, interests and limitations and developing from them appropriate vocational goals\nand objectives and means for their attainment. (b) Prevocational training and evaluation may\ninclude performance of work tasks without compensation which would otherwise\nrequire compensation provided that: (1)\npatient participation in such activities is voluntary; (2)\nthe work tasks are part of an overall\nplan designed and implemented to increase work readiness and training\npotential; and\n(3)\nwork tasks are\ndirected and supervised in accordance with the patient's overall service\nplan. (c) While\ncompensation for work tasks performed as part of prevocational training and\nevaluation is not required, it is encouraged especially for its incentive\neffect. (d) At the conclusion of\nthree months of performance of prevocational work tasks, these tasks shall be\nconsidered to be work requiring compensation in accordance with section\n25.5\nof this Part, unless: (1)\nthere is a comprehensive review of the\nprevocational training or evaluation plan and the patient's progress in\nperformance of assigned tasks by a multi-disciplinary group which, on the basis\nof the review, finds and certifies that: (i) the prevocational plan is adequate to indicate the probability that it will\nresult in the patient being able to undertake vocational training in the\nfuture; and\n(ii)\nthe patient's work\nperformance is such that the production of the patient is\ninsignificant; (2)\nsuch\nreview is repeated each 60 days if performance of work tasks without\ncompensation is continued; (3)\na\nwritten report of each such review is made part of the patient's record; and\n(4)\nthe patient is informed of\nthe results of the review and of his or her right to object and appeal as\nprovided in section\n27.8\nof this Part. (e) Performance of work tasks in\nprevocational training shall be in accordance with the applicable Federal and\n\nState laws and regulations and the terms and conditions of any certificates\nissued thereunder.
