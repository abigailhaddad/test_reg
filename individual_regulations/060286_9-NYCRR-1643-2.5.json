  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1643-2.5 - Temporary financing-funds borrowed from private investors; refinancing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Refinancing out\nof proceeds of issue of new temporary loan notes. Where authorized or directed\nby the division, temporary loan notes issued to private investors may be\nrefinanced, upon maturity, by a new issue of temporary loan notes. The new\ntemporary loan notes must be authorized by separate and appropriate resolutions\nof the local agency. These resolutions authorize the execution of new\nrequisition agreement, the execution and deposit, in escrow, of a new advance\nloan note, the cancellation, upon payment of the maturing issue of the\ntemporary loan notes out of the proceeds of the issue of the new temporary loan\nnotes, of the old requisition agreement and old advance loan note, and the\nexecution and issue of the new temporary loan notes. The resolutions\nauthorizing the contracting of indebtedness (§\n1643-2.2, subd. [b]) and the\nexecution and issue of certificate of indebtedness and of advance loan notes in\nthe aggregate maximum principal amount of the loan contract cover refinancing\nas well as the initial financing and so are not required to be passed each time\nrefinancing is undertaken. (b) Flow\nof funds. Depending on the progress made and anticipated in the development of\nthe project, the new temporary loan notes issued to refinance a maturing issue\nof temporary loan notes may be for a larger principal amount than the old\nnotes, or for the same amount, or for a lesser amount. Generally speaking, only\nthe difference, if any, between the principal amounts of the old and new\ntemporary loan notes will be received or disbursed by the local agency and so\npass through the project's development fund. The proceeds of the new issue of\ntemporary loan notes will first be applied by the bank designated as paying\nagent for the old temporary loan notes directly to the payment of the principal\nof and interest on the old notes and this portion of such proceeds will not, ordinarily, pass through the project's development fund. (c) New temporary loan notes issued for\nlarger amount. Assume that an initial issue of $500,000 of temporary loan\nnotes, secured by an advance loan note for $505,000 is to be refinanced by a\ntemporary loan note issue of $600,000, secured by an advance loan note of\n$606,000 and that the aggregate maximum principal amount of the loan contract\nis $2,200,000. Before the refinancing, the general ledger balances of the\naffected accounts would be as follows: Account 2120, Temporary Loan Notes Payable $500,000\n\nCr. Entry (4): Through the Cash Receipts Register, upon\nreceipt of the check for the difference between the principal amounts of the\nnew and old Temporary Loan Notes: Debit: Account 1111, Development Fund $100,000\n\nCredit: Account 2120, Temporary Loan Notes Payable\n$100,000\n\nNote:No accounting entry is made to reflect passage of\nthe resolution authorizing the execution of the new requisition agreement and\nthe advance loan note in the sum of $606,000 and the cancellation of the old\nrequisition agreement and advance loan note. The new advance loan note is shown\nas a footnote to the balance sheet as described in subdivision (b) of section\n1643- 2.4. (d) New\ntemporary loan notes issued for same amount. Where the new temporary loan notes\nare to be issued in the same amount as the maturing notes, no funds will\nordinarily flow through the project's development fund. Note:No accounting entry is made to reflect the passage\nof the resolution authorizing the execution and issue of the new temporary loan\nnotes or the execution and deposit, in escrow, of the new requisition agreement\nand advance loan note, the latter being the subject of a balance sheet\nfootnote, as previously described. (e) New temporary loan notes issued for\nlesser amount. Where the new temporary loan notes are to be issued in a lesser\namount than the maturing notes, the difference between the principal amounts of\nthe new and old notes will, ordinarily, be disbursed by the local agency out of\ndevelopment funds on hand. The accounting entries are as follows: Entry (5): Through the Cash Disbursements Voucher\n\nRegister: Debit: Account 2120, Temporary Loan Notes Payable\n$100,000\n\nCredit: Account 1111, Development Fund $100,000\n(f) Payment of interest on\nmaturing temporary loan notes. Interest on temporary loan notes outstanding is\naccrued quarterly as described in Part 1644, Debt Service. (1)\n\nWhere the new issue of temporary loan\nnotes is for a larger amount than the maturing issue, the paying agent will, ordinarily, apply the proceeds of the new issue to the interest on the maturing\nnotes, as well as to payment of the principal. In such event, the balance of\nthe proceeds of the new issue passing through the project's development fund\nwill be less (by the amount of the interest) than the difference between the\nprincipal amounts of the new and old notes. Entry (4) above, made through the\ncash receipts register upon receipt of the check for the proceeds, will then be\nmodified to read as follows: Entry (6): Debit: Account 1111, Development Fund $95,000\n\nDebit: Account 2132.2, Accrued Interest\n\nPayable--Temporary\n\nLoan Notes 5,000\n\nCredit: Account 2120, Temporary Loan Notes Payable\n100,000\n(2)\n\nWhere the new\ntemporary loan note issue is for the same, or a lesser, amount than the\nmaturing notes, the local agency will, ordinarily, disburse the interest\nthereon out of funds on hand. The entry will be made through the cash\ndisbursements-voucher register as follows: Entry (7): Debit: Account 2132.2, Accrued Interest\n\nPayable--Temporary\n\nLoan Notes $5,000\n\nCredit: Account 1111, Development Fund $5,000\n(g) Refinancing out of\nproceeds of issue of short-term notes by the State. (1)\n\nThe entries to be made where maturing\ntemporary loan notes are refinanced out of the proceeds of short- term\nborrowing by the State will depend on whether the proceeds of such borrowing\npasses through the project's development fund. Ordinarily, the Comptroller will\nsend the proceeds of its short-term borrowing to the division for transmittal\nto the local agency, for deposit in the project's development fund. The local\nagency will then draw its own checks in payment of the principal of and\ninterest on the maturing notes. If the transaction is handled in this manner, the entries are as follows: Entry (8): Through the Cash Receipts Register, upon\nreceipt of the\n\nState's check: Debit: Account 1111, Development Fund $505,000\n\nCredit: Account 2312, Certificates of Indebtedness\n\nUnissued $505,000\n\nEntry (9): Through the Cash Disbursements-Voucher\n\nRegister: Debit: Account 2120, Temporary Loan Notes Payable\n$500,000\n\nDebit: Account 2132.2 Accrued Interest Payable--\nTemporary Loan Notes 5,000\n\nCredit: Account 1111, Development Fund $505,000\n\nNote:Upon payment of the temporary loan notes, the\nescrow agent will return the requisition agreement and the advance loan note to\nthe local agency, marked \"cancelled\". The local agency should hold the latter\nin its files. (2)\n\nUnder\ncertain circumstances, particularly where time is of the essence, a\nrepresentative of the division will deliver the State's check, in the amount of\nthe advance loan note, directly to the paying agent for the maturing issue of\ntemporary loan notes. In this event, the proceeds of the State's short-term\nborrowing will not pass through the project's development fund and the entries\nwill be made, by journal voucher, as follows: Entry (10): Debit: Account 2120, Temporary Loan Notes Payable\n$500,000\n\nDebit: Account 2132.2, Accrued Interest\n\nPayable--\nTemporary Loan Notes 5,000\n\nCredit: Account 2312, Certificates of Indebtedness\n\nUnissued $505,000\n\nExplanation:To record the payment and cancellation of\ntemporary loan notes nos., out of the proceeds of short-term borrowing by the\n\nState, and the execution and issue of certificate of indebtedness no. ____________. (3)\n\nIf the\nclosing occurs in this manner, the advance loan note will be delivered to the\ndivision, which will hold it against the receipt of the local agency's\ncertificate of indebtedness, the advance loan note being thereupon cancelled\nand returned to the local agency for its files.
