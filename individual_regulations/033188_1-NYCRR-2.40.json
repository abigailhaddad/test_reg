  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.40 - Cleaning and sanitizing of containers and equipment-item 12p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nAll food-contact surfaces, including\nutensils and food-contact surfaces of equipment, shall be cleaned as frequently\nas necessary to protect against allergen cross-contact and against\ncontamination of food. All multiuse containers and utensils shall be thoroughly\ncleaned after each use, and all equipment shall be thoroughly cleaned at least\nonce each day used; provided, that storage tanks shall be cleaned when emptied\nand shall be emptied at least every 72 hours, except that in the case of milk\nplants at which frozen desserts or storable milk products are manufactured, such tanks shall be emptied at least every 96 hours. Storage tanks which are\nused to store raw milk longer than 24 hours and silo tanks used for the storage\nof raw milk shall be equipped with a seven-day temperature recording device\ncomplying with the specifications of Appendix 3 of this Title. (2)\n\nWhenever a milk tank truck has been\ncleaned and sanitized, as required by the commissioner, it shall bear a tag or\na record shall be made showing the date, time, place and signature of the\nemployee or contract operator doing the work, unless the truck delivers to only\none receiving unit where responsibility for cleaning and sanitizing can be\ndefinitely established without tagging. The tag is to be removed at the first\nstop on the route and kept on file for the commissioner. (3)\n\nAll utensils and equipment shall be\ncleaned and sanitized in a manner that protects against allergen cross-contact\nand against contamination of food, food-contact surfaces, and food-packaging\nmaterials. (4)\n\nFood-contact\nsurfaces used in the manufacturing/processing, packing, or holding low-moisture\nfood shall be in a clean, dry, sanitary condition before use. When the surfaces\nare wet-cleaned, they shall be sanitized and thoroughly dried before subsequent\nuse. (5)\n\nIn wet processing, when\ncleaning is necessary to protect against allergen cross-contact or the\nintroduction of microorganisms into food, all food-contact surfaces shall be\ncleaned and sanitized before use and after any interruption during which the\nfood-contact surfaces may have become contaminated. Where equipment and\nutensils are used in a continuous production operation, the utensils and\nfood-contact surfaces of the equipment must be cleaned and sanitized as\nnecessary. (6)\n\nCleaning compounds\nand sanitizing agents used in cleaning and sanitizing procedures shall be both\nfree from undesirable microorganisms and safe and adequate under the conditions\nof use. Compliance with this requirement shall be verified by any effective\nmeans, including purchase of these substances under a letter of guarantee or\ncertification or examination of these substances for\ncontamination. (b) Pipelines and/or equipment designed for mechanical cleaning meet the following\nrequirements: (1)\n\nAn effective cleaning and\nsanitizing regiment for each separate cleaning circuit shall be\nfollowed. (2)\nA temperature\nrecording device shall be installed in the return-solution line to record the\ntemperature and time during which the line or equipment is exposed to cleaning\nand sanitizing. (3)\n\nTemperature\nrecording charts shall be identified, dated and retained for three\nmonths. (4)\n\nDuring each official\ninspection, the commissioner shall examine and initial temperature recording\ncharts to verify the time of exposure to solutions and their\ntemperatures. (c) Plants\nin which containers are washed manually are equipped with a two-compartment\nwash-and-rinse vat for this purpose. Such plants shall also provide a steam\ncabinet or individual steam-jet plate with hood for sanitizing of cleaned\ncontainers, or, if sanitizing is done with chemicals, a third treatment\nvat. (d) In plants utilizing\nautomatic bottle washers, such washers must provide for bactericidal treatment\nby means of steam, hot water or chemical treatment. In soaker-type bottle\nwashers, in which bactericidal treatment depends upon the causticity of the\nwashing solution, the caustic strength for a given soaking time and temperature\nshall be as specified in the following table listing combinations of\ncausticity, time and temperature of equal bactericidal value, for soaker tank\nof soaker-type bottle washers: COMBINATIONS OF CAUSTICITY, TIME AND TEMPERATURE OF EQUAL\nBACTERICIDAL VALUE, FOR SOAKER TANK OF SOAKER-TYPE BOTTLE WASHERS\n(Based on NSDA specifications for beverage\nbottles)\n\nTemperature, degrees\nF\n170\n160\n150\n140\n130\n120\n110\nC\n77\n71\n66\n60\n54\n49\n43\n\nTime in minutes\n\nConcentration\nof NaOH, percent\n3\n0.57\n0.86\n1.28\n1.91\n2.86\n4.27\n6.39\n5\n0.43\n0.64\n0.96\n1.43\n2.16\n3.22\n4.80\n7\n0.36\n0.53\n0.80\n1.19\n1.78\n2.66\n3.98\n\nWhen caustic is so used, subsequent final rinsing of the\nbottles shall be with water which has been treated with heat or chemicals to\nassure freedom from viable pathogenic or otherwise harmful organisms, to\nprevent recontamination of the treated bottle during the rinsing\noperation. (e) All multiuse\ncontainers, equipment and utensils are sanitized before use, employing one or a\ncombination of the methods prescribed under section\n2.18\nof this Part (Item 11r). Assembled equipment must be sanitized prior to each day's run. (f) The residual bacteria count of multiuse\nand single-service containers used for packaging pasteurized milk and milk\nproducts shall not exceed one per milliliter of capacity, when the rinse test\nis used, or not over 50 colonies per/8 square inches (one per square\ncentimeter) of product-contact surface, when the swab test is used, in three\nout of four samples taken at random on a given day. All multiuse and\nsingle-service containers shall be free of coliform organisms. (g) Plants which utilize multiuse plastic\ncontainers for pasteurized milk and milk products shall comply with the\nfollowing criteria: (1)\n\nThe plastic material\nfrom which the containers are molded shall be of safe material. (2)\n\nThe plastic material shall comply with\nthe material specifications of section\n2.39\nof this Part (Item\n11p). (3)\n\nAll containers shall be\nidentified as to plant of manufacture, date of manufacture, and type and class\nof plastic material used. This information may be by code, provided that the\ncode is revealed to the commissioner. (4)\nA device shall be installed in the\nfilling line capable of detecting in each container before it is filled, volatile organic contaminants in amounts that are of public health\nsignificance. Such device must be constructed so that it may be sealed by the\ncommissioner to prevent the changing of its sensitivity functioning level. Models using an air injection system and with a testing device built into the\ndetection equipment do not have to be sealed. To assure proper functioning of\nthe system, the operator needs to be able to adjust the sensitivity. However, those models utilizing an external testing device must be sealed. Any container\ndetected by the device as being unsatisfactory must be automatically made\nunusable to prevent refilling. In addition, the device must be interconnected\nso that the system will not operate unless the detecting device is in proper\noperating condition. (5)\nA standard\nmust be available for the use of the commissioner for testing the proper\nsensitivity functioning levels of the detection device. (6)\n\nThe commissioner may waive the\nrequirement for the detecting device required for in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision if an alternative method of comparable sensitivity is available and\nhas been demonstrated to be effective in milk plant operation. (7)\n\nThe containers shall comply with the\napplicable construction requirements of section\n2.39\nof this Part(Item 11p). The\nclosure for the container shall be single-service. Screw-type closures shall\nnot be used. (8)\n\nThe container\nshall not impart into the product pesticide residual levels or other chemical\ncontaminants in excess of those considered acceptable under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and regulations issued thereunder.
