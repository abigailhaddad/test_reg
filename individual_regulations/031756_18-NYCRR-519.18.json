(b) Technical rules of evidence followed in a\ncourt of law will not be followed, but evidence must be relevant and\nmaterial. (c) Irrelevant and unduly\nrepetitious testimony and cross-examination will be excluded. (d) The appellant has the burden of: (1)\nshowing that the determination of the\ndepartment was incorrect and that all claims submitted and denied were due and\npayable under the program, or that all costs claimed were allowable; and\n(2)\nproving any mitigating\nfactors affecting the severity of any sanction imposed. Where the determination is based upon an alleged failure\nof the provider to comply with generally accepted business, accounting, professional or medical practices or standards of health care, the department\nmust establish the existence of such practice or standard. (e) Copies of records and\ndocuments in the possession of the department may be admitted into evidence as\nphotocopies, however, the originals of such records and documents must be made\navailable for inspection at the direction of the hearing officer whether in\npossession of the department or the appellant. (f) Computer-generated documents prepared by\nthe department or its fiscal agent to show the nature and amount of payments\nmade under the program will be presumed, in the absence of direct evidence to\nthe contrary, to constitute an accurate itemization of the payments made to a\nprovider. (g) An extrapolation\nbased upon an audit utilizing a statistical sampling method certified as valid\nwill be presumed, in the absence of expert testimony and evidence to the\ncontrary, to be an accurate determination of the total overpayments made or\npenalty to be imposed. The appellant may submit expert testimony challenging\nthe extrapolation by the department or an actual accounting of all claims paid\nin rebuttal to the department's proof. (h) The decision after hearing must be\nsupported by substantial evidence. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
