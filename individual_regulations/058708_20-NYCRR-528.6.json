  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.6 - Newspapers and periodicals\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115[a][5]\n(a) Exemption. The sale of newspapers and periodicals is exempt from sales\nand compensating use tax. (b) Definition of newspaper. (1)\n\nIn order to constitute a newspaper, a\npublication must conform generally to the following requirements: (i) it must be published in printed or\nwritten form at stated short intervals, usually daily or weekly; (ii)\nit must not, either singly or, when\nsuccessive issues are put together, constitute a book; (iii)\nit must be available for circulation to\nthe public; and\n(iv)\nit must\ncontain matters of general interest and reports of current events. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that\na publication may be devoted primarily to matters of specialized interest, such\nas legal, mercantile, financial, theatrical, political, religious or sporting\nmatters, nevertheless, if, in addition to the special interest it serves, the\npublication contains general news, it is entitled to the classification of a\nnewspaper. Example 1: A Braille edition of a newspaper is exempt. Example 2: A publication distributed free of charge is not excluded\nfrom qualifying as a newspaper. Example 3: A daily publication which consists of entries and\nselections at various race tracks with articles on matters of general interest\nand reports of current events is a newspaper. However, publications which are\nmerely tip sheets or form sheets are subject to tax. Example 4: A microfilm copy of a newspaper is not a newspaper and the\nsale of such microfilm is the sale of tangible personal property subject to\ntax. Example 5: An individual engaged in the business of clipping and\nselling newspaper articles is not selling newspapers but is selling an\ninformation service which is subject to tax. See section\n527.3\nof this Chapter. (c) Definition of a periodical. (1)\n\nIn order to constitute a periodical, a\npublication must conform generally to the following requirements: (i) it must be published in printed or\nwritten form at stated intervals, at least as frequently as four times a\nyear; (ii)\nit must not, either\nsingly or, when successive issues are put together, constitute a\nbook; (iii)\nit must be available\nfor circulation to the public; (iv)\nit must have continuity as to title and general nature of content from issue to\nissue; and\n(v) each issue must\ncontain a variety of articles by different authors devoted to literature, the\nsciences or the arts, news, some special industry, profession, sport or other\nfield of endeavor. (2)\nA\npublication which may be known as or considered to be a newsletter may qualify\nas a periodical if it conforms to the above standards. Where a newsletter has\nno signed articles, but has a staff of writers who originally prepare articles, such publication will be considered to have articles by different authors. If a\npublication has been classified by the United States Postal Service as one\nwhich is entitled to second class mailing privileges, that fact will be\nconsidered in determining whether or not the publication is a\nperiodical. (3)\n\nNothing in this\nsection shall be construed to exempt as a periodical the following: (i) advertising material, such as catalogs, flyers, pamphlets and brochures; (ii)\nlistings and compilations which\nconstitute information services; (iii)\npublications which are issued at stated\nintervals but which are books or parts of a book. Example 1: Comic books, published serially under the same title at\nleast once quarterly, are exempt as periodicals. Example 2: A weekly publication which consists of television\nprogramming schedules and contains several articles on matters of general\ninterest by various authors is a periodical. Example 3: Single-issue publications that bear no relationship to\nprior or subsequent issues with respect to continuity of literary character, subject matter, style, and format are subject to tax as books. Example 4: A publication is sold by subscription only, to individuals\ninvolved in a particular industry, with the publisher reserving the right to\nrefuse to accept a subscription. This publication is not a periodical as it is\nnot available for circulation to the general public. Example 5: A weekly publication which contains articles about the\nbusiness and its employees is distributed solely to employees of a particular\ncompany. This publication is not a periodical. Example 6: A publisher compiles information concerning corporate\nsecurities and publishes the results in a series of publications issued\nbiweekly. The publications are intended to comprise a complete reference book\nor manual at the end of the year. The publications are not periodicals but\nconstitute a taxable information service. Example 7: A company publishes and distributes weekly and daily\nreports on corporations, corporate securities, and bonds. The publications are\nnot periodicals and constitute a taxable information service. Example 8: A weekly newsletter is comprised of four pages of various\narticles devoted to the automobile industry. Although the articles are not\nsigned, they are prepared by an editorial staff. The publication is sold by\nsubscription and single copies are also available. The newsletter contains no\nadvertising. This newsletter constitutes a periodical. Example 9: A store issues catalogs monthly describing merchandise\noffered for sale. Such catalogs are not periodicals. Example 10: A company publishes and distributes a crossword puzzle\nmagazine monthly. This magazine qualifies as a periodical. Example 11: Advance sheets of court reports are not periodicals. Example 12: Tape recordings of materials extracted from medical\njournals are distributed twice each month to subscribers. The recordings are\nnot periodicals and their sale is the sale of tangible personal property\nsubject to tax. (4)\nA publication which was originally a\nperiodical but which is sold at a price which does not reflect its normal\nretail selling price shall be deemed to be sold as tangible personal property\nfor collection or investment purposes and not as a periodical. Example 13: A periodical, which is not a current issue, is ordered from\nthe publisher. The publisher charges the customer a $1 service charge in\naddition to the selling price of the periodical. The total selling price is\nexempt. Example 14: An individual purchases a rare periodical, which originally\nsold at $1 an issue, at a price of $25. The price of $25 is subject to\ntax. (d) Shopping papers or pennysavers. [Tax Law, § 1115(i)]\n(1)\n\nThe term\nshopping paper\nshall mean those community publications variously known as consumer papers, pennysavers, shopping guides, town criers, dollar stretchers and other similar\npublications, distributed to the public, without consideration, for purposes of\nadvertising and public information. (2)\n\nTo qualify as a shopping paper for\npurposes of this subdivision, the publication must also: (i) be distributed to the public on a\ncommunity-wide basis; (ii)\nbe\npublished at stated intervals at least 50 times a year; (iii)\nhave continuity as to title and general\nnature of content from issue to issue; (iv)\ncontain in each issue news of general or\ncommunity interest and community notices or editorial comment or articles by\ndifferent authors; (v) not\nconstitute a book, either singly or when successive issues are put\ntogether; (vi)\ncontain in each\nissue advertisements from numerous unrelated advertisers; (vii)\nbe independently owned, in that the\npublication is not owned by or under the control of the owners or lessees of a\nshopping center or a merchants association or similar entity or a business\nwhich sells property or services (other than advertising), and the\nadvertisements in such publication are not predominantly for the property or\nservices sold by such business; and\n(viii)\nhave not in excess of 90 percent of\nthe printed area of each issue for advertisements. (3)\n\nReceipts from the retail sale of a\nshopping paper to the publisher of such publication are exempt from the tax\nimposed by subdivision (a) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, and receipts from the\nsale of printing services performed in publishing such paper are exempt from\nthe tax imposed by paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of such section. (e) Advertising\nsupplements. (1)\n\nAn advertising\nsupplement is a publication consisting of advertising, printed in the form of\nnewspaper sheets or other form which is distributed with a newspaper, mailed\nout directly, or used by retail stores as handouts. Advertising supplements, when distributed as inserts in a newspaper, periodical or shopping paper, are\nconsidered part of such newspaper, periodical or shopping paper. (2)\n\nAdvertising in the form of a section, purchased from a newspaper publisher, pursuant to the advertising rate schedule\nfor insertion in its newspaper and numbered as part of the newspaper is part of\nthe newspaper and not an advertising supplement. (3)\n\nThe charge by a printer to an advertiser\nfor whom an advertising supplement is produced is taxable, as a sale of\ntangible personal property, except to the extent that the charge is for\nsupplements which are distributed with newspapers, periodicals or shopping\npapers. (4)\n\nThe purchase of\nmaterials by a printer which become a component part of the advertising\nsupplement such as paper and ink is not taxable because it is for\nresale. (5)\n\nThe charge by a\nnewspaper to an advertiser for distribution of the advertising supplement with\nthe newspaper is a nontaxable advertising service. Example 1: A retailer orders a four-page sheet of advertising from a\nprinter, and has all the copies delivered to a newspaper for distribution with\nthe newspaper. The purchase is exempt from the tax. Example 2: A retailer orders a four-page sheet of advertising from a\nnewspaper publisher for distribution with a newspaper, and for distribution\nwith a newspaper published by another newspaper company. The purchase of the\nadvertising supplement is exempt from tax. Example 3: A retailer orders 100,000 four-page sheets of advertising\nfrom a printer, 75,000 of which are delivered to the retailer's stores. Those\nadvertising sheets which are delivered to the stores are subject to tax and the\nprinter must collect tax based on the proportionate value to the total\ncharge. (f) Purchases by publishers of newspapers, periodicals and shopping\npapers. (1)\n\nPurchases of paper and ink\nused in the publication of newspapers and periodicals are exempt under section\n1118 (5)\nof the Tax Law. See section\n531.5\nof this Title. (2)\n\nPurchases of\ntangible personal property which become a physical component part of newspapers\nor periodicals are purchased for resale and, therefore, not subject to\ntax. (3)\n\nPurchases of paper, ink\nand any other tangible personal property for use in the publication of a\nshopping paper, which become a physical component part of such shopping paper, are exempt under section\n1115 (a)(20)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. A shopping paper is defined in section\n1115 (i)\nof the Tax Law. See subdivision (d) of this section. Cross-reference: See Part 543 of this Title, printing\nindustry. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
