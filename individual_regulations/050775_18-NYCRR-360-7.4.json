  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-7.4 - Liability of third parties\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nWhen care and services are or may be provided to an applicant/recipient for\ntreatment of injury, disease or disability, the State or social services\ndistrict will take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of\nthird parties (including health insurers) to pay for such care and\nservices. (2)\n\nThe social services\ndistrict, when determining or redetermining eligibility, must collect\nsufficient information to enable the State to pursue claims against such third\nparties, including all information specifically required by the\ndepartment. (3)\n\nAs a condition of\neligibility, an applicant/recipient must cooperate with the State or social\nservices district in identifying third parties who may be liable to pay for\ncare. The applicant/recipient must provide information to assist the State in\npursuing such third parties. An applicant/recipient may refuse to cooperate\nonly for good cause. (4)\n\nAs a\ncondition of eligibility, an applicant/recipient with the legal capacity to\nexecute an assignment, must assign to the State and social services district\nany rights against any third party for support (specified as support for\nmedical care by a court or administrative order) and for payment of medical\ncare. The requirement extends to any person with the legal authority to execute\nan assignment on behalf of an applicant/recipient. (5)\n\nThe State or social services district\nwill seek reimbursement for MA when there is a third party legal liability and\nthe expected amount of reimbursement is more than the costs of making the\nrecovery. (6)\n\nUpon furnishing MA to\na recipient, the social services district or the department will be subrogated, to the extent of the expenditures by such district or the department, to any\nrights the recipient may have to medical support or third party reimbursement. For purposes of this section, the term medical support means the right to\nsupport for purposes of medical care as specified by court or administrative\norder. The social services district or the department will issue a written\nnotice of the exercise of subrogation rights to the appropriate party or\nparties. (b) A recipient\nis eligible to receive MA even if he/she has a right of action, suit, claim, counterclaim or demand against a third party for personal injuries suffered, if\nall other eligibility requirements are met. If the social services district\nfinds that the third party has paid or will pay within a reasonable time, the\ndistrict will pay only the amount by which the allowable MA claim exceeds the\nthird party liability. If payment will not be made within a reasonable time, the social services district must file a lien covering the cost of such\nassistance in accordance with section\n104-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law. The recipient will be required to assign to the\ndistrict the proceeds of such right or demand. (c) Whenever a social services district\nauthorizes hospital care for the treatment of recipient's personal injuries, it\nmust obtain a satisfaction or discharge of any hospital lien covering such care\nbefore or at the time payment to the hospital is made. The district must file\nthe satisfaction or discharge in accordance with the Lien Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
