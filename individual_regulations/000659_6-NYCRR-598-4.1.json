  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 598-4.1 - Containers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. This Subpart applies to\ncontainers used to store 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lbs.) or more of a hazardous\nsubstance at a facility for a period of 90 consecutive days or more. (b) Container storage areas. (1)\n\nExcept as described in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, containers must meet the following requirements: (i) incompatible substances stored in\ncontainers must not be stored in close proximity to each other. At minimum, they must be separated by 30 feet; a fire wall with a fire resistant rating of\nnot less than two hours; separate independent dikes; or other equivalent system\nwhich prevents inadvertent mixing and reduces the likelihood of an accident, release, or spill; (ii)\nan\nenclosure such as a warehouse or storm shelter must be provided for those\ncontainers which contain materials which could react with water to generate\nheat, cause pressure build-up in the container, or cause a fire, explosion or\nother adverse reaction. The enclosure must protect the containers from exposure\nto water, be designed to withstand storms, and be anchored into the\nground; (iii)\ncontainers must be\nlocated in an area which has an impervious floor and a perimeter curb or ramp\nof sufficient height to contain 110 percent of the contents of the largest\ncontainer or the total volume which can be spilled from interconnected\ncontainers within the containment area, whichever is greater. The floor must be\ndesigned and constructed with a permeability rate to the substance stored of 1\nx 10-6 cm/sec or less; (iv)\ncontainers must be designed and manufactured in accordance with a consensus\ncode, standard or practice developed by a nationally recognized association or\nindependent testing laboratory and be suitable for the substance stored and the\nconditions of storage. This provision does not apply to containers which are\nmarked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation of\nhazardous substances and which meet applicable Federal requirements; (v) containers must be stored in a stable\nposition and in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If containers\nare stacked, they must be stacked on a stable platform; and\n(vi)\nhazardous substances which are water\nsoluble solids at ambient temperature must be stored in containers which\nprevent entry of water or stored in an area that is protected against the entry\nof water, such as a building or similar enclosure. The container, including the\nfloor, must be designed and constructed with a permeability rate to the\nsubstance stored of 1 x 10-6 cm/sec or less. (2)\n\nContainers which are being transported or\nwhich are located at a staging area for a period of less than five days, and\nrailcars and truck trailers at the site for 180 days or less are exempt from\nthe storage requirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (c) Transfer station secondary\ncontainment. Transfer of hazardous substances must take place within a transfer\nstation equipped with a permanently installed secondary containment system. This containment system must: (1)\nbe capable\nof containing leaks and spills likely to occur during the transfer, including\nleaks or spills from connections, couplings, vents, pumps, valves, hose\nfailure, or overturning of a container. Open-ended fill pipes must be located\nwithin the secondary containment system; (2)\nbe designed and constructed with a\npermeability rate to the substance(s) transferred of less than 1 x 10-6 cm/sec. Properly designed concrete which has water stops on all seams and is compatible\nwith the substance(s) stored or other equivalent or superior material satisfies\nthis requirement; (3)\nbe designed, installed, and operated to prevent any migration of hazardous substances out of\nthe system before cleanup. The system is not required to be designed to contain\nthe gaseous component of a spill; (4)\nbe constructed, coated, or lined with\nmaterials that are compatible with the substances to be transferred and the\nenvironment. The system must have sufficient strength and thickness to\nwithstand wear, hydrostatic forces, frost heaving and weathering. The system\nmust support any vehicle brought into the transfer station, and must have a\nfoundation which prevents failure due to settlement, compression, or\nuplift; (5)\nbe equipped with a sump\nand a manually controlled pump or siphon, manually controlled dike valve, or\nany other manually controlled drainage system to permit the drainage of liquids\nresulting from leaks, spills, and precipitation. Control of the pump, siphon or\nvalve must be possible from outside of the diked area. All drainage systems\nmust be locked in a closed position when a transfer of a hazardous substance is\nin progress. Spilled or leaked substances must be removed from the containment\nsystem within 24 hours; and\n(6)\ncontain the volume of any leak or spill likely to occur at the transfer\nstation. If the stored substance is a liquid at storage conditions and a gas at\nambient conditions, then secondary containment must be provided to contain the\nliquid component of any spill until the phase change from liquid to gas occurs\nor the spill is cleaned-up, whichever comes first. (7)\n\nStormwater must be pumped from slop tanks\nand catch tanks to allow for the containment of the volume required by\nparagraph (6) of this subdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n598-4.1\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register July 19, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 29, eff. 10/17/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
