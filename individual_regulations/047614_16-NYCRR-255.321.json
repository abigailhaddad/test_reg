  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.321 - Installation of plastic pipe\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Plastic pipe must be installed below ground level unless otherwise permitted by\nsubdivisions (l) and (m) of this section. (b) Plastic pipe that is installed in a vault\nor any other below grade enclosure must be completely encased in gas-tight\nmetal pipe and fittings that are adequately protected from corrosion. (c) Plastic pipe must be installed so as to\nminimize shear or tensile stresses. (d) Thermoplastic pipe that is not encased\nmust have a minimum wall thickness of 0.090 inch (2.29 millimeters), except\nthat pipe with an outside diameter of 0.875 inch (22.3 millimeters) or less may\nhave a minimum wall thickness of 0.062 inch (1.58 millimeters). (e) Plastic pipe that is not encased must\nhave an electrically conductive wire or other approved means of locating the\npipe. Tracer wire may not be wrapped around the pipe and contact with the pipe\nmust be minimized but is not prohibited. Tracer wire or other metallic elements\ninstalled for pipe locating purposes must be resistant to corrosion damage, either by use of coated copper wire or by other means. (f) Plastic pipe that is being encased must\nbe inserted into the casing pipe in a manner that will protect the plastic. The\nleading end of the plastic must be closed before insertion. The casing must be\nprepared to the extent necessary to remove sharp edges, projections, or\nabrasive material which could damage the plastic. (g) Care shall be exercised to avoid rough\nhandling of plastic pipe and tubing. It shall not be pushed or pulled over\nsharp projections, dropped or have other objects dropped upon it. (h) Caution shall be taken to prevent kinking\nor buckling, and any kinks or buckles which occur shall be removed by cutting\nout as a cylinder. (i) Squeeze-offs\nof plastic may be made to control flows in accordance with manufacturer's\nrecommendations and a proven procedure without replacement of the pipe section. However, each squeeze-off must be adequately marked on the pipe to preclude\nfurther squeeze-off at that location. (j) The piping shall be installed with\nsufficient slack to provide for possible contraction. Cooling may be necessary\nbefore the last connection is made under extremely high temperature\nconditions. (k) That portion of the\nplastic piping exposed due to the removal of a section of the casing or which\nspans disturbed earth shall be of sufficient strength to withstand the external\nloading and shearing forces or it shall be protected with a suitable bridging\npiece. (l) Uncased plastic pipe may\nbe temporarily installed above ground level under the following conditions: (1)\n\nThe operator must be able to demonstrate\nthat the cumulative above ground exposure of the pipe does not exceed the\nmanufacturer's recommended maximum period of exposure or two years, whichever\nis less. (2)\n\nThe pipe is located\nwhere damage by external forces is unlikely or is otherwise protected against\nsuch damage. (3)\n\nThe pipe\nadequately resists exposure to ultraviolet light and high and low\ntemperatures. (m) Plastic pipe may be installed on bridges provided that it is: (1)\ninstalled with protection from mechanical\ndamage, such as installation in a metallic casing; (2)\nprotected from ultraviolet radiation; and\n(3)\nnot allowed to exceed the\npipe temperature limits specified in section\n255.123\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.321\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
