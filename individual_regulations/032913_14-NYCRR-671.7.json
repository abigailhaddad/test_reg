(e) The result in\nclause\n(d) of this subparagraph shall be divided by 12 and\nthen divided by the total certified capacities of these sites less any\ncertified temporary use bed(s) to determine the uniform monthly supportive IRA\nprice that shall be used to reimburse supportive community residence and\nsupportive IRA facilities. This combined price will be referred to as the\nsupportive IRA price. (ii)\n\nCountable service days. (a) The full month supportive IRA price shall\nbe paid for services provided to an individual who meets the enrollment\nrequirement in subparagraph (5)(i) of this subdivision and who receives\nface-to-face residential habilitation services in accordance with the\nindividual's ISP and community residential habilitation plan on four separate\ndays of the 22 days of the enrollment requirement.

(6)\n\nStandards for countable service days. (i) In computing the countable service days, the provider cannot include days that the individual is in a hospital, nursing\nhome, ICF/DD or other certified, licensed or government funded residential\nsetting. (ii)\n\nThe day the\nindividual is admitted or discharged from one of the other residential settings\nlisted in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph may be a countable service day if, on that day, community residence staff deliver residential habilitation\nservices to the individual at the community residence. (iii)\n\nFor supervised community residences\nonly: in determining countable service days the provider may include days when\nan individual is away from the community residence, for purposes such as\nvacations and visits with family or friends, only when staff from the\nindividual's community residence deliver and document services to that\nindividual that are similar in scope, frequency and duration to the residential\nhabilitation services typically delivered to the individual at the community\nresidence. (iv)\n\nThe provisions of\nthis paragraph notwithstanding, days when all individuals of the community\nresidence are relocated due to an emergency or other conditions which\nnecessitate relocation for the health and safety of those individuals may be\nconsidered as countable if: (a) the\nrelocation is reported to and approved by OPWDD; and\n(b) staff regularly assigned to the community\nresidence continue to deliver and document residential habilitation services\nthat are similar in scope, frequency and duration to those typically delivered\nto the individuals at the certified site. (v) Services provided on countable service\ndays must be documented. On any countable service day there must be\ndocumentation of at least one residential habilitation service delivered to the\nperson by community residence staff on that day. (7)\n\nThe capital component of the community\nresidence price shall be equal to the amount of total allowable annual\nproperty, fixed equipment, and start-up costs pursuant to section\n686.13\n(b)(3)\nand\n\nSubpart 635-6 of this Title divided by 12 and then divided by the total\ncertified capacities of these sites less any certified temporary use bed(s). At\nthe onset of each price period, OPWDD shall review the capital component for\nallowable material changes and if said changes conform to the requirements of\nsection\n686.13\n(b)(3)\nand\n\nSubpart 635-6 of this Title, the capital component shall be revised to reflect\nsaid changes. (8)\n\nTotal\nreimbursable costs derived through the application of the methodologies\ndescribed in this subdivision shall be trended as follows: (i) For providers reporting as Region I\nproviders in operation on June 30th, the appropriate trend factor shall be\napplied to the allowable operating costs, exclusive of property, used to\nestablish the price in effect on June 30th. That trend factor is 2.08 percent\nto trend June 30, 2010 costs to 2010-2011. Retention of the proceeds\nattributable to the application of the trend factor increase shall be\ncontingent upon the provider reporting the use of the funds in the form and\nformat specified by the commissioner. (ii)\n\nFor providers reporting as Region II or\n\nRegion III providers in operation on December 31st, the appropriate trend\nfactor shall be applied to the allowable operating costs, exclusive of\nproperty, used to establish the price in effect on December 31st except that\nfor calendar year 2010, the initial price exclusive of property in effect on\n\nJanuary 1, 2010 shall be trended. From February 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010, facilities shall be reimbursed operating costs that result in a full annual\ntrend factor of 2.08 percent for the calendar year price period. The trend\nfactor in effect for the price period ending December 31, 2010 shall be deemed\nto be the 2.08 percent full annual trend. Retention of the proceeds\nattributable to the application of the trend factor increase shall be\ncontingent upon the provider reporting the use of the funds in the form and\nformat specified by the commissioner. (9)\n\nThe price as computed in accordance with\nthis subdivision shall be offset by rent as determined in accordance with\nsection\n686.13\n(c) of this\n\nTitle. For community residences, the rent allowance shall be the SSI per diem\nlevel as follows: (i) NYC, Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester Counties\n$25.38 per day\n\nRest of State\n$24.39 per day\n(ii)\n\nFor calendar year 1994: NYC and Nassau, Suffolk, and\n\nWestchester Counties\n$25.68 per day\n\nRest of State\n$24.69 per day\n(iii)\n\nFor calendar year 1995: NYC and Nassau, Suffolk, and\n\nWestchester Counties\n$25.97 per day\n\nRest of State\n$24.99 per day\n(iv)\n\nFor calendar year 1996: NYC and Nassau, Suffolk, and\n\nWestchester Counties\n$26.27 per day\n\nRest of State\n$25.28 per day\n(v) For calendar year 1997: NYC and Nassau, Suffolk, and\n\nWestchester Counties\n$26.63 per day\n\nRest of State\n$25.64 per day\n(vi)\n\nFor calendar year 1998: NYC and Nassau, Suffolk, and\n\nWestchester Counties\n$26.89 per day\n\nRest of State\n$25.91 per day\n(vii)\n\nFor calendar year 1999: NYC and Nassau, Suffolk, and\n\nWestchester Counties\n$27.06 per day\n\nRest of State\n$26.07 per day\n(viii)\n\nFor calendar year 2000: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$27.28 per day\n\nRest of State\n$26.30 per day\n(ix)\n\nFor calendar year 2001: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$27.81 per day\n\nRest of State\n$26.82 per day\n(x) For calendar year 2002: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$28.60 per day\n\nRest of State\n$27.60 per day\n(xi)\n\nFor calendar year 2003: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$28.76 per day\n\nRest of State\n$27.76 per day\n(xii)\n\nFor calendar year 2004: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$29.07 per day\n\nRest of State\n$28.07 per day\n(xiii)\n\nFor calendar year 2005: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$29.47 per day\n\nRest of State\n$28.47 per day\n(xiv)\n\nFor calendar year 2006: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$30.10 per day\n\nRest of State\n$29.10\n(xv)\n\nFor calendar year 2007: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$30.63 per day\n\nRest of State\n$29.63\n(xvi)\n\nFor calendar year 2008: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$31.00 per day\n\nRest of State\n$30.00 per day\n(xvii)\n\nFor calendar year 2009: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$31.97 per day\n\nRest of State\n$30.97 per day\n(xviii)\n\nEffective January 1, 2010: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$31.97 per day\n\nRest of State\n$30.97 per day\n(xix)\n\nEffective January 1, 2012: NYC and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$32.60 per day\n\nRest of State\n$31.60 per day\n(xx)\n\nEffective January 1, 2013: NYC, Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$32.90 per day\n\nRest of State\n$31.90 per day\n(xxi)\n\nEffective January 1, 2014: NYC, Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$33.20 per day\n\nRest of State\n$32.20 per day\n(xxii)\n\nEffective January 1, 2015: NYC, Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties\n$1,005 per month\n\nRest of State\n$975 per month\n\nThe commissioner may make adjustments to the offset based on\nthe actual contribution of the persons in residence. The agency must request\nthis adjustment in writing to the commissioner. This request must be made\nwithin one year of the close of the price period in question. (10)\n\nThe price as computed in accordance with\nthis subdivision for a community residence of 16 or fewer beds shall be offset\nas follows: (i) Supervised community\nresidences: (a) Effective January 1, 2010, the offset shall be $1,404 (or a prorated portion thereof for facilities which\nopened after April, 2009) and beginning January 1, 2010, $156 per\nmonth. (b) Effective October 1, 2010, the offset shall be $200 per month. (c) Effective January 1, 2014, the offset\nshall be $189 per month. (d) The\ntotal amount received by a provider for the calendar year 2014 will also\ninclude the amount that the provider would have received if the offset for the\nperiod November 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 had been $189 per month per\nindividual instead of $200 per month per individual. (e) Effective January 1, 2015, the offset\nshall be $194 per month. (f) Effective January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the offset shall be\n$191.50 per month. Effective January 1, 2019, the offset shall be $192 per\nmonth. (ii)\n\nFor\nsupportive community residences the offset shall be $1,134 (or a prorated\nportion thereof for facilities which opened after April, 2009) and beginning\n\nJanuary 1, 2010, $126 per month. Beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 the offset shall be $161 per month. Ef- fective January 1, 2019, the\noffset shall be $154 per month. (11)\n\nEffective October 1, 2010, for providers\nin all regions there shall be an efficiency adjustment applied to the IRA price\nfor residential habilitation services provided in supervised IRAs and\nsupervised community residences. (i) There\nshall be three components of the efficiency adjustment as follows: (a) Non-personal services (NPS). Providers\nwhich demonstrate a level of NPS at or above the benchmark described in\nsubclause (\n2\n) of this clause shall be subject to a reduction\nin the supervised IRA price. (1)\n\nFor the\npurposes of this efficiency adjustment, NPS includes site other than personal\nservices (OTPS), transportation, and expensed equipment contained in the\nsupervised IRA price. NPS does not include personal services, contracted\npersonal services, fringe benefits, total program administration, total agency\nadministration, health care adjustments (HCA), capital costs and State paid\nitems. (2)\n\nThe benchmark is\npredicated on the value of all NPS contained in a community residence\nprovider's supervised IRA price in effect on June 30, 2008 for Region I\nreporting providers and on December 31, 2007 for Region II and Region III\nreporting providers. This value is expressed as a percentage of the total\noperating costs including transportation and HCA but exclusive of capitalized\nproperty contained in a provider's supervised IRA price on the respective date. Alternatively, for community residence providers which did not operate\nsupervised IRAs at these times, the NPS costs and the total operating costs\nshall be extracted from the CFR filed for the period ending either on December\n31, 2007 or June 30, 2008 as appropriate in order to calculate a comparable\nvalue. The percentages for each provider offering residential habilitation\nservices are ranked ordinally. OPWDD has established the benchmark at the 15th\npercentile. All providers below the 15th percentile in the ordinal ranking are\nexempt from the NPS reduction. (3)\n\nFor all providers ranked at or above the benchmark, the reduction shall be\napplied to NPS operating costs contained in the supervised IRA price in effect\non October 1, 2010. (4)\n\nThe\npercentage reduction shall be 18 percent. (b) Administration. Providers which\ndemonstrate a level of administration contained in the supervised IRA price at\nor above the benchmark described in subclause (\n2\n) of this\nclause shall be subject to a reduction in the supervised IRA price. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of this efficiency\nadjustment administration includes total program administration and total\nagency administration contained in a provider's supervised IRA price. Both\ntotal program administration and total agency administration include components\nrepresenting personal services, administrative contracted services, administrative OTPS and administrative fringe benefits. (2)\n\nThe benchmark is predicated on the\ncombined value of total program administration and total agency administration\ncontained in a community residence provider's supervised IRA price in effect on\n\nJune 30, 2008 for Region I reporting providers and on December 31, 2007 for\n\nRegion II and Region III reporting providers. This value is expressed as a\npercentage of the total operating costs including transportation and HCA but\nexclusive of capitalized property contained in a provider's supervised IRA\nprice on the respective date. Alternatively, for community residence providers\nwhich did not operate supervised IRAs at these times, the administrative costs\nand the total operating costs shall be extracted from the CFR filed for the\nperiod ending either on December 31, 2007 or June 30, 2008 as appropriate in\norder to calculate a comparable value. The percentages for each provider\noffering residential habilitation services are ranked ordinally. OPWDD has\nestablished the benchmark at the 15th percentile. All providers below the 15th\npercentile in the ordinal ranking are exempt from the administration\nreduction. (3)\n\nFor all providers\nranked at or above the benchmark, the reduction shall be applied to total\nprogram administration and total agency administration operating costs\ncontained in the supervised IRA price in effect on October 1, 2010. (4)\n\nThe percentage reduction shall be five\npercent. (c) Residual\nadjustment. For providers subject to either one or both of the reductions\ndescribed in clauses(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this\nsubparagraph, a residual adjustment shall be implemented as described in\nsubclauses (\n1\n) and (\n2\n) of this clause. The\nresidual adjustment shall confine the aggregate effect of this efficiency\nadjustment and an offset factor of $44 per unit of service to a range between a\nminimum of 1.5 percent and a maximum of 3.5 percent of the total supervised IRA\nprice on October 1, 2010. (1)\n\nFor providers\nwhich would realize a reduction in the total supervised IRA price less than 1.5\npercent after combining the effects of clauses (\na\n) and\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph and $44 per unit of service, the\ntotal efficiency adjustment shall be increased to 1.5 percent of the total\nsupervised IRA price in effect on October 1, 2010. (2)\n\nFor providers which would realize a\nreduction in the total supervised IRA price greater than 3.5 percent after\ncombining the effects clauses (\na\n) and (\nb\n) of\nthis subparagraph and $44 per unit of service, the total efficiency adjustment\nshall be held to 3.5 percent of the total supervised IRA price in effect on\n\nOctober 1, 2010. (ii)\n\nNew sites. To the extent that a provider\nis subject to this efficiency adjustment, a corresponding correction to\napproved budgeted costs for new sites shall be made so that the percentage\noffsets in effect before inclusion of the new site18 percent NPS, 5 percent\nadministration and any residual adjustment theretoshall be preserved when the\nnew site's budgeted costs are included in the calculation of the supervised IRA\nprice. (iii)\n\nFor purposes of\nrequesting a price adjustment, the effects of this efficiency adjustment\nresulting from the NPS and administrative reductions as described in clauses\n(i)(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this paragraph as well as\nany subsequent residual adjustment thereto per clause (i)(\nc\n)\nof this paragraph shall not be construed as a basis for loss. In processing a\nprice adjustment, any revised price will be offset by the monetary effects of\nthe NPS and administrative reductions including the residual adjustment\nthereto, if any. (iv)\n\nThe\ncommissioner at his or her discretion may waive all or a portion of the NPS\nreduction as described in clause (i)(\na\n) of this paragraph\nand/or the administrative reduction as described in clause\n(i)(\nb\n) of this paragraph for a provider upon the provider\ndemonstrating that the imposition the reduction(s) would jeopardize the\ncontinued operation of the IRA(s) and/or community residence(s). (12)\n\nEffective July 1,2011, supportive IRA prices shall be revised to reflect a two percent reduction to\nthe operating components of the price in effect on June 30, 2011. For the\npurposes of a vacancy price adjustment, the effects of this reduction shall not\nbe construed as a basis for loss. (13)\n\nEffective July 1,2011, pursuant to\nsection\n635-10.5\n(b)(18)(iv)\nof this Title, providers shall be subject to the supervised IRA price\nreductions except for those providers specifically excluded by the exemptions\ndescribed in that subparagraph. (14)\n\nThe price determined through the\napplication of this subdivision may be appealed. Such appeal shall be pursuant\nto section\n686.13\n(i) of this\n\nTitle, except that the determination following such first level appeal process\nshall be the commissioner's final decision. (15)\n\nThe prices determined in accordance with\nthis subdivision shall not be considered final unless approved by the director\nof the Division of the Budget. (c) Employee healthcare enhancement\n(HCE). (1)\n\nProviders are eligible to\nhave additional funding included in their rate if they submitted a completed\n2005 OPWDD survey on health care benefits for all full-and part-time\nemployees. (2)\n\nBased on a survey of\nproviders, OPWDD determined a benchmark of health care benefits offered to\nemployees by providers. In September 2005, OPWDD notified those providers if\ntheir health care benefits were at, above, or below the benchmark. (3)\n\nProviders whose employee health care\nbenefits are below the benchmark may apply to OPWDD for additional funding to\nbe effective January 1, 2006 as follows: (i) For providers which reported on the survey that no health care benefits are\noffered, OPWDD determined an allocation for each provider based on the total\nnumber of employees reported multiplied by $2,500, except that if there are any\nemployees who were reported on the survey and to whom the provider chooses not\nto offer this funding, the allocation based on the total number of employees\nreported will be reduced by the number of excluded employees reported\nmultiplied by $2,500. These funds must be used to establish employee health\ncare benefits or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health-related\nexpenses.

Prior to\n\nOctober 31, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible\nfor health care enhancement (HCE) III funding at the benchmark level. These\nproviders are \"benchmark providers\" and are eligible for HCA VI funding at the\nbenchmark level. All other providers (\"non benchmark providers\") are eligible\nfor HCA VI funding below the benchmark level. (3)\n\nFunding. (i) Providers eligible for HCA VI funding at\nthe benchmark level.

(b) Providers shall use these\nfunds first to offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds shall be\nused to establish or enhance employee health care related benefits and/or to\nreduce employee out-of-pocket health care related expenses. Health care\nadjustment funds included in prices for services delivered on or after July 6, 2011 shall be used by non-benchmark providers for the purposes described in\nthis clause and/or for any other options that continue and/or enhance existing\nhealth care benefits and/or improve the recruitment and/or retention of the\nprovider's lower paid employees. However, in using these funds accordingly, non-benchmark providers may establish which priorities serve the needs of such\nemployees. Additionally, on July 6, 2011, health care adjustment funding shall\nbe included in the reimbursable cost category of fringe benefits in the\nprice. (c) In order to receive the\nHCA VI funds, the provider must have sent to OPWDD a completed application and\nattestation received or postmarked no later than August 13, 2010 unless the\ndeadline was extended by the commissioner.
