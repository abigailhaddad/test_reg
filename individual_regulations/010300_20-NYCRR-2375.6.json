  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2375.6 - Technical memoranda (TSB-Ms)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nTechnical memoranda are informational\nstatements of the Division of Taxation's policies. Where practicable, such\nmemoranda are written in nontechnical language. They are intended: (i) to advise and inform taxpayers, tax\npractitioners, personnel of the division and members of the general public of\nthe division's existing interpretations of provisions of the Tax Law, related\nstatutes and regulations adopted thereunder; and\n(ii)\nto alert such taxpayers and other\npersons to changes in such interpretations, laws or regulations or to\nsignificant Tax Appeals Tribunal or judicial decisions. Technical memoranda generally address distinct statutory or\nregulatory provisions or distinct issues. For example, a technical memorandum\nmight provide detailed guidance for a specific circumstance that, based on\nexperience, requires a more detailed articulation of a general principle set\nforth in the law or regulations. Technical memoranda are primarily designed to\nkeep taxpayers and other interested persons informed and to ensure consistent\nunderstandings throughout the division. (2)\n\nTechnical memoranda are subject to the\nprovisions of subdivision 23 of section\n171\nof the Tax Law. Pursuant to such\nsubdivision, technical memoranda will in no event be issued by the division in\nviolation of the provisions of the State Administrative Procedure Act where\nduly promulgated regulations would be required. (b) Dissemination. Technical memoranda are\ninitiated by the division or the commissioner, published by the division and\nwidely disseminated. These memoranda are provided to all taxpayers and tax\npractitioners who have requested to be included on the technical memoranda\nnotification list. In addition, the division provides technical memoranda upon\nindividual request and to targeted groups who may be interested in such\nmemoranda. Technical memoranda are also distributed, or otherwise made\navailable, to all personnel of the division and are available on the\ndepartment's website. (c) Force and\neffect. Technical memoranda are advisory in nature and fall within the\nexclusions from the rule making procedure imposed by the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act. That is, these statements in themselves have no legal effect but\nare merely explanatory (see also, section\n2375.2\n[b][2]\nof this Part). Accordingly, technical memoranda do not have legal force or\neffect, do not set precedent and are not binding. However, it is well\nestablished that there is a need for administrative agencies such as the\ndivision to publicize information concerning the laws and regulations that they\nadminister and enforce. To the extent that technical memoranda are reasonable\nand consistent with the governing laws and regulations, these vehicles for\ninforming taxpayers and others are and should be employed by such persons to\nassist them in understanding the law and regulations and acting accordingly. Technical memoranda are current as of the date issued. Subsequent judicial\ndecisions, Tax Appeals Tribunal decisions, or changes in the law, regulations, or division policies could affect the validity of the information presented in\na technical memoranda. Technical memoranda are not generally modified, but are\nretained to indicate the division's policies at the time of issuance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2375.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
