Cross-references: For charges of roof gardens and cabarets, see section\n527.12\nof this Part. For exempt transactions when purchased with food stamps, see section\n528.27\nof this Title. (b) Establishments. The following establishments, as well as other\nestablishments engaged in the sale of food or drink for consumption on or off\npremises are required to collect the tax: Automats\n\nCafes\n\nCafeterias\n\nCarry-Out Restaurants\n\nCaterers\n\nDairy Bars\n\nDelicatessens\n\nDiners\n\nDrive-In Restaurants\n\nFast Food Operators\n\nHamburg and Hot Dog Stands\n\nIce Cream Stands\n\nLunch Bars, Counters and Rooms\n\nLuncheonettes\n\nMobile Vending Operators\n\nOyster and Clam Bars\n\nPizzerias\n\nRestaurants\n\nSandwich Bars and Shops\n\nSoda Fountains\n\nTaverns, Grills and Bars\n\nVending Machine Operators\n\nCross-reference: For restaurants eligible to accept food stamps for the\npurchase of meals, see section\n528.27\nof this Title. (c) Premises. The term\npremises\nshall mean the total\nspace and facilities in or on which the vendor conducts his business, including\nbut not limited to parking areas for the convenience of in-car consumption, counter space, indoor or outdoor tables, chairs, benches and similar\nconveniences. (d) Consumption on premises. The phrase\nfor consumption on the premises\nshall mean that the food or drink sold may be consumed on the premises where\nthe vendor conducts his business. (e) Consumption off premises. The phrase\nfor consumption off the\npremises\nshall mean that the food, including sandwiches, or drink is\nintended to be consumed at a place away from the vendor's premises. (1)\n\nFood or drink in a heated or unheated\nstate. The determination of when food or drink is sold either in a heated or\nunheated state must be made according to the vendor's method of merchandising. (i) If the vendor attempts to maintain the\nfood at a temperature which is warmer than the surrounding air temperature by\nusing heating lamps, warming trays, ovens or similar units, or cooks to order, the vendor is selling food in a heated state. (ii)\n\nIf the vendor sells prepared foods from\nunits maintained at or below surrounding air temperature, such sales are sales\nof prepared food in an unheated state. Example 1: A supermarket sells barbecued chicken hot from a rotisserie\nto be taken home and eaten. This is a taxable sale of heated food. Example 2: A food store sells potato salad by the pound and also sells\nhot pastrami by the pound for home consumption. The potato salad is not taxable\nbut the pastrami is subject to tax. (2)\n\nForm, condition, quantity and packaging\nsold in food stores. (i) The term\nfood\nstores\nshall mean any establishment which is principally engaged in\nselling food or drink which is not prepared and ready to be eaten. Supermarkets, grocery stores, fish markets, produce markets, bakeries and meat\nmarkets are examples of the types of establishments considered to be food\nstores. When a department within food stores makes sales of food drink which\nare subject to tax, it must collect the tax. (ii)\n\nFood sold in an unheated state is\ntaxable when sold as sandwiches or meals ready to be eaten when arranged on\nplates or platters as individual or multiple servings regardless of how the\nsales price is arrived at (pound v. serving). (iii)\n\nFood sold in an unheated state is not\nsubject to tax when commonly sold in food stores in bulk by weight by the dozen\n(or part thereof) or by volume (gallon, quart, etc.) for off-premises\nconsumption. (iv)\n\nSales of heated\nand unheated food in combination on plates or as dinners are subject to tax on\nthe total charge. Example 3: Cold cuts, salads and bakery products are sold by a\nrestaurant for home consumption. The restaurant charges its customer by the\npound for the cold cuts and salad and by the dozen or loaf for the bakery\nproducts. Such sales are not taxable. Example 4: A supermarket sells and arranges cold cuts on platters for\ncustomers. The customer is charged by the pound for the cold cuts. Sales of\nthis type are taxable. Example 5: Sandwiches sold through vending machines or other\nestablishments are taxable in all instances. Example 6: A take-out establishment sells 10 pieces of chicken, six\nrolls and one pound of potato salad as a meal for three persons and charges one\nprice for the package. A sale of this type is taxable in full. (f) Caterers. (1)\n\nSales by caterers. (i) All charges by caterers selling food or\ndrink who provide serving or assistance in serving, cooking, heating or other\nservices after delivery are taxable. (ii)\n\nSales of food or drink by caterers where\nthe caterers merely deliver the items purchased and offer no other services\nafter delivery are deemed to be sales for off-premises consumption and are\ntaxable in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nSales of food or\ndrink by caterers where the caterers deliver the items purchased and arrange\nthe food on platters or place the drink in containers so that food or drink is\nready to serve guests are taxable. Example 1: A vendor has contracted to cater a wedding party at a\nprivate hall. The caterer will furnish food and drink, music, kosher\nsupervision, bartenders, waiters and waitresses, and coat checking all of which\nwill be billed by the caterer. All the charges are taxable. Example 2: A vendor sells and delivers cold cuts and salads by the\npound without arranging the food on plates, platters or in portions. The vendor\nprovides no other services after delivery. Sales of this type are not taxable\nbecause the food is not heated and is in the same form and condition, quantities and packaging commonly used by food stores (see subdivision [a] of\nthis section). Example 3: The facts are the same as in Example 2, except the vendor\narranges the foods on a platter so that they are ready to be served to guests. Sales of this type are taxable. (2)\n\nPurchases by caterers. (i) Self-use. Taxable tangible personal\nproperty or services used or consumed by a caterer in performing catering\nservices are not purchased for resale as such and are subject to tax. Examples\nof such taxable property are: tables, tents, chairs, bars, linens, napkins, silverware, glassware, chinaware, serving utensils, table covers, ice used to\nchill food or drinks before serving, as well as floral arrangements not\npurchased in accordance with the conditions set forth in subparagraph (v) of\nthis paragraph. (ii)\n\nFood and\nbeverages for resale. Food, such as meat, vegetables, fruit etc., may be\npurchased exempt from tax by a caterer in accordance with section\n528.2\nof this\n\nTitle. Food, such as candy and confections, which is taxable in accordance with\nsection\n527.1\nof this Part and does not qualify for exemption from tax under section\n528.2\nof this\n\nTitle, may be purchased for resale, and thus not subject to tax, provided it is\nsold to the customer as part of the catering service. Beverages, such as fruit drinks, soft drinks, soda, cocktail mixers, bottled water, beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages which\nare taxable in accordance with section\n527.1\nof this Part and not exempt under section\n528.2\n(b) of this Title may be purchased for resale by caterers provided that such\nbeverages are sold to the customer as part of the catering service. (Ice served\nin drinks may also be purchased for resale.)\n\nExample 4: A vendor has contracted to cater an outdoor party at a\nprivate residence. The caterer is responsible for making all arrangements for\nthe customer such as providing a tent, tables, chairs, linens, silverware, chinaware, napkins, glassware, portable dance floor, bars, floral arrangements\nfor the tables, a band, serving personnel (who are employees of the caterer), food (roast beef, salad, vegetables and dessert - all prepared by the caterer), alcoholic beverages, soft drinks and valet service. The caterer must pay tax on\nany rental or purchase of the tent, tables, chairs, linens, silverware, chinaware, napkins, glassware, portable dance floor and bars, as well as any\nfloral arrangements not purchased in accordance with the conditions set forth\nin subparagraph (v) of this paragraph. The charges by the band and by the valet service are not\ntaxable to the caterer since they are not services subject to tax. The\ncaterer's purchases of the uncooked meat and the salad, vegetable and dessert\ncomponents are exempt from tax in accordance with section\n528.2\nof this\n\nTitle. The caterer's purchases of alcoholic beverages and soft drinks are\npurchases for resale, not subject to tax, in accordance with section\n527.1\n(a) of this Title. The caterer's entire charge to the customer is\ntaxable. (iii)\n\nOther\nproperty sold to customers. (a) Tangible\npersonal property which is necessary to contain an item of food or drink for\ndelivery to the customer and which is transferred to the customer with the sale\nof the food or drink may be purchased for resale by caterers. Such property\nincludes disposable containers, wrappers, cups, dinner plates, trays, platters\nand the accompanying lids. (b) Tangible personal property which is not necessary to contain an item of food or\ndrink for delivery to the customer may not be purchased for resale and is\ntaxable when purchased by caterers, regardless of the fact that the item is\ntransferred to the customer with the sale of food or drink. This includes\nnapkins, stirrers, straws, plastic utensils, and other similar items. Cross-reference: (See subdivision (d) of section\n528.20\nof this Title for more information on wrapping and packaging material that may\nbe purchased for resale.)\n(iv)\n\nTaxable food or drink. Purchases by\ncaterers of prepared food or drink (taxable under subdivision (a) of this\nsection) may not be made for resale and are subject to tax at the time of\npurchase. However, a caterer may take a credit on its sales tax return for the\ntax paid on such food. (See subdivision (i) of this section for more\ninformation on the purchase of food or drink for resale.)\n\nExample 5: A caterer has several parties at one time and is unable to\nprepare all the food for the various groups. The caterer purchases prepared\nmeat platters and prepared hot and cold salads to distribute to the various\ncatered groups. Although the caterer may not purchase the prepared food exempt\nfrom tax as a purchase for resale, it may claim a credit when reporting its\ncatered sales on its sales tax return for the tax paid on the\nfood. (v) Flowers purchased\nfor resale by caterers. Notwithstanding the contrary provisions of this\nparagraph, caterers may purchase flowers from a florist for resale under the\nfollowing conditions: (a) The customer must\nhave the option not to purchase any flowers at all. If the customer wants\nflowers, the customer must have the option of dealing directly with a florist\nof the customer's choosing or of purchasing them through the caterer. If the\ncustomer chooses its own florist or not to have flowers, the caterer's charge\nis reduced to reflect that it is not providing flowers. (b) The customer of the caterer must have\ncomplete control over the selection and arrangement of the flowers. (c) The customer or guests of the customer\nmust have the right to remove the flowers from the caterer's\npremises. (d) The caterer must\nmaintain records identifying specifically the customer, florist and flowers\nthat were purchased for resale. (e) The caterer may not itself use the customer's flowers. Nor may the caterer use\none customer's flowers for another customer. (f) The caterer must collect the sales tax\nfrom the customer on the entire charge, including any charge for flowers. Example 6: Same facts as in example 4, except that the customer was\nallowed to select the type of flowers and the florist from which it wished to\nhave the floral arrangements purchased. In addition, the customer had the\noption to purchase the flowers directly from the florist. The customer allowed\none person from each table to take home the flower arrangement at the\nconclusion of the party. The caterer charged sales tax on the entire bill, including the floral arrangements. While all charges billed to the customer are\nsubject to tax, the caterer may purchase the floral arrangements for resale\nwithout paying tax, since all of the conditions have been met. If the customer purchases flowers directly from a florist\nand has delivery made to the caterer's premises, the customer must pay the tax\ndirectly to the florist. (g) Sales through vending machines. (1)\n\nVending machine operations carried on in\npremises where facilities such as tables, chairs, benches, counters, etc. are\nprovided for customers are considered to be eating establishments selling food\nor drink for on-premises consumption and sales made through such machines are\ntaxable. (2)\n\nWhen food or drink is\nsold through vending machines and no facilities are provided for customers, such sales are deemed to be for off-premises consumption and are taxed\naccordingly. (3)\n\nWith regard to\nsales of 10 cents or less made through vending machines, see subdivision (h) of\nthis section. Example 1: Vending machines located in a hallway dispense hot coffee, sandwiches and pastries. No facilities are provided for customers. Only sales\nof coffee and sandwiches are taxable. Example 2: Vending machines located in a room, containing tables and\nchairs, dispense potato chips and snacks, sandwiches, coffee and pastries. All\nsales from the machines are taxable. (h) Exclusions. The tax imposed on the sale of food or drink shall not\napply to: (1)\n\nFood or drink sold to an\nairline for consumption in flight. Example 1: A restaurant delivers food and drink to an airline. The\nfood and drink are for consumption in flight and are not\ntaxable. (2)\n\nFood or drink\nsold to a student of a nursery school, kindergarten, elementary or secondary\nschool at a restaurant or cafeteria located on the premises of such\nschools. (3)\n\nFood or drink, other\nthan alcoholic beverages, sold to an enrolled postsecondary school student, under the terms of a contractual agreement whereby the student does not pay\ncash when served. In addition, such sales must be made at a restaurant, tavern\nor other establishment on the premises of the school which is a postsecondary\nschool. Such postsecondary school must be operated by an exempt organization or\noperated with the sanction of the State of New York. Example 2: A student who has paid a semester charge for room and board\nor board alone has entered into a contractual arrangement for food and drink. The arrangement provides for a fixed number of meals over the duration of the\ncontract, which are served in designated areas. The student is provided with\nidentification which entitles the student to be served meals. This plan\nqualifies for the exclusion. Example 3: A student purchases scrip from the educational institution, to be used in lieu of cash at the various eating establishments. The scrip is\ntransferable, and no identification is required to use it. This plan does not\nqualify as a contractual obligation. (4)\n\nFood or drink sold through coin-operated\nvending machines at 10 cents or less, provided the vendor is primarily engaged\nin making such sales and maintains records satisfactory to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. The word\nprimarily\nused in this\nparagraph shall mean 50 percent or more of gross receipts from all business\noperations during a reporting period are attributable to sales of 10 cents or\nless through vending machines. (i) Resale. (1)\n\nAny person purchasing food or drink for\nresale as such is required to pay tax thereon at the time of\npurchase. (2)\n\nWhen the food or\ndrink is subsequently resold, the seller is required to collect tax from the\npurchaser. (3)\n\nThe tax paid by the\nseller may be taken as a credit against the tax which the seller is required to\ncollect and remit on the subsequent sale. The credit is limited to the amount\nof tax actually paid on the purchase by the seller of the food and drink\nresold. Cross reference: See Part 534 of this Title. (j) Employee meals. (1)\n\nFood and drink furnished by an employer\nto employees are not subject to tax if the employer receives no cash (or other\nconsideration) for the food and drink from the employees and the value of the\nfood and drink is not income for the employees under the Federal or State\nincome tax laws. (2)\n\nAn employer\nfurnishing food and drink to his employees as provided above is not required to\ncollect or pay a tax on the value assigned to the food and drink. However, the\nemployer is liable for tax on the cost of any taxable components of such food\nand any taxable drink furnished to employees. (3)\n\nAny charge by an employer to an employee\nfor food or drink is subject to tax, whether paid in cash by the employee or\nwithheld from the employee's wages. (4)\n\nThis subdivision shall apply only to\nmeals furnished to employees of restaurants, hotels, motels and similar\nestablishments. (k) Subsidized employee cafeterias and food service operations. (1)\n\nAn employer who by contract or otherwise\nengages a caterer or food service contractor to provide food and drink or\nservice to employees at the employer's expense is the purchaser of food and\ndrink subject to the sales tax. Example 1: Employer E provides food and drink to his employees without\ncharge. E contracts with a food service contractor F to prepare and serve the\nfood and drink for a fee to be paid by E. The fee paid by E is subject to tax\nas a receipt from the sale of food and drink. (2)\n\nSales of food, drink or service to\nemployees through a cafeteria on an employer's premises are subject to the\nsales tax. Example 2: Employer E maintains a cafeteria or restaurant on his\npremises for the purpose of selling food and drink to his employees. The sale\nof the food and drink to the employees is taxable. (3)\n\nWhen the employer subsidizes the caterer\nor food service contractor, such subsidy, regardless of whether it is called a\nmanagement fee, guarantee of profit or some other designation, is taxed as a\nreceipt from the sale of food and drink. Example 3: Caterer C agrees to charge employer E's employees a\nscheduled amount for each item of food and drink it sells to them. E agrees to\npay caterer C an amount, in addition to the employees' payments, which would\nguarantee a 12 1/2 percent profit from the sales to the employees. The amount\npaid by E to the caterer is a taxable receipt from the sale of food and\ndrink. Example 4: Employer E enters into an agreement with caterer C. The\nagreement provides that C prepare, serve and sell food and drink to E's\nemployees at a price mutually agreed to and in addition, E will pay a subsidy\nto C for operating the facility. The subsidy will be such an amount to allow C\nto make a profit on its sales of food and drink to the employees. However, if\nC's profits from the sale of food and drink exceed a set figure, C and E will\nshare the excess profits in an agreed apportionment. Irrespective of the profit\nsharing agreement, the subsidy paid by E is considered to be a receipt from the\nsale of food and drink. (4)\n\nIf a subsidy is paid by an employer in addition to a specified amount paid by\nthe employee, both amounts are taxed as the receipt from the sale of food and\ndrink. Example 5: Employer E will pay 50 cents to a caterer for each sale of\nfood and drink to E's employees. E's employees will pay any amount due which\nexceeds the 50 cents paid by E. Both the amount paid by the employee and the 50\ncents paid by E are taxable receipts from the sale of food and\ndrink. (5)\n\nThe caterer or\nfood service contractor is a vendor required to collect the tax on receipts\nfrom either the employee, employer or both. (l) Gratuities and service\ncharges. Any charge, made to a customer, is taxable as a receipt\nfrom the sale of food or drink, unless: (1)\nthe charge is separately stated on the\nbill or invoice given to the customer; (2)\nthe charge is specifically designated as\na gratuity; and\n(3)\nall such monies\nreceived are paid over in total to employees.
