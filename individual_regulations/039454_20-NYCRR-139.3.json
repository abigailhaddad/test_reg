  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 139.3 - Modifications\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 639(a)(2)\n(a) The applicable modifications, described\nin sections\n112.2\nand\n112.3\nof this Title, pertaining to items from New York State sources which enter into\nthe definition of\n\nFederal distributable net income\nmust, except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, be combined into a\nsingle net figure. This figure, which may be a plus or minus figure, is termed\nnet change. After this figure is computed, it is then\nallocated in the manner described in section\n139.4\nof this Part for allocating distributable net income from New York State\nsources. However, when a New York State item, which would give rise to a\nmodification, has already been included in Federal distributable net income, no\nmodification which would have the effect of duplicating the item is required to\nbe made. (An example would be interest income received by an estate on State of\n\nCalifornia bonds, the basis for a modification under section\n112.2\n(a) of this Title, where the bonds are assets of a New York State business which is\ncontinued by the executor of a nonresident decedent's estate.)\n(b) Modifications not includible in net\nchange. Any modification, or portion thereof, described in\nsubdivision (a) of this section relating to an item of income, gain, loss or\ndeduction derived from New York State sources which enters into the definition\nof\n\nFederal distributable net income\nis not to be included in\ndetermining net change, under subdivision (a) of this section, if the item to\nwhich the modification pertains is paid or permanently set aside during the\ntaxable year for a New York State charitable purpose pursuant to the terms of\nthe governing instrument of the estate or trust. If a charitable organization\nis designated in the governing instrument as a distributee of a percentage or\npart of the estate or trust income, gain, loss or deduction, but not as the\ndistributee of a particular item of income, gain, loss or deduction, the\nportion of such a modification to be excluded from the determination of net\nchange is such proportion of the modification as the amount paid or payable to\nthe charitable organization bears to the total income of the estate or trust. For purposes of this Part, New York State charitable purpose\nmeans contributions to the State of New York or any political subdivision\nthereof, or to any corporation, trust, community chest, fund, foundation or\nother entity organized or operated under the laws of New York State, which are\nallowed as deductions in computing Federal taxable income.
