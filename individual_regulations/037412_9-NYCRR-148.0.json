(CSEA) signed a collective bargaining agreement for\nthe period April 1, 1979 through March 31, 1982, covering employees in the\n\nAdministrative Services, Institutional Services and Operational Services\nnegotiating units which requires that employee performance be evaluated in an\nobjective manner based on standards established by management. In June 1980, the State and CSEA signed a second agreement which revised certain aspects of\nthe performance evaluation system outlined in the original agreement. Monetary\ncompensation in the form of a performance advancement payment or a performance\naward payment shall be available to eligible employees in the three bargaining\nunits, dependent upon the employee performance rating. The purpose of such\nperformance evaluation is to motivate all employees toward more effective\nperformance and greater productivity by the provision of advancements or awards\nto eligible employees. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n148.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
