  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4115.5 - Operation of starting gate\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Such starting gate shall be operated under the control and direction of the\nstarter licensed and designated by the commission. The licensed race track may\nemploy additional persons to assist the starter in the performance of the\nstarter's duties and such personnel shall be licensees of the commission. The\nstarter shall have control of the horses from the formation of the parade until\nthe starter gives the word \"go.\"\n(b) The starting gate, with its arms\nextended, shall be stationed on a one-half mile track as near one-quarter mile\nbefore the starting point as the track will permit. On a mile track it will be\nstationed at the head of the stretch. (c) After two preliminary warm-up scores, unless otherwise directed by the starter, the starter shall notify the drivers\nto come to the starting gate. At no time during the scoring or start shall the\ndrivers engage each other in unnecessary conversation. (d) The horses shall be brought to the\nstarting gate within two minutes after the completion of the last warm-up score\nunless a longer time is prescribed by the presiding judge or the\nstarter. (e) Upon notice from the\nstarter, the drivers will align their horses in the order of their post\npositions behind the gate. (f) The\nstarter will cause the gate to move towards the starting point, gradually\nincreasing the speed of the gate but maintaining a speed which will average: (1)\nfor the one-eighth mile, not less than 11\nmiles per hour; (2)\nfor the next\none-sixteenth mile, not less than 18 miles per hour; (3)\nfrom that point to the starting point a\ngradual increase to maximum speed. (g) During the course of the start there\nshall be no decrease in the speed of the gate except for recall as hereinafter\nprovided. (h) The starting point\nshall be a point marked (but not lighted) on the inside rail a distance of not\nless than 200 feet from the first turn. (i) The starter shall give the word \"go\" at\nthe starting point. (j) At a point\non the track designated by the commission a post shall be erected (\"recall\npost\"). Upon reaching such post during the course of the start, if the starter\ndetermines that a fair start for each horse is possible, no recall shall be had\nthereafter unless: (1)\na horse scores ahead\nof the gate; (2)\nthere is\ninterference; (3)\na horse has\nbroken equipment; (4)\na horse falls\nbefore the word \"go\" is given. (k) There shall be no recall after the word\n\"go\" is given. (l) A recall shall\nbe signaled by the flashing of a light on the starting gate plainly visible to\nthe drivers, and by sounding a claxon or horn or other distinctively audible\nsignal. Upon making such signals the starting gate shall proceed out of the\npath of the horses. (m) In the\nevent of a \"recall,\" all the horses in the race shall return immediately to the\nquarter pole to form for a fresh start. (n) Upon passing the recall post every horse\nshall be deemed a starter unless it has fallen or been excused by the starter\nbefore the word \"go\" is given. (o) No persons shall be allowed to ride in the starting gate except the starter and\nthe starter's driver or operator unless permission has been granted by the\ntrack steward in charge of the race meeting. (p) Each mobile starting gate shall be\nequipped with a mechanical loudspeaker for the sole purpose of communication\nwith the drivers. The volume thereof shall be carefully kept at the minimum\nnecessary for such purpose. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
