  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 674.8 - Evidence\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All evidence\nsubmitted must be relevant. However, other legal rules of evidence observed in\ncourts need not be strictly applied. Hearsay evidence may be admitted if a\nreasonable degree of reliability is shown. (b) Although relevant, evidence may be\nexcluded if its value as proof is substantially outweighed by potential for\nunfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, due delays, waste of time or\nneedless presentation of repetitious or duplicative evidence. (c) Where a part of a document is offered as\nevidence by one party, any party may offer the entire document as\nevidence. (d) Each witness shall be\nsworn or make an affirmation before testifying. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n674.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
