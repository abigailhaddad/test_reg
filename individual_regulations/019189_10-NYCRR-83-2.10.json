(b) If upon review of a periodic report or application for renewal and any information submitted in response to a request, or at any time following the issuance of a certificate of public advantage, it appears to the department, in consultation with the Attorney General and, as appropriate, the mental hygiene agencies, that the parties to the cooperative agreement or planning process have failed to comply with any condition of the certificate or that the benefits or likely benefits resulting from a cooperative agreement or planning process no longer outweigh the disadvantages or likely disadvantages resulting from the agreement, the department shall advise the parties to the agreement and request any documentation or information necessary to complete a review of the matter. (c) The parties must supply any additional documentation or information requested by the department within 30 days, or any other stated time frame, of such request, or must obtain from the department an extension of the time in which to provide such documentation or information which is requested.
