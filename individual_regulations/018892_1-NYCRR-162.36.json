  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.36 - Hydroponic or greenhouse tomato standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality\nhydroponic or greenhouse tomatoes shall be tomatoes of similar varietal\ncharacteristics, mature, but not overripe or soft, clean, fairly well formed; which are free from decay, sunscald, and freezing injury, and free from damage\ncaused by bruises, cuts, shriveling, puffiness, catfaces, growth cracks, scars, disease, insects, or other means. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nSimilar varietal characteristics means\nthat the tomatoes are alike as to character of color (bright red varieties\nshall not be mixed with varieties having a purplish tinge). (2)\n\nMature means that the contents of two or\nmore seed cavities have developed a jellylike consistency and the seeds are\nwell developed. External color shows at least a definite break from green to\ntannish-yellow, pink or red color on not less than 10 percent of the\nsurface. (3)\n\nSoft means that the\ntomato yields readily to slight pressure. (4)\n\nClean means that the individual tomato is\npractically free from dirt and other foreign matter. (5)\n\nFairly well formed means that the tomato\nis not more than slightly kidney-shaped, lopsided, elongated, angular, or\notherwise slightly deformed. (6)\n\nReasonably well formed means that the tomato is not more than moderately\nkidney-shaped, lopsided, elongated, angular, or otherwise moderately\ndeformed. (7)\n\nDamage means any\nspecific defect described in this section; or an equally objectionable\nvariation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of\ndefects, which materially detracts from the appearance, or the edible or\nmarketing quality of the tomato. The following specific defects shall be\nconsidered as damage: (i) Puffiness when the\nopen space in one or more locules materially detracts from the appearance of\nthe tomato when cut through the center at right angles to a line running from\nthe stem to the blossom end. (ii)\n\nCatfaces when scars are rough or deep, when channels are very deep or wide, when channels extend into a locule, or when affecting the appearance to a\ngreater extent than the following: (a) A small\nsize tomato having a fairly smooth catface equivalent in area to a circle 3/8\ninch diameter. (b) A medium size\ntomato having a fairly smooth catface equivalent in area to a circle 1/2 inch\nin diameter. (c) A large size\ntomato having a fairly smooth catface equivalent in area to a circle 3/4 inch\nin diameter. (iii)\n\nGrowth cracks (radiating from or concentric to the stem scar) when not well\nhealed, when more than 1/8 inch in depth, or when affecting the appearance or\nmarketing quality of the tomato to a greater extent than that of a tomato five\nounces in weight having any individual radial crack 1/2 inch in length, or\nhaving more than a one inch aggregate length of all radial cracks measured from\nthe edge of the stem scar. (iv)\n\nScars (other than catfaces) when the appearance of the tomato is affected to a\ngreater extent than that of a tomato five ounces in weight having a scar with\nno depth which has an area equivalent to that of a circle 3/8 inch in\ndiameter. (v) Cuts, not well\nhealed, not shallow, or which affect the appearance or marketing quality of the\ntomato to a greater extent than that of a tomato five ounces in weight having a\ncut 1/2 inch in length. (8)\n\nSerious damage means any specific defect\ndescribed in this section, or an equally objectionable variation of any one of\nthese defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which seriously\ndetracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the tomato. The following specific defects shall be considered as serious damage: (i) Puffiness when the open space in one or\nmore locules seriously detracts from the appearance of the tomato when cut\nthrough the center at right angles to a line running from the stem to the\nblossom end. (ii)\n\nCatfaces when\nchannels extend into the locule, when the wall has been weakened to the extent\nthat slight pressure will cause the tomato to leak, or when the appearance of\nthe tomato is affected to a greater extent than that of a tomato five ounces in\nweight having a fairly smooth catface with an area equivalent to that of a\ncircle one inch in diameter. (iii)\n\nGrowth cracks (radiating from or concentric to the stem scar) when not well\nhealed, when more than 1/8 inch in depth, or when affecting the appearance or\nmarketing quality of the tomato to a greater extent than that of a tomato five\nounces in weight having individual radial cracks 3/4 inch in length, or having\nmore than a 1 1/2 inch aggregate length of all radial cracks, measured from the\nedge of the stem scar. (iv)\n\nScars\n(other than catfaces) when the appearance of the tomato is affected to a\ngreater extent than that of a tomato five ounces in weight having a scar with\nno depth which has an area equivalent to that of a circle one inch in\ndiameter. (v) Cuts, not well\nhealed, not shallow, or which affect the appearance or marketing quality of the\ntomato to a greater extent than that of a tomato five ounces in weight having a\ncut 1/2 inch in length. (c) Size. The size of tomatoes may be\nspecified in accordance with one of the following classifications or jumble\npacked. (1)\n\nSmall. Under 3 1/2\nounces. (2)\n\nMedium. From 3 1/2 to 9\nounces. (3)\n\nLarge. Over 9\nounces. (d) Standard\npack. When packed to a size classification tomatoes shall be fairly uniform in\nsize when packed in containers. (1)\n\nFairly\nuniform in size means that not more than 10 percent, by weight, of the tomatoes\nin any container may vary more than the following within the applicable size\nclassification. (i) Four ounces for medium, small to medium or medium to large. (ii)\n\nSix ounces for large size. (e) Tolerances. In\norder to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling in each\nof the foregoing grades, the following tolerances, by weight, are provided as\nspecified: (1)\n\nFor defects. Ten percent of the\ntomatoes in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the grade, but not\nmore than 1/2 of this amount, or five percent, shall be allowed for serious\ndamage, including in this latter amount not more than 1/2 of one percent for\ntomatoes which are soft or affected by decay. (2)\n\nFor off-size. Fifteen percent of the\ntomatoes in any lot may vary from the specified size, including therein not\nmore than five percent for tomatoes which fail to meet any specified minimum\nsize. (f) Application of\ntolerances. The contents of individual packages in the lot are subject to the\nfollowing limitations: (1)\n\nFor a tolerance of\n10 percent or more, individual packages shall have not more than 1 1/2 times\nthe tolerance specified: provided, that when the package contains 15 specimens\nor less, any individual package shall have not more than double the tolerance\nspecified, except that at least one defective and one off-size specimen may be\npermitted in any package; and provided further, that the averages for the\nentire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade. (2)\n\nFor a tolerance of less than 10 percent, individual packages in any lot shall have not more than double the tolerance\nspecified, except that at least one defective and one off-size specimen may be\npermitted in any package: provided, that the averages for the entire lot are\nwithin the tolerances specified for the grade. (g) Packing. Tomatoes must be packed in\nstandard cartons. All packaging shall be subject to approval by the Department\nof Agriculture and Markets. Package approval shall be based upon the ability of\nthe package to maintain the quality standards and integrity of the\nproduct. (h) Markings. Each package\nor display of tomatoes shall be plainly labeled with the official Seal of\n\nQuality designation. If sized, size markings shall be marked on the container\nand comply with size classifications as stated in these standards. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
