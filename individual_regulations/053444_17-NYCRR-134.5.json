  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 134.5 - Performance bonds and deposits\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department may require a performance bond and/or a\ndeposit on an annual basis, or otherwise, if the failure of the permittee to\ncomplete the work specified by the permit would, in the department's\ndiscretion, necessitate completion of the work by the department to restore the\nright of way to a condition, visual or otherwise, compatible with the condition\npre-existing the issuance of the permit. Any deposit shall be returned when the\nwork is satisfactorily completed. The performance amount or deposit shall be\nset by the department, consistent with the scope and magnitude of the work\ninvolved. Failure to maintain a required performance bond immediately\nterminates a permit issued pursuant to this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n134.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
