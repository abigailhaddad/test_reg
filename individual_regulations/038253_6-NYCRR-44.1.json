V-notched lobster\nalso means any female lobster which is\nmutilated in a manner which could hide, obscure, or obliterate such a\nmark. (b) Identification of gear used in taking of lobsters. Gear used in taking lobsters must be identified as\nfollows: (1)\n\nAll lobster pots or\ntraps, while in operation, must have attached to them a floating buoy or\nidentification marker which must be constructed and placed as to be clearly\nvisible on the surface of the water. Plastic containers, bottles or jugs\noriginally designed to contain liquids must not be used as buoys or markers to\nidentify the location of lobster pots or traps. (2)\n\nEach buoy or marker attached to a lobster\npot or trap must be of a distinctive color. The number, including any letters, assigned the holder of a lobster permit for the current year at the time he or\nshe obtains a lobster permit must be painted or otherwise affixed on each buoy\nor marker in a contrasting color, or branded on each buoy or marker, in clearly\nvisible characters not less than two inches in height.

(3)\n\nThe same number\nappearing on a buoy or marker shall also be marked or branded, in characters\nnot less than three-fourths inch in height, on all pots or traps identified by\nthat buoy or marker. If the construction of a pot or trap does not allow it to\nbe marked by branding, that pot or trap shall be marked by a tag or other\ndevice bearing, in clearly visible and legible characters, the same number\nappearing on a buoy or marker used to identify that pot or trap. This tag or\nother device shall be of a material that is not deteriorated by sea water and\nshall be firmly attached to the pot or trap it identifies. A valid trap tag is\nan acceptable identifying marker as long as it contains the fisherman's New\n\nYork State commercial lobster harvester's permit number. (4)\n\nLobster pots shall not be placed within\n25 feet of designated navigation channels, and all floating buoys or\nidentification markers and lines attached to such pots shall remain outside\ndesignated navigation channels at all times. (5)\n\nViolations of any provision of this\nsubdivision shall subject the violator to the penalties fixed by the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law and may result in the suspension or revocation\nof any lobster permit. (c) Construction of escape vents and\npanels in lobster pots or traps. (1)\n\nEffective June 1, 2010, all lobster pots or traps in use shall contain in the\nparlor section (that part of a pot or trap farthest from the entrance or\nentrances which holds the lobsters until they are removed by the permit holder)\neither one or more unobstructed rectangular openings not less than five and\nthree quarter inches by not less than two inches or two or more unobstructed\ncircular openings not less than two and five-eights inches in diameter each. These openings, called escape vents, shall be placed so that they are on a\nside, but not at the bottom or top, of the parlor section of the pot or\ntrap. (2)\n\nIn addition to the\nrequirements set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, lobster pots or\ntraps made of any material other than untreated natural wood shall contain on a\nside, but not the bottom, of the parlor section an escape panel, which when\nopen, will provide an unobstructed opening of not less than three and\nthree-fourths inches by three and three-fourths inches in length and height. The panel may incorporate escape vents having the dimensions described in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. If this panel is constructed of wood, it\nshall be untreated natural wood not more than three-eighths of an inch thick. If the panel is constructed of any material other than untreated natural wood, it shall be hinged to open. Effective July 19, 2006, the panel shall be hinged\nin such a manner that upon degradation of the material keeping the panel\nclosed, the panel is released to produce an opening which is not blocked or\notherwise obstructed by the panel material. Hinged panels shall be held in the\nclosed position with either untreated, uncoated ferrous wire not more than\nthree thirty-seconds of an inch in diameter or an untreated natural fiber such\nas cotton, sisal, hemp or manila not more than three-sixteenths of an inch in\ndiameter. If the pot or trap is constructed of nylon, polypropylene, or any\nother synthetic fiber mesh netting placed over the frame, the escape panel may\nbe made by having a section of the mesh netting on the outside of the parlor\nsection comprised of an untreated natural fiber which when rotted out or\ndeteriorated will leave an opening of at least the size specified for an escape\npanel in this subdivision. (3)\n\nThe\nsizes specified for escape vents and panels in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision are minimum sizes and no penalty will be assessed if a person uses\na lobster pot or trap with larger escape vents or panels. (d) Lobster trap tags. (1)\n\nEffective June 1, 2000, all lobster pots\nor traps in use or on board any vessel must be marked by a color-coded trap tag\nissued by the Department of Environmental Conservation or by a vendor or\nanother state or Federal agency recognized by the department for this purpose. Such tag must be firmly attached to the pot or trap and must indicate, for\ncommercial permit holders, the state issuing the tag, the lobster management\narea for which the tag is valid, the year issued, and the permit number of the\nindividual issued the New York lobster permit applicable to that pot or trap. For noncommercial permit holders, the tag shall indicate the state issuing the\ntag, the year issued, and a recreational designation. New tags will be issued\nannually and must be affixed to each pot or trap in use not later than June 1st\nof each calendar year. (2)\n\nLobster\nmanagement area qualifying criteria. Lobster trap tag applicants shall identify in their annual\nlobster license application all lobster management areas, as established by the\n\nAtlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, in which they intend to set their\npots or traps. The department shall issue trap tags to New York lobster permit\nholders who intend to fish in lobster management areas 2, 3, 4 and/or 6 only. In addition, the following restrictions shall apply: (i) Applicants for LMAs 2, 3 and 4 shall be\nallocated trap tags in accordance with criteria established by the Atlantic\n\nStates Marine Fisheries Commission and applicable Federal\nregulations. (ii)\n\nApplicants for\nLMA 6 shall present proof to the department, in accordance with this section, of their participation in the lobster fishery in area 6 between January 1, 1995\nand June 8, 1998 to qualify for the historical trap tag allocation. Initial\ntrap tag allocation shall be based on the historical level of the maximum\nnumber of pots or traps fished during the period January 1, 1995 through June\n8, 1998. (iii)\n\nApplicants for more\nthan one LMA shall abide by the trap tag allocation for the LMA with most\nrestrictive trap tag limit of those identified on the lobster license\napplication. (iv)\n\nApplicants for\nlobster trap tags shall stipulate in their application that they have not\napplied for nor received trap tags from any other lobster trap tag issuing\njurisdiction. (3)\n\nIn the\nyears following the initial allocation, trap tags will be issued to a permit\nholder in an amount requested up to the initial years allocation. However, the\nnumber of trap tags allocated to a permittee shall be permanently reduced by\nthe number of such trap tags initially allocated to the permittee which was\nsold to the New York State Empire State Development Corporation and which the\n\nEmpire State Development Corporation has certified to the department. (i) There shall be an additional 10 percent\nroutine loss allowance added to this amount to provide for lost or damaged gear\nduring the trap tag year. (ii)\n\nFor\nlicense holders identifying LMA 6B as their primary fishing area, an additional\n15 percent routine loss allowance will be granted upon request. This additional\nallocation shall be solely for the use in LMA 6B and shall be so\nindicated. (iii)\n\nIf the routine\nloss allowance is completely used without a catastrophic loss having occurred, a permit holder may obtain a replacement number of tags equal to the number of\nunusable tags turned in to the department. (iv)\n\nTags turned in for such replacement will\nbe reissued with the same identifying information as on those tags being\nreplaced. (4)\n\nThe\nhistorical level of pots or traps fished for the initial allocation will be\ndetermined by the department based on the following: (i) a Federal fishing vessel trip report form\nfor the qualifying period, if available; and\n(ii)\na signed affidavit form, supplied by the\ndepartment, from the permit holder attesting to the number of pots or traps and\nareas fished during any one year of the qualifying periods but no more than: (a) the number of pots or traps indicated on\nthe 1998 lobster permit application form; or\n(b) the greater number of pots which can be\nverified during the qualifying period by: (1)\na license application form for an earlier year in the qualifying period; and/or\n(2)\nif requested by the\ndepartment, receipts or canceled checks for the sale of lobsters, the purchase\nof bait for lobster pots or traps, and the purchase of actual pots or traps, and forms for income tax and observer trips made for lobster on an applicants\nvessel, which provide verification for the number of pots or traps being\nclaimed in the affidavit; or\n(3)\nan\nallocation by the department of 50 pots provided that the permit holder\nreported landing lobsters during the qualifying period. (5)\n\nThe historical level of pots or traps\nfished, as determined by the department, may be appealed by any person on the\nbasis of verifiable information supplied by the appellant. The department may\npublish a notice providing a 30 day public comment period on both the lobster\ntrap allocations requested by the commercial lobster permit holders, and the\ndepartment's initial determinations. (6)\n\nThe department or an agent authorized by\nthe department will issue the trap tags to an individual lobster permit holder\nbased on the department's determination of historical participation for\ncommercial lobster permit holders pursuant to paragraph (4) or (5) of this\nsubdivision and on application for up to five tags by a non-commercial lobster\npermit holder. The fee for such trap tags will be established annually by the\ndepartment and shall be paid in full before the permittee receives their tag\nallocation for the current year. (7)\n\nAnnual trap tags will be issued from\n\nJanuary 1st to May 31st of each year and must be firmly attached to any lobster\npot or trap in use by June 1st. Tags issued under this section will be\nnontransferable and must be permanently attached to the lobster pot or trap\nframe, clearly visible for inspection. (8)\n\nIf there is a catastrophic loss of trap\ntags due to unexpected conditions in the fishery during a year, a permit holder\nwill, upon application to the department, be issued a new allotment of trap\ntags for the remainder of that year which will be distinguished from the\noriginal tags (\ni.e., color). (i) Replacement trap tags must be placed on\nall pots or traps within 10 days after issuance. (ii)\n\nOriginal tags will not be valid after a\nperiod of 10 days following issuance of replacement tags. (iii)\n\nShould there be extensive, area wide\ncatastrophic losses or should replacement tags not be immediately available, the department may issue an exemption notice suspending trap tag requirements\nfor appropriate permit holders for a period not to exceed two months. (9)\n\nIn the event that a lobster\nlicense is reissued to an immediate family member pursuant to section 13-0328\nof the Environmental Conservation Law, the new license holder\n(\ni.e., transferee) shall be eligible to receive the trap tag\nallocation of the former license holder (\ni.e., transferor). This trap tag allocation shall only be used in the approved lobster management\narea (LMA) of the former license holder. (10)\n\nThe Director, Division of Marine\n\nResources, is authorized to implement and administer the policies and\nprocedures set forth in this section, on behalf of the department, which are\nnecessary for the issuance of lobster trap tags pursuant to Environmental\n\nConservation Law section\n13-0329. (e) Temporary emergency authorization\nto tend gear. (1)\n\nIn the event that a\nlobster license holder experiences a temporary medical emergency which renders\nthe license holder incapable of operating an endorsed vessel or conducting\nfishing operations on a non-endorsed vessel, the license holder may apply to\nthe department in writing for permission to authorize another lobster license\nholder to tend the applicant's lobster gear. If the department approves such\napplication, the department shall issue a letter of authorization which shall\nbe carried by the party authorized to tend the applicant's gear at all time\nwhile conducting activities authorized by such letter. (i) A temporary medical emergency shall only\nbe approved for 30 days, and may be extended in 30-day increments. No more than\n12 such 30-day extensions shall be granted for a specific temporary medical\nemergency. (ii)\nA doctor's\nevaluation shall accompany each request for authorization under this section\nand each 30-day extension thereof. The medical evaluation shall be specific as\nto why the disability is temporary and why the licensee can not perform the\nfunctions needed to comply with the law without the requested relief. If the\nmedical evaluation calls for additional evaluation or treatment, the licensee\nshall provide evidence to the department that the licensee made good faith\nefforts to pursue such further evaluation or treatment during the 30-day\nperiod, in order to qualify for an extension pursuant to this\nsubdivision. (iii)\n\nThe Director, Division of Marine Resources, is authorized to grant approvals and\nauthorizations pursuant to this subdivision. (f) Lobster size limits. (1)\n\nAfter January 1, 2004, no person shall\npossess or land any lobster with a carapace less than three and three-eighths\ninches in length while or in the New York State waters of LMA 4. (2)\n\nNo person shall possess or land, in New\n\nYork State waters of LMA 4, any lobster with a carapace which exceeds five and\none-quarter inches in length. (3)\n\nAll applicants for a New York State commercial lobster permit or New York State\nlobster landing license shall designate which of the lobster management areas\nthey choose to fish in for the time period in which the permit is valid. Designated LMAs cannot be changed until the following permit year. Applicants\nwill only be allowed to designate LMAs that they are qualified to fish in\naccording to the criteria specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Permittees who designate more than one LMA in their application shall abide by\nthe lobster size and possession limits of the most restrictive of the\ndesignated LMAs, regardless of where they are fishing. Any person who possesses\nmore than one commercial lobster permit shall abide by the lobster size and\npossession limits of the most restrictive of the LMAs designated on all of\ntheir permits, regardless of where they are fishing. Any permittee who fails to\ndesignate an LMA on their application shall abide by the most restrictive of\nthe LMA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and OCC lobster size and possession limits. The\ndepartment shall provide license holders written notice of the current lobster\nsize and possession limits of LMA 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6\nannually. (g) Mandatory v-notching. (1)\n\nPermittees who designate more than one LMA in their lobster permit application\nshall abide by the V-notching rules of the most restrictive of the designated\nLMAs, regardless of where they are fishing. Any person who possesses more than\none commercial lobster permit shall abide by the V-notching rules of the most\nrestrictive of the LMAs designated on all of their permits, regardless of where\nthey are fishing. Any permittee who fails to designate an LMA on their\napplication shall abide by the most restrictive of the LMAs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and Outer Cape Cod (OCC) V-notching rules. The department shall provide license\nholders written notice of the current V-notching rules of LMAs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nand OCC annually. (2)\n\nThe landing\nor possession of any V-notched female lobster is prohibited. This prohibition\napplies to all persons other than a final purchaser or\nconsumer. (h) Season closure. (1)\n\nThe harvest\nand landing of lobsters from LMA 4 is prohibited from April 30th through May\n31st. (2)\n\nDuring the April 30th\nthrough May 31st closure, lobster permit holders who use lobster traps or pots\nmay set un-baited lobster traps or pots one week prior to the end of the closed\nseason. No lobster trap or pot may be in the water from April 30th to May 24th, unless the lobster permit holder also holds appropriate license(s) to harvest\nother species from his or her traps or pots.
