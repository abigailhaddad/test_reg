Tit. 18 § 530.1 - Basic policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For admissions on or after January 1, 1988, payment for inpatient services will\nbe based on a prospective case payment reimbursement system in accordance with\n10 NYCRR Part\n86. Hospitals or hospital units that are exempt from the Medicare\nprospective system are exempt from this case payment system and will continue\nto be paid on a per diem basis. In addition, designated acquired immune\ndeficiency syndrome (AIDS) units and alcohol rehabilitation units are also\nexempt, as described in 10 NYCRR\n86-1.57, and will be paid on a per diem\nbasis. (b) In addition to the case\npayment rate, a hospital may receive a long length of stay outlier payment\ncalculated pursuant to 10 NYCRR\n86-1.55\n(b), a high cost outlier payment\ncalculated pursuant to 10 NYCRR\n86-1.55\n(c), or an alternative level of care\npayment calculated pursuant to 10 NYCRR\n86-1.56, if the conditions for such\npayments, as set forth in 10 NYCRR Part\n86, are satisfied. Further, in lieu of\ncase-based rates of payments, a hospital may receive a short length of stay\noutlier payment calculated pursuant to 10 NYCRR\n86-1.55\n(a) or a transfer\npayment calculated pursuant to 10 NYCRR\n86\n-\n1.54\n(l) if the conditions for such\npayments, as set forth in 10 NYCRR Part\n86, are satisfied. (c) The date of admission or the date of\ndischarge may be counted as a day of care but in no instance will both the day\nof admission and the day of discharge be reimbursable. (d) A hospital may be reimbursed for an\ninterim billing on the basis of an inpatient admission, reconciled to final\npayment on the basis of discharge date, with such reconciliations established\nat time periods specified by the department. Under such a system, variances\nbetween amounts paid on an admission basis and actual amounts due and to be\npaid on a discharge basis may be reflected in the amounts to be paid on an\nadmission basis. The failure by a hospital to submit a discharge bill within\nthe time period specified by the department will result in the recovery of the\namount paid on an admission basis. (e) If welfare districts plan to pay\nhospitals for X-ray, laboratory, electrocardiogram, metabolism and related\nservices for outpatients on a fee-for-service basis, the costs of operating\nthese services for outpatients must be excluded from the statement of operating\ncosts upon which the per diem rate for inpatient care is based. (f) Hospital care is reimbursable for State\ncharges for the entire approved period of hospital care when such care is\nrendered pursuant to section\n505.4\nof this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n530.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
