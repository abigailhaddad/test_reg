  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 847.3 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words, or phrases hereinafter\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters Index Number as appearing in table\nI shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been assigned to any\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof for the purpose of\nidentification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index\nsystem used to identify specific waters of New York State was adopted from that\nused by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological survey\nseries of reports on the watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name or\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes or ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Lake Ontario watershed in 1939 and has been closely followed in connection\nwith the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on the older maps employed by the Conservation Department at\nthe time of its 1939 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams and ponds not shown on the older maps but appearing\non the newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Lake Ontario drainage basin may be illustrated\nas follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\n\nOnt. Lake Ontario\n\nPrimary waters. Ont. 99\n\nFourmile Creek\n\nThe 99th tributary entering Lake Ontario numbering\nclockwise from the mouth at Tibbetts Point. Ont. 107\n\nShipbuilders Creek\n\nThe 107th tributary entering Lake Ontario numbering\nclockwise from the mouth at Tibbetts Point. Ont. 107-P 112a\n\nUnnamed Pond\n\nIndicates that this body of water is within or\nadjacent to Shipbuilders Creek sub-basin and follows the 112th pond encountered\nin the waters index system. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries shall mean any stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, pond, or\nother body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are\nmentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond, or other body of water designated by such waters index number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after the waters index\nnumber, the specifically designated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water designated by such waters index number and\nall tributaries and subtributaries thereof which are shown on the reference\nmaps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\ngenerally known and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of\nspecifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to which\nthe unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as possible. (e) Description\nas appearing\nin table I shall mean a brief indication as to the location of the specifically\ndesignated waters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of\nwaters to which a particular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also included in this column is any useful information pertinent to the\nclassification or standards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I means map reference\nnumber and indicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced\nherein completely, or in part in section\n847.9, infra, on\nwhich maps the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown\nwithin the topographical limit line of the described drainage basin.
