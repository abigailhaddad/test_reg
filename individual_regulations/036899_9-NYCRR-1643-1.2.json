  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1643-1.2 - Borrowing from the State\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Permanent financing. The permanent financing of State-aided projects is\nachieved through the issue, by the State, of its housing bonds. These bonds\nrepresent direct and general obligations of the State of New York, rather than\nthose of the local agency. The local agency is, however, bound by the loan\ncontract not only to repay the sums it has borrowed from the State, with\ninterest, but also to make the payments of principal and interest at such times\nand in such amounts as will enable the State to meet the charges for interest\nand amortization on the bond issue. (See Part 1644, Debt Service.) As evidence\nof its indebtedness for advances made by the State out of the proceeds of a\nbond issue, the local agency issues its certificate of indebtedness. The timing\nof the issue of bonds by the State is entirely within the discretion of the\n\nState Comptroller, subject to the limitations, described hereafter, of the\n\nState Finance Law with respect to the refunding of short-term notes issued by\nthe State, and of Public Housing Law with respect to the refunding of\nshort-term notes issued by the local agency. (b) Temporary financing. The method of\ntemporary financing which will be employed in connection with the development\nof a given project is, again, entirely within the discretion of the State\n\nComptroller. Short term notes issued by the State in connection with temporary\nfinancing may have a maturity not in excess of one year from the date of issue\nand may be refunded, upon maturity, through the sale of similar short-term\nnotes. The State Finance Law, however, places a limitation of two years, from\nthe respective dates of original issue, on the period during which such\nrefunding operations may be conducted. Eventually, short-term notes issued by\nthe State to raise funds to be advanced to local agencies for project\ndevelopment are refunded out of the proceeds of a housing bond issue by the\n\nState, but they may also be refunded, prior to the issue of bonds, out of the\nproceeds of an issue of short-term notes by the local agency direct to private\ninvestors. No refunding or short-term notes may occur after bonds have been\nissued for same. The evidence of the local agency's indebtedness to the State, when the advances by the State represent the proceeds of an issue of short-term\nnotes by the State, is a certificate of indebtedness, identical in form with\nthe certificate of indebtedness issued for the proceeds of a bond\nissue. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1643-1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
