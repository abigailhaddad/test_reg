Tit. 19 § 160.37 - Examination interpreters\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf an examination is not available in the applicant's\nlanguage at the time of application, an examinee who is not fluent in the\n\nEnglish language may provide for an interpreter to accompany him or her to the\nexamination. Such interpreter must be fluent in both the examinee's native\nlanguage and English. The department may refuse entrance to any interpreter who\npossesses specialized knowledge in appearance enhancement or barber disciplines\nor who has previously provided interpretive services within a three-month\nperiod. Prior to entrance an examinee and interpreter will be required to\nverify such facts and an interpreter will be required to present three forms of\nidentification acceptable to the department.
