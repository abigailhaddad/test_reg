  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 9-4.3 - Qualified financial instrument apportionment rules for non-captive REITs and non-captive RICs\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A)\n\nWhen computing the business apportionment factor, non-captive REITs and non-captive RICs must use the following rules regarding\nqualified financial instruments in lieu of the rules specified in section\n4-2.4\nof this Subchapter. (a) For purposes of this section, a\n\"qualified financial instrument\" means a financial instrument, other than a\nfinancial instrument listed in subdivision (b) of this section, that is of a\ntype described in one of the following clauses of section 210-A(5)(a)(2): clause (A)-loans; clause (B)-state, and municipal debt; clause (C)-asset backed\nsecurities and other government agency debt; clause (D)-corporate bonds; clause\n(G)-dividends and net gains from sales of stock or partnership interests; clause (H)-other financial instruments; clause (I)-commodities. (b) The following financial instruments are\nnot qualified financial instruments, even if they are of a type described in\nsubdivision (a) of this section: (1)\na loan\nsecured by real property; (2)\na\nfinancial instrument that is investment capital; and\n(3)\nstock that generates other exempt\nincome. (c) Except as\nprovided in subdivision (d) of this section, the amount of receipts, net income\n(not less than zero) and net gains (not less than zero) from qualified\nfinancial instruments included in New York receipts or everywhere receipts is\ndetermined using the customer sourcing method contained in section\n210-A(5)(a)(2), and further described in this section. (d) (1)\n\nNon-captive REITs and non-captive RICs may elect the fixed percentage method to\ninclude 8% of net income (not less than zero) from qualified financial\ninstruments in New York receipts and 100% of net income (not less than zero)\nfrom qualified financial instruments in everywhere receipts. The election may\nbe made whether or not such net income would otherwise be included in New York\nreceipts or everywhere receipts pursuant to the provisions of section\n210-A(5)(a)(2). (2)\n\nNet income from\nqualified financial instruments is the sum of: (i) net gains (not less than zero) from each\ntype of qualified financial instrument that would be subject to the same\ncustomer sourcing method in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and Part 4 of this\n\nSubchapter if not for the fixed percentage method; (ii)\nnet income (not less than zero) from\neach type of qualified financial instrument that would be subject to the same\ncustomer sourcing method in section 210-A(5)(a)(2) and Part 4 of this\n\nSubchapter, if not for the fixed percentage method; and\n(iii)\nreceipts from each type of qualified\nfinancial instrument. (3)\n\nThe fixed percentage method election must\nbe made annually and must be made on an original, timely filed report, determined with regard to extensions for time for filing. Any fixed percentage\nmethod election made on a report that is filed late will be invalid and\nineffective. (4)\n\nOnce the fixed\npercentage method election has been made in the manner required in paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision for a taxable year, it is binding on the taxpayer and\nthe department for such taxable year and cannot be revoked or\noverridden. (e) Example. Corporation X is a non-captive RIC. It elects to use the\nfixed percentage method in the manner required by paragraph (3) of subdivision\n(d) of this section to determine the amount of its net income (not less than\nzero) from qualified financial instruments to include in New York receipts and\neverywhere receipts. Its income does not qualify as other exempt income or\nincome from investment capital. Corporation X has $1,000 in dividends from Stock A; ($200) loss from the sale of Stock B; $750 gain from the sale of corporate bond\nC, which was sold through a licensed exchange; $25,000 gain from the sale of\ncorporate bond D, which was not sold through a registered securities broker or\ndealer or through a licensed exchange; $5,000 gain from the sale of debt\nobligation E, which was issued by Country Y; ($2,000) loss from the sale of\ndebt obligation F, which was issued by Country Z; and $2,000 of interest from\ndeposit accounts. Corporation X has $31,750 of net income (not less than\nzero) from qualified financial instruments included in everywhere receipts\nbroken down as follows: * $1,000 of dividends from stock; * $0 of gains from sales of stock (as the loss is limited\nto zero); * $750 of gains from sales of bonds sold through a\nlicensed exchange or registered securities broker or dealer; * $25,000 of gains from sales of bonds not sold through a\nlicensed exchange or registered securities broker or dealer; * $3,000 of gains from one type of other financial\ninstrument (debt obligations issued by a country, or political subdivision\nthereof, other than the United States); and\n* $2,000 of interest from one type of other financial\ninstrument (deposit accounts). Corporation X includes $2,540 (8% multiplied by $31,750)\nfrom qualified financial instruments in its New York receipts and $31,750 in\nits everywhere receipts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
