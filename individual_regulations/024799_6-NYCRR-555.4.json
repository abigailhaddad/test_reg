  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 555.4 - Permanent abandonment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It shall be unlawful for the owner or\noperator of any well to permanently plug and abandon same until he has given\nnotice at least 10 days in advance of the commencement of plugging operations\nto the department on form OG11, which is to be filed in triplicate, and has\nreceived a permit from the department therefor on form OG12. During the period\nwhile abandonment operations are in progress, this permit must be posted at the\nwell site so as to be clearly visible and legible at all times. (b) Upon receipt of the notice of intention\nto abandon, the department will send the permit therefor to the owner or\noperator or person responsible for the plugging operations and arrange for a\nrepresentative to be present at the well to witness the plugging operations. The permit will contain a confirmation of the well location and date and time\nof the commencement of the plugging operation as specified by the owner or\noperator on form OG11. If the representative of the department is not at the\nwell site at the specified date and time, the operator may proceed to plug and\nabandon the well without waiting for official witness. (c) In the event the well to be plugged and\nabandoned is one upon which the drilling or rework operations have been in\nprogress on a continuous basis as authorized or acknowledged by the department\non form OG9 as provided in Part 552, the notice of intention to abandon may be\ngiven verbally or by telegram to the regional headquarters administering to the\ncounty in which the well is located. In such event, the regional headquarters\nwill acknowledge receipt of the notice of intention to abandon either verbally\nor by telegram. Although this procedure shall be allowed to prevent excessive\nwaiting time, the owner or operator still must provide the department with\nformal notice of intention to abandon utilizing form OG11 as promptly as is\nreasonably possible, and will be furnished with a permit on form\nOG12. (d) In an emergency or where\ncompliance with the normal procedure of 10 days advance notification to the\ndepartment of a planned permanent plugging and abandonment of a well clearly\nwill cause undue hardship upon the owner or operator, the notice of intention\nto abandon may be given verbally to the department (normally to the regional\nheadquarters administering to the county in which the well is located). In such\nevent the notice of intention to abandon will be acknowledged verbally or by\ntelegram. Although this procedure shall be allowed in an emergency or to\nprevent undue hardship, the owner or operator still must provide the department\nwith formal notice of intention to abandon utilizing form OG11 as promptly as\nis reasonably possible, and will be furnished with a permit on form\nOG12.
