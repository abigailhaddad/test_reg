If a plan is required, the facility must\nsubmit the plan according to a schedule and format established by the\n\nDepartment. Alternatively, the facility may, after fulfilling the requirements\nof sections 7.2 through 7.4 of this Subpart, choose to submit a corrective\naction plan for responding to contaminated soil and groundwater. In either\ncase, the facility is responsible for submitting a plan that provides for\nadequate protection of public health and the environment as determined by the\n\nDepartment, and must modify the facility's plan as necessary to meet this\nstandard. (b) The Department will\napprove the corrective action plan only after ensuring that implementation of\nthe plan will adequately protect public health, safety, and the environment. In\nmaking this determination, the Department will consider the following factors\nas appropriate: (1)\nthe physical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the petroleum, including its toxicity, persistence, and\npotential for migration; (2)\nthe\nhydrogeologic characteristics of the facility and the surrounding\narea; (3)\nthe proximity, quality, and current and future uses of nearby surface water and groundwater; (4)\nthe potential effects of residual\ncontamination on nearby surface water and groundwater; (5)\nan exposure assessment; and\n(6)\nany information assembled in compliance\nwith this Subpart. (c) Upon approval of the corrective action plan or as directed by the Department, the facility must implement the plan, including modifications to the plan made\nby the Department. The facility must monitor, evaluate, and report the results\nof implementing the plan in accordance with a schedule and in a format\nestablished by the Department. (d) The facility may, in the interest of minimizing environmental contamination and\npromoting more effective cleanup, begin cleanup of soil and groundwater before\nthe corrective action plan is approved provided that the facility: (1)\nnotifies the Department of the facility's\nintention to begin cleanup; (2)\ncomplies with any conditions imposed by the Department, including halting\ncleanup or mitigating adverse consequences from cleanup activities; and\n(3)\nincorporates these\nself-initiated cleanup measures in the corrective action plan that is submitted\nto the Department for approval.
