  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 822.11 - Additional requirements for opioid treatment programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Central registry system. Each such\nprogram must participate in the central registry system established and\nmaintained by the Office to prevent a patient's simultaneous enrollment in more\nthan one such program and ensure accurate dispensing of medication in\naccordance with federal regulations. Each such program must: (1)\ninitiate a clearance inquiry to the\ncentral registry system by submitting all required information prior to\nadmitting a patient; (2)\nreport\nall admissions, transfers, and discharges immediately to the central registry\nsystem; (3)\nverify with the\ncentral registry system that the prospective patient is not presently enrolled\nin another such program and this verification must be documented in the\nclinical record; a program may not admit an applicant who is participating in\nanother such program; and\n(4)\nreport any other information deemed necessary by the Office to comply with\nstate and federal laws and regulations. (b) Medication administration. (1)\nA physician must determine a patient's\ninitial medication dose and schedule of administration and document such orders\nin the patient's record. Another designated practitioner, such as a nurse\npractitioner or physician's assistant may determine a patient's initial\nmedication dose and schedule of administration if a federal waiver has been\napproved. (2)\nA prescribing\nprofessional may report such orders to the registered or licensed medical\npersonnel supervising medication administration; any subsequent change in\napproved medications, dose or schedule must similarly be reported to the\npharmacy or to the medical staff and documented in the record before\nadministration. The prescribing professional may issue verbal orders in\nemergencies only and must document such orders in writing within seventy-two\n(72) hours. (3)\n\nPatients must be\nproperly stabilized with a therapeutic dose of approved medications; a\ntherapeutic dose means an amount sufficient to maintain comfort for at least\ntwenty-four (24) hours, alleviate opioid craving and stop continued opioid use. Split medication doses require prior Office approval. (4)\n\nIf any medical staff member observes any\ncondition or behavior on the part of a patient that may contraindicate a\nregularly scheduled dose of medication, such staff member must contact the\nprescribing professional immediately and advise of the patient's condition\nwhich may warrant an approved medication delay, withholding or adjustment. The\nprescribing professional must: (i) approve\nany medication delay, withholding or adjustment; and\n(ii)\nprovide follow up consistent with\nemergency verbal orders as otherwise required by this\nsection. (c) Unsupervised or take-home medication. (1)\n\nEach\npatient must be on a visit schedule that is most appropriate to clinical need, conducive to treatment progress, and supportive of rehabilitation. A\nprescribing professional may reduce a patient's visit schedule, when clinically\nindicated, to accommodate patient changes in need, progress, or\nrehabilitation. (2)\n\nEach patient's\ntake-home schedule must comply with the federal regulatory time in treatment\nrequirements (42 CFR Part\n8.12), unless there is a clinical justification that\ntakes into consideration the federal eight (8) point criteria, as to why the\nperson is not stable enough to be granted the applicable take home schedule. The Medical Director must review and confirm the appropriateness for take-home\nmedication. Federal time in treatment criteria do not apply to the provision of\nbuprenorphine or naltrexone. (3)\n\nAny patient may receive a single take-home dose for a day that the clinic is\nclosed for business, including Sundays and State and Federal\nholidays. (4)\n\nSuch determinations\nshall be documented in the patient's medical record. Time-in-treatment\nrequirements do not apply to buprenorphine take-home medication per federal\nrules. (5)\n\nNo medications shall be\ndispensed to patients in short-term detoxification treatment or interim\nmaintenance treatment for unsupervised or take-home use. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding the requirements of this\nsubdivision, a provider may require a patient to visit the program when\nconcerned with diversion of medication. When this occurs the patient shall be\nrequired to bring in all remaining take-home doses. Remaining doses must match\nthe prescribed schedule. (7)\n\nHolidays. Notwithstanding the requirements of this subdivision, a patient may\nbe provided with extra medication without prior Office approval i f the\npatient's next regular visit falls on a legal or program holiday. Designation\nof a program holiday that is not a federal holiday must be approved annually by\nthe Office at least thirty (30) days in advance. (8)\n\nExceptional circumstances. Notwithstanding the requirements of\nthis subdivision, a prescribing professional, based on reasonable clinical\njudgment, may order up to thirty (30) takehome doses at any one time if a\npatient is unable to conform to the applicable mandatory schedule requirements\ndue to exceptional circumstances such as illness, personal or family crisis, travel, employment, medical, or hardship, and the prescribing professional\ndetermines the patient is also responsible in handling approved medication. Such order shall not be a permanent schedule change. The prescribing\nprofessional must immediately document in the patient record the reasons for\nthe order. (9)\n\nRelease of\nmedication to designated third party. Program medical staff may release\nmedication to a designated third party other than the patient only when the\npatient is physically unable to attend the program. The decision to permit such\nrelease to a designated third party must be based on the clinical judgment of\nthe prescribing professional and with the consent of the patient, both of which\nmust be documented in the patient's record. All designated third parties must\nalso receive prior Office approval. (10)\n\nPatients readmitted to a program after an approved voluntary\ndischarge may be granted the same take-home schedule at the time of discharge\nprovided all criteria other than length of treatment are\nsatisfied. (d) Medication\nsecurity. (1)\n\nAccess to controlled\nsubstances, including approved medications, shall be limited to authorized\npersons in accordance with applicable state and federal law. The areas where\ncontrolled medication stocks are maintained, dispensed, or administered must be\nphysically separated and secure from patient areas in accordance with\napplicable state and federal law. (2)\n\nImmediately after administration, drug containers must be\npurged by rinsing, inversion, or by an acceptable alternative method that must\neffectively prevent the accumulation of residual medication. Containers used in\nthe program or for take-home medications must be in child resistant packaging, may not be reused and must be destroyed. Each program must assure patients'\ntake-home bottles and used containers are disposed of properly. Patients should\nreturn take-home bottles before receiving any subsequent take-home\nmedication. (3)\n\nAny theft or loss\nof approved medications must be immediately reported in accordance with\napplicable state and federal law. (e) Residential programs providing opioid full agonist treatment\nmedications. Such a residential program shall: (1)\ncomply with all applicable requirements of this\n\nPart; (2)\ncomply with all\nrequirements of this Title applicable to substance use disorder residential\nservices; (3)\nnot dispense\ntake-home medications to any patient; and\n(4)\ninclude material and schedules for development and review of\ntreatment/recovery plans as required by regulations applicable to substance use\ndisorder residential services, rather than the requirements of this\n\nPart. (f) Opioid taper. (1)\nMAT is the standard of care for OUD; however an opioid taper may be appropriate in limited clinical situations and\nupon patient request. (2)\n\nVoluntary\n\nTaper. Each program must provide an opioid taper at the program or arrange for\ntaper at another program or in a facility approved to provide tapering as is\nmedically and clinically appropriate: (i) Patients may request a voluntary taper at any time and may discuss reasons and\ncircumstances with program staff who must provide clinical feedback regarding\npatient readiness. No reasonable request shall be denied; (ii)\n\nEach program must administer a\nvoluntary taper at a pace tailored to the patient's individual needs, based on\nclinical judgment, medical evaluation, patient input and feedback at the start\nof the taper and continuously throughout. (g) Opioid medical maintenance (OMM). (1)\n\nAn OMM program requires federal and state\napproval. Patients admitted to OMM must meet specific criteria including: (i) four (4) years of continuous treatment in\na program providing opioid full agonist treatment; (ii)\nthree (3) years of no substance use\nincluding alcohol; (iii)\nthree (3)\nyears of no criminal involvement; (iv)\nthree (3) years of continuous gainful employment or\nproductive activity; (v) three (3)\nyears of emotional stability; (vi)\nintent to continue maintenance treatment; and\n(vii)\nverified stability in the Prescription Monitoring Program\n(\"PMP\"). (2)\n\nThe\nindividual patient record for a patient in OMM must be updated at least monthly\nand toxicology tests and/or a check of the PMP must be conducted as clinically\nindicated. (3)\n\nThe 30-day\nmedication supply may be dispensed in dry tablet form in a single\nbottle. (4)\n\nAn OMM patient must\nreturn to a program when, in the prescribing professional's clinical judgment, the patient needs maintenance treatment services. (5)\n\nAn OMM program has no Office-certified\ncapacity. (h) Specialized\nopioid services. Specialized opioid services are those not defined in this Part\nand are generally research-oriented in nature. Such specialized services shall\nbe reviewed and approved by the Office prior to implementation and operation in\naccordance with Office policy, procedures, and\nrequirements. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
