(b) Any user may discontinue water service by giving the water board written\nnotice, on forms supplied and approved by the commissioner, not less than 10\ndays prior to the discontinuance. Upon the commissioner's acceptance of such\nnotice, all liability for charges for service rendered after the discontinuance\nof service as herein provided for shall cease. Upon discontinuance of\nnon-metered flat rate water service, the water board will refund to the user\nthe pro rata amount of every advance payment for any service after the\ndiscontinuance. Such refund to be based upon the relation of the period after\ndiscontinuance of service to the entire period for which such advance payment\nwas made after deducting the proper charge for any excess water consumed to the\ndate of discontinuance. (c) When\nwater service to any premises has been turned off upon the order of the user or\nfor any of the reasons specified in subdivision (a) of this section and service\nat any premises is again desired by the same user, a reactivation charge as\nspecified in the board's schedule of rates will be made for the restoration of\nservices; providing the discontinuance of service required only the removal of\nthe water board's equipment from the user's premises, the closing of the curb\nstop or turning off the water elsewhere not involving any unusual expense. If, however, in the commissioner's judgment it becomes necessary to protect the\nfacilities or to prevent waste, the commissioner may shut off or disconnect the\nservice pipe at the water board's main, and the user shall be liable to pay for\nrestoration of service in the amount of the real cost incurred by the water\nboard, incident to the disconnection and reconnection of the service\npipe. (d) Upon receipt of an\napplication for new service or for reinstatement of an existing service, the\nwater board will assume that the user service connection and all pipes and\nfixtures connected thereto are in proper working order to receive water. The\nwater board will not be liable in any event for any accident, break or leakage\narising in connection with the supply of water or failure to supply\nsame. (e) Upon certification by the\n\nBuffalo Sewer Authority to the water board that sewer rents, based upon the\nconsumption of water charged against the real property which is connected with\nthe Buffalo Sewer Authority, remain unpaid for a period of more than one year\nfrom the due date thereof, and that notice and demand has been given by the\n\nBuffalo Sewer Authority to the owner or occupant of said premises, by\nregistered or certified mail, addressed to said premises and to the address of\nthe owner as shown on the records of the assessor of the City of Buffalo, to\npay the same within 10 days from the date of the mailing of said notice and\nthat such rents still remain unpaid, the commissioner shall shut off the supply\nof water to said premises until the sewer rents are paid, together with any\nother charges due to the Buffalo Sewer Authority and reactivation fee and/or\nreal costs incurred by the water board to restore service to said\npremises.
