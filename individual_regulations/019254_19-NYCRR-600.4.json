  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 600.4 - Initial review of actions\n\nState Regulations\n\nAs early as possible in a State agency's formulation of an\naction it proposes to undertake, or as soon as a State agency receives an\napplication for a funding or approval action, it shall determine whether the\naction is located within the coastal area. For purposes of this Part, planning\nor rulemaking actions which affect land or water in the coastal area shall be\ndeemed to be located therein. At the time it is determined that the action is\nlocated within the coastal area the State agency shall follow the review\nprocedures set forth in this Part, including the completion of a coastal\nassessment form (CAF) in a form prescribed by the Secretary. The CAF shall be\ncompleted prior to the agency's determination of significance pursuant to SEQR\n(6 NYCRR Part\n617\n) so that it can then supplement other information used by\n\nState agencies in making determinations of significance pursuant to such Part\n617. If it is determined that an action will not have a significant effect on\nthe environment, the CAF is intended to assist State agencies in arriving at\ntheir decision as to certification if required by this section. Where any\nquestion on the CAF is answered yes, a brief and precise description of the\nnature and extent of the action shall be provided on the CAF, and a copy of the\nCAF forwarded to the Secretary; provided, however, this requirement does not\napply to permit actions unless such actions involve Federal review, funding, or\napproval. For the purposes of complying with the requirements of Executive Law\narticle 42, State agencies shall meet the requirements of either subdivision\n(a), (b) or (c) of this section, whichever applies. (a) Where a determination is made pursuant to\n6 NYCRR Part\n617\nthat an action may have a significant effect on the\nenvironment, the agency shall comply with the requirements of 6 NYCRR\n617.9\n(b)(5)(vi) and 617.11(e). Fulfilling such requirements constitutes a\ndetermination of consistency as required by Executive Law article 42. (b) Where a determination is made pursuant to\n6 NYCRR Part\n617, that an action will not have a significant effect on the\nenvironment, and where a State agency is undertaking a direct or funding\naction, other than rulemaking, the State agency, at the time of making its\ndecision on the action shall file with the Secretary a certification that such\naction will not substantially hinder the achievement of any of the coastal\npolicies set forth in section 600.5 or\n600.6\nof this Part for actions\nwithin the Long Island Sound coastal area, and whenever practicable will\nadvance one or more of such policies. If the action will substantially hinder\nthe achievement of any policy, the agency shall instead certify that the\nfollowing four requirements are satisfied: (1)\nno reasonable alternatives exist which\nwould permit the action to be taken in a manner which would not substantially\nhinder the achievement of such policy; (2)\nthe action taken will minimize all\nadverse effects on such policies to the maximum extent practicable; (3)\nthe action will advance one or more of\nthe other coastal policies; and\n(4)\nthe action will result in an overriding regional or statewide public benefit. Such certification shall constitute a determination of\nconsistency as required by Executive Law article 42. (c) Where a determination is made\npursuant to 6 NYCRR Part\n617\nthat an action will not have a significant effect\non the environment, and where the action is in the coastal area within the\nboundaries of an approved local Waterfront Revitalization Program area, and the\naction is one identified by the Secretary pursuant to section\n916\n(1)(a)\nof the Executive Law, a State agency\nshall submit, through appropriate existing clearing house procedures, information on the proposed action to the local government and, at the time of\nmaking its decision on the action, file with the Secretary a certification that\nthe action will not substantially hinder the achievement of any of the policies\nand purposes of the applicable approved local Waterfront Revitalization Program\nand whenever practicable will advance one or more of such policies. If the\naction will substantially hinder the achievement of any policy or purpose of\nthe applicable approved local Waterfront Revitalization Program, the State\nagency shall instead certify that the following three requirements are\nsatisfied: (1)\nno reasonable alternatives\nexist which would permit the action to be taken in a manner which would not\nsubstantially hinder the achievement of such policy or purpose; (2)\nthe action taken will minimize all\nadverse effects on the local policy and purpose to the maximum extent\npracticable; and\n(3)\nthe action\nwill result in an overriding regional or statewide public benefit. Such certification shall constitute a determination that the\naction is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved local\n\nWaterfront Revitalization Program as required by Executive Law article\n42.
