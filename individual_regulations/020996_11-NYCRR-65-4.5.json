(t) Imposition of costs. (1)\n\nEffective with arbitrations filed on and after March 1, 2002, the arbitrator may impose all administrative costs of arbitration to the applicant or apportion the administrative costs of arbitration between the parties if the arbitrator concludes that the applicant's arbitration request was frivolous, was without factual or legal merit, or was filed for the purpose of harassing the respondent. Cases in which arbitrators impose all administrative costs to the applicant shall be excluded from the assessment calculation contained in subdivision (aa) of this section. (2)\n\nThe amount of such administrative costs per case shall be established for each calendar year by the designated organization. The administrative cost shall be based upon the actual administrative costs per case in the prior calendar year. Such costs shall be paid to the designated organization and the receipt of such costs shall be used to reduce the actual expenses of the designated organization for the administration of the arbitration forum.

All other procedures shall be interpreted by the designated organization, subject to consultation with and approval by the superintendent. (x) Alternative legal remedies. The designated organization shall not be made a party to a court proceeding relating to an arbitration award unless the designated organization's presence as a party is pertinent to the issues raised in the litigation. The participation of a party in an arbitration proceeding shall be a waiver of any claim against an arbitrator or the designated organization for any act or omission in connection with any arbitration conducted under these rules. The designated organization shall transmit to the superintendent copies of any legal papers served upon designated organization or an arbitrator, relating to any stay or appeal of an arbitration. (y) Payment of award. Insurers shall, within 30 calendar days of the date of mailing of the award, either pay the amounts set forth in the award or, where grounds exist, appeal to the master arbitrator as provided for in this Part, which appeal shall stay payment of the award. The award need not be confirmed into judgment. (z) Arbitrator's compensation and expenses. At the direction of the superintendent, arbitrators shall contract on an annual basis with the designated organization. The rate of annual compensation shall be determined by the designated organization, after consultation with the no- fault arbitrator screening committee subject to the approval of the superintendent. Arbitrators shall be independent contractors, and shall not be employees or agents of the designated organization or the Insurance Department. (aa)\n\nFinancing. (1)\n\nThe cost of administering the no-fault arbitration forum shall be paid annually by insurers (including self-insurers and MVAIC) to the designated organization upon receipt of a statement therefrom. This cost shall be distributed among insurers in an equitable manner approved by the Superintendent of Insurance. This distribution shall, to the extent practicable, be a function of the degree to which an insurer is named as a respondent in no-fault arbitration forum proceedings. (2)\n\nSemiannually, the designated organization shall prepare a budget of the estimated fees to be incurred for the operation of the no-fault arbitration forum during the subsequent six- month period. The estimated fees of the no-fault arbitration forum shall be assessed on a proportionate basis to those insurers named as respondents on cases forwarded to no-fault arbitration in the preceding calendar year and shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent. The designated organization shall send to each applicable insurer a bill for the amount due and any payment due shall be made to the designated organization within 30 days after billing date. (3)\n\nOn an annual basis, as of December 31st of each year, the designated organization shall prepare a detailed analysis of the fees for the operation of the no-fault arbitration forum. This analysis shall be forwarded to the no-fault optional arbitration advisory committee and the superintendent on or before April 30th of each year. The no-fault optional arbitration advisory committee shall notify the designated organization and the superintendent whether it accepts or rejects the designated organization's fee analysis in whole or in part. In the event that the designated organization and the no-fault optional arbitration advisory committee cannot resolve any differences that may exist, such differences will be referred to the superintendent for resolution. The superintendent's decision shall be binding on the designated organization and insurers. (4)\n\nOnce the designated organization submits a final fee analysis that has either been approved by the no-fault optional arbitration advisory committee or resolved by the superintendent in the event of a dispute, the designated organization shall send to each applicable insurer an accounting of the designated organization's assessment. Any adjustment shall be made to the bill for the subsequent estimated assessment, as illustrated by the following example: EXAMPLE\n(1)\n\nTotal no-fault arbitration forum cases closed during year 6,000\n(2)\n\nCases in which insurer A was named as a respondent in the no-fault arbitration forum proceeding 250\n(3)\n\nInsurer A's assessment percentage = (2)/(1) 4.167%\n(4)\n\nActual expenses of the no-fault arbitration forum $2,500,000\n(5)\n\nInsurer A's actual expense = (3) x (4) $104,175\n(6)\n\nInsurer A's estimated assessment $102,000\n(7)\n\nInsurer A's debit or (credit) = (5) - (6) $2,175\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
