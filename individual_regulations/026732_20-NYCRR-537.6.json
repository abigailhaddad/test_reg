  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 537.6 - Obligations of the Department of Taxation and Finance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Department of Taxation and Finance, upon receipt of a notice of sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of business\nassets from the purchaser, transferee or assignee, will respond, by mailing\nwithin five business days (excluding Saturday, Sunday or a day which is a legal\nholiday in this State) any or all of the following: (1)\nan acknowledgment of the receipt of such\nnotice; (2)\nadvice to the\npurchaser, transferee or assignee that such notice is or is not proper (see\nsection\n537.2\nof this Part); or\n(3)\na notice of\npossible claim to the purchaser, seller and escrow agent, if any, for taxes due\nthe State or a statement that no taxes are due. For the purposes of this subdivision, the date of receipt\nof the notice of sale from the purchaser, transferee or assignee is the date\nthe notice is actually delivered to the Bulk Sales Unit or, if applicable, the\ndate it is deemed received by the Bulk Sales Unit pursuant to section\n537.2\n(c)(6)\nof this Part, whichever date is later, rather than the date of registry or\ncertificate of mail or the date of mailing. (b) If the Division of Taxation fails within\nfive business days to mail a notice of possible claim for taxes due the State, and such purchaser, transferee or assignee has given proper (both as to service\nand contents) and timely notice, the purchaser, transferee or assignee is\nrelieved from his obligation to withhold any funds from the seller, transferrer\nor assignor, and is relieved from liability for taxes due by the seller (except\nthe sales taxes due on the sale of the tangible personal property) except in\nthe situation and to the extent that there are outstanding warrants or\njudgments for unpaid sales tax liability due and owing by the seller. The\nseller, transferrer or assignor, however, is not relieved of any of his\nobligation or liability. If the department has issued a notice of possible\nclaim to a purchaser in response to a notice of sale, an additional notice of\npossible claim will not have to be issued where a revised notice of sale is\nfiled. (c) The Division of Taxation\nwill, within 90 days after receipt of a notice of sale, transfer or assignment\nin bulk of business assets, mail to the purchaser, transferee or assignee and\nthe seller, transferrer or assignor a notice of the total taxes due the State\nor a notice that no taxes are due and the funds withheld may be\nreleased. (d) If the Division of\n\nTaxation fails, within 90 days after receipt of a proper (both as to service\nand contents) notice of sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of business assets\n(whether or not such notice was timely in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision [c] of section\n537.2\nof this Part), to mail a notice of claim for total taxes due from the seller, transferrer or assignor, or fails to mail an authorization for the release of\nfunds withheld by the purchaser, transferee or assignee, the purchaser, transferee or assignee is relieved from both his obligation to further withhold\nsuch funds from the seller, transferrer or assignor and his liability for the\ntaxes due from such seller, transferrer or assignor. However, the seller, transferrer or assignor remains liable. (e) The Department of Taxation and Finance\nwill, upon payment of the taxes due, if any, from the seller, transferrer or\nassignor, issue to the purchaser, transferee or assignee or the escrow agent, if any, an authorization to release funds to which the seller, transferrer or\nassignor may be entitled. Such authorization may limit the amount of such funds\nto be released. (f) When an audit\nhas been performed prior to a sale of business assets as provided for in\nsection\n537.5\nof this Part, the Division of Taxation shall issue a bulk sales tax certificate\nto the seller, transferrer or assignor, indeicating his tax liability up to the\ndate stated on the certificate. Such bulk sales tax certificate, if presented\nby the seller, transferrer or assignor to the purchaser, transferee or\nassignee, serves as proof of the amount of the seller's liability stated\nthereon up to the date indicated upon the certificate. (g) Where the liability of a purchaser, transferee or assignee, for the payment to the State of any such taxes\ndetermined to be due from the seller, transferrer or assignor, has been wholly\npaid or satisfied or no longer exists, the Division of Taxation shall mail to\nsuch purchaser, transferee or assignee a notice, addressed to his last known\naddress, setting forth that such liability has been wholly paid or satisfied or\nno longer exists. The Division of Taxation shall include in such notice the\nfollowing additional information: (1)\nthe\nname and last known address of the purchaser, transferee or assignee; (2)\nthe amount of the lien paid, satisfied or\nvacated; and\n(3)\na statement to the\neffect that consumer reporting agencies must delete from a credit file any\nreference to the particular tax lien within 30 days of receipt from the\npurchaser, transferee or assignee of such notice. However, an order or decree in a bankruptcy proceeding does\nnot give rise to the notice requirements of this subdivision. (h) The following examples\nillustrate the provisions of this section: Example 1:A person purchasing business assets in bulk will\ntake possession of the assets and pay for the same on August 22, 1981. He\neffects personal service of a properly executed notice of sale by having such\nnotice hand-delivered to an officer of the Department of Taxation and Finance\nwho is authorized by the department to accept such service. The notice of sale\nis hand-delivered on August 9, 1981. Since the notice was served at least 10\ndays prior to the date of sale, the notice is timely. However, personal service\nof the notice and the receipt of the notice is deemed to have taken place on\n\nAugust 12, 1981, 10 days prior to the date of sale. The Division of Taxation\nwill mail to the purchaser a notice of possible claim for taxes due the State\non or before August 19, 1981, which date is five business days subsequent to\n\nAugust 12, 1981. Furthermore, the Division of Taxation will mail to the\npurchaser a notice of the total taxes due the State, or a notice that no taxes\nare due and the funds withheld may be released. Such notice will be mailed by\nthe Division of Taxation on or before November 10, 1981, which date is 90 days\nafter August 12, 1981. The failure of the Division of Taxation to send either\nnotice within the appropriate times provided herein will discharge the\npurchaser from liability. However, the seller is not discharged from his\nliability. Example 2:Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except\nthat personal service was effected on August 12, 1981. Since the notice was\nserved at least 10 days prior to the date of sale, the notice is timely. The\nobligations of the Division of Taxation with respect to mailing the notice of\npossible claim for taxes due and the mailing of the notice of the total taxes\ndue are the same as in the above example. Example 3:Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except\nthat the notice of sale is hand-delivered on August 14, 1981. The notice of\nsale is untimely. The Division of Taxation will mail to the purchaser a notice\nof possible claim for taxes due the State, and will attempt to mail the same as\nexpeditiously as possible. Furthermore, the Division of Taxation will mail to\nthe purchaser a notice of the total taxes due the State or a notice that no\ntaxes are due and the funds withheld may be released. Such notice will be\nmailed by the Division of Taxation on or before November 12, 1981, which date\nis 90 days after August 14, 1981. The failure of the Division of Taxation to\nmail such notice on or before November 12, 1981 will discharge the purchaser\nfrom liability. However, the seller is not discharged from his\nliability. Example 4:Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except\nthat the notice of sale is mailed by registered mail on August 14, 1981. The\nnotice of sale is untimely. The obligations of the Division of Taxation with\nrespect to mailing the notice of claim for possible taxes due and the mailing\nof the total taxes due are the same as in the above example. Example 5:A person purchasing business assets in bulk will\ntake possession of the assets and pay for the same on August 22, 1981. He mails\na properly executed notice of the sale by certified mail--return receipt\nrequested--to the Bulk Sales Unit as provided in subdivision (b) of section\n537.2\nof this Part. The postmark date stamped on the sendor's receipt for such mail\nis August 9, 1981. The mail is actually received by the Bulk Sales Unit on\n\nAugust 11, 1981. Since the notice was served at least 10 days prior to the date\nof sale, the notice is timely. However, service of the notice and receipt of\nthe notice is deemed to have taken place on August 12, 1981, 10 days prior to\nthe date of sale. The Division of Taxation will mail to the purchaser a notice\nof possible claim for taxes due the State on or before August 19, 1981, which\ndate is five business days subsequent to August 12, 1981. Furthermore, the\n\nDivision of Taxation will mail to the purchaser a notice of the total taxes due\nthe State or a notice that no taxes are due and the funds withheld may be\nreleased. Such notice will be mailed by the Division of Taxation on or before\n\nNovember 10, 1981, which date is 90 days after August 12, 1981. The failure of\nthe Division of Taxation to send either notice within the appropriate times\nprovided herein discharges the purchaser from liability. However, the seller is\nnot discharged from his liability. Example 6:Assume the same facts as in Example 5, except\nthat, although the postmark on the sender's receipt for the certified\nmail--return receipt requested--is stamped August 9, 1981, the envelope or\nwrapper containing the notice is actually received by the Bulk Sales Unit on\n\nAugust 14, 1981. Since the notice was served at least 10 days prior to the date\nof sale, the notice is timely. For purposes of the 90-day notice by the\n\nDivision of Taxation, notice of the total taxes due the State or notice that no\ntaxes are due and the funds withheld may be released, the date of receipt of\nthe notice is deemed to be August 12, 1981, 10 days prior to the date of sale. However, for purposes of the notice by the Division of Taxation of possible\nclaim for taxes due the State, the date of the receipt of the notice is August\n14, 1981, the date when such notice was actually received by the Bulk Sales\n\nUnit. The Division of Taxation will mail to the purchaser a notice of possible\nclaim for taxes due the State on or before August 21, 1981, which date is five\nbusiness days subsequent to August 14, 1981. Furthermore, the Division of\n\nTaxation will mail to the purchaser a notice of the total taxes due the State\nor a notice that no taxes are due and the funds withheld may be released. Such\nnotice will be mailed by the Division of Taxation on or before November 10, 1981, which date is 90 days after August 12, 1981. The failure of the Division\nof Taxation to send either notice within the appropriate times provided herein\nwill discharge the purchaser from liability. However, the seller is not\ndischarged from his liability. Example 7:Assume the same facts as in Example 6, except\nthat the postmark is dated August 12, 1981. Since the notice is served at least\n10 days prior to the date of sale, the notice is timely. The obligations of the\n\nDivision of Taxation with respect to the mailing of the notice for possible\ntaxes due and the mailing of the notice of total taxes due are the same as in\nthe above example. Example 8:Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except\nthat a warrant for unpaid sales taxes had been docketed as a judgment against\nthe seller on July 22, 1980, that is, more than 10 days prior to the date of\nsale. The Division of Taxation will mail to the purchaser a notice of possible\nclaim for taxes due, despite the fact that the purchaser has notice of record\nof a possible claim for taxes due by virtue of the docketed warrant against the\nseller. The Division of Taxation will attempt to mail the notice of possible\nclaim as expeditiously as possible. The Division of Taxation will also mail to\nthe purchaser a notice of the total taxes due the State or a notice that no\ntaxes are due and the funds withheld may be released. Such notice will be\nmailed on or before November 10, 1981, which date is 90 days after August 12, 1981. Example 9:Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except\nthat no return receipt was requested. Since no return receipt was requested, the date of service is the date when the notice was received by the Bulk Sales\n\nUnit, that is, on August 14, 1981 rather than the date stamped on the envelope\nor wrapper. The notice is therefore untimely since service was not made at\nleast 10 days prior to August 22, 1981, the date of sale. The Division of\n\nTaxation will mail to the purchaser a notice of possible claim for taxes due\nthe State and will attempt to mail such notice as expeditiously as possible. Furthermore, the Division of Taxation will mail to the purchaser a notice of\nthe total taxes due the State or a notice that no taxes are due and the funds\nwithheld may be released. Such notice will be mailed by the Division of\n\nTaxation on or before November 12, 1981, 90 days after August 14, 1981. The\nfailure of the Division of Taxation to send such notice by November 12, 1981\ndischarges the purchaser from liability. However, the seller is not discharged\nfrom his liability. Notes\nN.Y.
