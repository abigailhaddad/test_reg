  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1025.27 - Hazardous materials table\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Users of this table are urged to first read the provisions of sections\n1025.1\nthrough\n1025.26\nof this Title, so that\nthey may familiarize themselves with terms and abbreviations used throughout\nthe table, as well as with certain general provisions pertaining to quantity\nand loading restrictions (particularly for acids), and to cargo inspection\nrequirements. (b) Column 1 contains\nthe four symbols as appropriate: Plus (+) and the letters \"A,\" \"W\" and \"E.\"\n(1)\n\nThe plus (+) fixes the proper shipping\nname and the hazard class for that entry, without regard to whether the\nmaterial (including its mixtures and solutions) meets the definition of that\nclass. An alternate proper shipping name and hazard class may be authorized by\nthe Associate Director, Office of Hazardous Materials Regulation, MTB\n(U.S.D.O.T.). (2)\nA letter \"A\"\nrestricts the application of this Subchapter to materials being transported by\naircraft, but a letter \"A\" has no significance or effect when the material is a\nhazardous waste. (3)\nA letter \"W\"\nrestricts the application of this to materials being transported by vessel, but\na letter \"W\" has no significance or effect when: (i) a letter \"E\" also appears with it and the\nmaterial is a hazardous substance; or\n(ii)\nthe material is a hazardous\nwaste. (4)\nA letter \"E\"\nidentifies materials which are subject to the requirements regarding the mode\nof transportation or hazard class, if it is a hazardous substance. A hazardous\nsubstance which does not meet the defining criteria for another hazard class\nremains subject to certain requirements as an ORM-E. (c) Column 2 lists the proper shipping name\nof materials designated as hazardous materials. (1)\n\nShipping names may be used in the\nsingular or plural, and in either capital or lower case letters. (2)\n\nThe abbreviation \"n.o.i.,\" which means\n\"not otherwise indexed,\" or \"n.o.i.b.n.,\" which means \"not otherwise indexed by\nname,\" may be used interchangeably with \"n.o.s.\"\n(3)\n\nExcept for hazardous wastes, when\nqualifying words are used as part of the proper shipping name, their sequence\non the package markings and shipping paper descriptions is optional. However, the entry in the table reflects the preferred sequence. (4)\n\nExcept for organic peroxides, when one\nentry references another entry by use of the word\n\nSee, if both\nnames are in roman type, either name may be used as the proper shipping name\n(e.g.: Carbolic acid. See Phenol). For an organic peroxide, the technical name shall be used as the proper shipping name. (5)\n\nThe word\npoison\nor\npoisonous\nin this column refers to materials that would cause\ndeath by systemic poisoning rather than by corrosive destruction of\ntissue. (6)\n\nWhen a shipping name\nincludes a concentration range as part of the shipping description, the actual\nconcentration being shipped, if it is within the range stated, may be used in\nplace of the concentration range. For example, a hydrogen peroxide solution\ncontaining 30 percent peroxide may be shipped as either \"Hydrogen peroxide\nsolution (8% to 40% peroxide)\" or \"Hydrogen peroxide solution, 30%\nperoxide.\"\n(7)\n\nThe use of the\nprefix\nmono\nis optional in any shipping name when appropriate. Thus, Monoethanolamine\nmay be used interchangeably with\n\nEthanolamine. In\n\nDifluoromonochloroethane, the term\nmono\nis considered to be a prefix to the term\nchloroethane\nand may be deleted. (8)\n\nThe numbers in italics following a proper\nshipping name of a material identified by the letter \"E\" in column 1 specify, in pounds and kilograms, the minimum quantity of the material that constitutes\na reportable quantity. For example: Sodium arsenate\n(RQ-1000/454)\nmeans that the reportable quantity is 1,000 pounds or\n454 kilograms. (9)\n\nIf not included\nin a proper shipping name in the table, the proper shipping name for a\nhazardous material that is a hazardous waste must include the word\nwaste\npreceding the name of the material. For example: Waste\nacetone. (10)\nA mixture or solution\ncomprised of a hazardous material, identified in the table by technical name, and a nonhazardous material may be described using the proper shipping name of\nthe hazardous material, if: (i) the mixture or\nsolution is not specifically identified in the table; (ii)\nthe hazard class of the mixture or\nsolution is the same as that of the hazardous material; and\n(iii)\nthe qualifying word\nmixture\nor\nsolution, as appropriate, is added\nas part of the proper shipping name. For example, a solution of acetone, mineral oil and water, meeting the definition of a flammable liquid, may be\ndescribed under this optional provision as \"Acetone solution, Flammable liquid, UN1090.\"\n(11)\n\nIf the\nproper shipping name for a mixture or solution that is a hazardous substance\ndoes not include the name of the hazardous substance or substances, each\nhazardous substance must be identified in association with the basic\ndescription. (12)\n\nExcept for proper\nshipping names in the tables that are preceded by a plus (+): (i) If it is specifically determined that a\nmaterial meets the definition of a hazard class other than the class shown in\nassociation with the proper shipping name, the material must be described by an\nappropriate shipping name listed in association with the correct class for the\nmaterial. (ii)\n\nIf an appropriate\ntechnical name is not shown in the table, selection of a proper shipping name\nmust be made from the general descriptions or n.o.s. entries corresponding to\nthe specific hazard class of the material being shipped. The name that most\nappropriately describes the material must be used, e.g., an\nalcohol not listed by name in the table must be shipped as \"Alcohol, n.o.s.\"\nrather than \"Flammable liquid, n.o.s.\" Some mixtures may be more appropriately\ndescribed according to their application, such as \"Compound, cleaning, liquid\"\nor 'Compound, rust removing,\" rather than by an n.o.s. entry such as \"Corrosive\nliquid, n.o.s.\"\n(iii)\n\nIf it is\nspecifically determined that a material is not forbidden material and does not\nmeet the definition of any hazard class, the material is not a hazardous\nmaterial. (d) Column 3 contains a designation of the hazard class corresponding to each\nproper shipping name, or the word\n\nForbidden. A material for\nwhich the entry in this column if \"Forbidden\" is prohibited from being offered\nor accepted for transportation. This prohibition does not apply if these\nmaterials are diluted, stabilized, or incorporated in devices and they are\nclassed in accordance with the definition of hazardous materials contained in\npart 173 of the\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, title\n49. (e) Column 4 lists the\nidentification numbers assigned to hazardous materials. Those preceded by a\n\"UN\" are associated with descriptions considered appropriate for international\nshipments as well as domestic shipments. Those preceded by an \"NA\" are\nassociated with descriptions that are not recognized for international\nshipments, except to and from Canada. If an identification number is in the\n\"NA9000\" series, it is either associated with the description of a material\nthat is not appropriately covered by international hazardous material\n(dangerous goods) shipping standards or not appropriately addressed by such\nstandards for emergency response information purposes, except for\ntransportation between the United States and Canada. (f) Column 5 contains the applicable\nrestrictions, by paragraph, for the transportation of hazardous materials\nthrough the Queens Midtown Tunnel, the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, and the lower\nlevel of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.

No\nrestriction exists, however, for empty tank vehicles which last contained such\naqua ammonia or ammonium hydroxide, provided the tank vehicle is shown on the\nshipping paper to be empty-that is, drained of the material it last contained, with residue not in excess of 50 gallons. Footnote: A tank vehicle used for the\ntransportation of Liquid Oxygen is not allowed passage. An empty tank vehicle\nwhich last contained Liquid Oxygen is, however, allowed passage, provided the\nvehicle is shown on the shipping papers to be empty-that is, with residue not\nin excess of 50 gallons.
