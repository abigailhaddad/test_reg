  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 483.5 - Required records for Thruway mileage\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 507, 501(6)\n(a) All mileage traveled on the New York\n\nState Thruway, for which the Thruway charges a toll, is exempt from the truck\nmileage tax but not the fuel use tax. (b) Users of the Thruway will receive\nreceipts for toll charges which are paid for in cash and a monthly invoice for\ntolls which are charged. Both cash receipts and monthly invoices must be\nretained by the carrier for audit by the Tax Commission. (c) The carrier must indicate on the reverse\nof the cash receipt both the vehicular permit number and the carrier's trip or\nmanifest number. Where a receipt is issued for a tractor-trailer or other\ncombination of motor vehicles, the permit number of each vehicle must be\nindicated on the receipt. In the case of a charge account, the vehicular permit\nnumbers and the trip or manifest number shall be entered on the detailed\nlisting of trips (form TA 5504) which is received with the monthly\ninvoice. (d) Toll receipts must be\nattached by the carrier to the particular manifest or trip record to which they\napply, or otherwise shall be maintained so that on audit a receipt can be\nreadily identified with the exempt Thruway mileage it represents. (e) Every carrier must maintain the same\naccurate daily record of Thruway mileage as it does for all other mileage\ntraveled within the State (see section\n483.4\nof this\n\nPart). Exempt Thruway mileage shall not be reported on the truck mileage tax\nreturn. (f) See Part 2402 of this\n\nTitle for taxpayer record retention formats. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n483.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
