  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 182.30 - Restricted parkway\n\nState Regulations\nA parkway, or portion thereof, under construction or\nreconstruction may be designated by the Commissioner of Transportation as a\nrestricted parkway. The following regulations shall be effective with respect\nto a specific restricted parkway from the date the parkway is designated a\nrestricted parkway by an official designation of the commissioner until the\nrestriction is removed by a notice of cancellation of such designation: (a) Signs, signals and traffic control\ndevices. Operators of vehicles on restricted parkways shall obey the\ninstruction of all signs, signals and traffic control devices erected on or\nalong such parkways by the Commissioner of Transportation or his duly\ndesignated agent. (b) Speed\nrestrictions. (1)\n\nNo person shall drive a\nmotor vehicle on a restricted parkway at a speed that is greater than the speed\nlimit indicated on official signs or that is reasonable and prudent under the\nconditions and having regard to the actual and potential hazards then\nexisting. (2)\n\nExcept when a special\nhazard exists that requires lower speed for compliance with paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, no person shall drive a vehicle on a restricted parkway\nwithin a work zone at a speed in excess of 25 miles per hour. A work zone is\ndefined as a portion of the restricted parkway delineated as an area of work by\nappropriate signs. (c) Flagman. Operators of vehicles on restricted parkways shall obey the\ninstructions and/or follow the directions of any flagman or other authorized\nrepresentative of the project contractor with respect to parking, standing, stopping, backing, or other movements of such vehicle. (d) Control of persons and equipment. Construction personnel and equipment engaged in work on a restricted parkway\nshall be afforded the widest latitude in operating within the restricted\nparkway consistent with the safety of the traveling public. This shall include, but not be limited to, the crossing of the highway and the mall; the shutting\noff of lanes of travel consistent with the contract and the orders of the\n\nCommissioner of Transportation or his duly designated agent; the loading, unloading and manipulation of materials; the movement and direction of vehicles\nand equipment; and other similar operations necessary to the reasonable and\npractical performance of the contract operations. (e) Pedestrians, equestrians and animals. The\nuse of any restricted parkway by pedestrians, equestrians or animals may be\nprohibited or limited by the erection of signs by the Commissioner of\n\nTransportation or his duly designated agent, on or along the restricted\nparkway. (f) Other requirements. The provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law relating to motor vehicles shall\nnot apply to special purpose construction equipment, such as described in\nsection\n401, subdivision 7, paragraph (f) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, while engaged in\nwork on a restricted parkway, except that all such vehicles and equipment shall\nbe kept in a safe mechanical operating condition at all times and reasonable\ncaution shall be used to protect the traveling public. However, such provisions\nshall apply to those vehicles that normally operate on public highways to\ntransport persons and/or materials and are normally considered commercial\nvehicles. (g) Emergency or unusual\nconditions. The Commissioner of Transportation may, by the erection of signs, signals or other traffic control devices, alter or modify the provisions of the\nregulations in this section to adequately protect the public at locations where\nemergency or unusual conditions occur or exist as a result of the construction\nor reconstruction of the restricted parkway. These alterations or modifications\nshall have the same force and effect as those that were specifically spelled\nout in the regulations of this section and shall remain in force until the\ncondition is reasonable and safe, and the erected signs, signals or other\ntraffic control devices have been removed.
