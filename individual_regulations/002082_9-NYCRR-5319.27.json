  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.27 - Voucher validation\n\nState Regulations\n\nPayment by voucher printer as a method of credit\nredemption is permissible only when: (a) the gaming device is linked to a\ncomputerized voucher validation system that allows validation of the printed\nvoucher. Validation approval or information shall come from the voucher\nvalidation system in order to validate vouchers. Vouchers may be validated at\nany location within the gaming facility, so long as such validation meets the\nstandards in this section. Provisions shall be made if communication is lost\nand validation information cannot be sent to the validation system, thereby\nrequiring the manufacturer to have an alternate method of payment. A validation\nsystem shall be able to identify duplicate vouchers to prevent fraud by\nreprinting and redeeming a voucher that was previously issued by the gaming\ndevice; or\n(b) an alternative\nmethod approved by the commission is used that includes the ability to identify\nduplicate vouchers to prevent fraud by reprinting and redeeming a voucher that\nwas previously issued by the gaming device. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5319.27\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
