The initial individual evaluation shall be completed within 60 days\nof receipt of consent unless extended by mutual agreement of the student's\nparents and the CSE pursuant to subparagraph (7)(i) and paragraph (j)(1) of\nthis subdivision. The individual evaluation shall include a variety of\nassessment tools and strategies, including information provided by the parent, to gather relevant functional, developmental and academic information about the\nstudent that may assist in determining whether the student is a student with a\ndisability and the content of the student's individualized education program, including information related to enabling the student to participate and\nprogress in the general education curriculum (or for a preschool child, to\nparticipate in appropriate activities). The individual evaluation must be at no\ncost to the parent, and the initial evaluation must include at least: (i) a physical examination in accordance with\nthe provisions of sections\n903, 904\nand\n905\nof the\n\nEducation Law; (ii)\nan individual\npsychological evaluation, except when a school psychologist determines after an\nassessment of a school-age student, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, that further evaluation is unnecessary; (iii)\nprior to releasing any personally\nidentifiable information as described in subdivision (e) of this section, in\naccordance with sections\n200.2\n(b)(6)\nand\n200.4\n(h) and (i)\nof this Part; (iv)\nan observation\nof the student in the student's learning environment (including the regular\nclassroom setting) or, in the case of a student of less than school-age or out\nof school, an environment appropriate for a student of that age, to document\nthe student's academic performance and behavior in the areas of difficulty; and\n(v) other appropriate\nassessments or evaluations, including a functional behavioral assessment for a\nstudent whose behavior impedes his or her learning or that of others, as\nnecessary to ascertain the physical, mental, behavioral and emotional factors\nwhich contribute to the suspected disabilities. (2)\nA determination by a school psychologist\nof the need to administer an individual psychological evaluation to a student\nof school-age pursuant to Education Law, section 4402(1)(b)(3)(a) and section\n200.1\n(aa) and (bb)\nof this Part, shall be based upon an assessment conducted by the school\npsychologist to substantiate his or her determination. Whenever a school\npsychologist determines that a psychological evaluation is unnecessary, as a\ncomponent of the initial evaluation, the psychologist shall prepare a written\nreport of such assessment, including a statement of the reasons such evaluation\nis unnecessary, which shall be reviewed by the committee. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding any provisions of this\nsubdivision or section\n200.1\n(aa)\nof this\n\nPart to the contrary, the committee on special education may direct that\nadditional evaluations or assessments be conducted in order to appropriately\nassess the student in all areas related to the suspected\ndisabilities. (4)\nA committee on\nspecial education shall arrange for an appropriate reevaluation of each student\nwith a disability if the school district determines that the educational or\nrelated services needs, including improved academic achievement and functional\nperformance of the student, warrant a reevaluation or if the student's parent\nor teacher requests a reevaluation, but not more frequently than once a year\nunless the parent and representative of the school district appointed to the\ncommittee on special education agree otherwise; and at least once every three\nyears, except where the school district and the parent agree in writing that\nsuch reevaluation is unnecessary. The reevaluation shall be conducted by a\nmultidisciplinary team or group of persons, including at least one teacher or\nother specialist with knowledge in the area of the student's disability. In\naccordance with paragraph (5) of this subdivision, the reevaluation shall be\nsufficient to determine the student's individual needs, educational progress\nand achievement, the student's ability to participate in instructional programs\nin regular education and the student's continuing eligibility for special\neducation. The results of any reevaluations must be addressed by the committee\non special education in a meeting to review and, as appropriate, revise the\nstudent's IEP. To the extent possible, the school district shall encourage the\nconsolidation of reevaluation meetings for the student and other committee on\nspecial education meetings for the student. (5)\n\nDetermination of needed evaluation data. (i) As a part of an initial evaluation, if\nappropriate, and as part of any reevaluation in accordance with section\n200.4\n(b)(4)\nof\nthis Part, a group that includes the committee on special education, and other\nqualified professionals, as appropriate, shall review existing evaluation data\non the student, including evaluations and information provided by the parents\nof the student, current classroom-based assessments, local or State\nassessments, classroom-based observations, and observations by teachers and\nrelated services providers.

If the board continues to disagree\nwith the recommendation of the committee or subcommittee, the board may\ncontinue to remand the recommendation to the original committee or subcommittee\nfor additional reviews of its objections or concerns, or establish a second\ncommittee or subcommittee to develop a new recommendation in accordance with\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, provided that the board arranges for the\nprograms and services in accordance with the student's IEP within 60 school\ndays of receipt of consent to evaluate for a student not previously identified\nas having a disability, or within 60 school days of the referral for review of\nthe student with a disability; or\n(ii)\nthe board may establish a second\ncommittee on special education or subcommittee to develop a new recommendation\nfor the student at a meeting held in accordance with the procedures prescribed\nin this Part. If the board disagrees with such new recommendation, the board\nmay remand the recommendation to such second committee or subcommittee with a\nstatement of the board's objections or concerns and a request that a timely\nmeeting be held to review and consider such objections or concerns. Such second\ncommittee or subcommittee shall consider the board's objections or concerns, revise the IEP where appropriate, and resubmit a recommendation to the board. If the board continues to disagree with the recommendation of such second\ncommittee or subcommittee, the board may continue to remand the recommendation\nfor additional reviews of its objections or concerns by such second committee\nor subcommittee, provided that the board arranges for the programs and services\nin accordance with the student's IEP, as developed by such second committee or\nsubcommittee, within 60 school days of receipt of consent to evaluate for a\nstudent not previously identified as having a disability, or within 60 school\ndays of the referral for review of the student with a disability. Nothing in\nthis paragraph shall be construed to authorize the board to select the\nrecommendation of the original committee or subcommittee once it has\nestablished a second committee or subcommittee to make a new recommendation for\nthe student pursuant to this subparagraph.

The individual\nevaluation shall be completed within 60 days of receipt of consent, unless\nextended by mutual written agreement of the student's parent and the CSE. (i) The individual evaluation must include\ninformation from an observation of the student in routine classroom instruction\nand monitoring of the student's performance that was either done before the\nstudent was referred for an evaluation or from an observation of the student's\nacademic performance in the regular classroom after the student has been\nreferred for an evaluation and parental consent, consistent with section\n200.5\n(b) of this\n\nPart, is obtained. Such observation shall be conducted by an individual\nspecified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nTo ensure that underachievement in a\nstudent suspected of having a learning disability is not due to lack of\nappropriate instruction in reading or mathematics, the CSE must, as part of the\nevaluation procedures pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, consider: (a) data that demonstrate that\nprior to, or as part of, the referral process, the student was provided\nappropriate instruction in regular education settings, delivered by qualified\npersonnel; and\n(b) data-based\ndocumentation of repeated assessments of achievement at reasonable intervals, reflecting formal assessment of student progress during instruction, which was\nprovided to the student's parents. (2)\n\nThe determination of eligibility for\nspecial education for a student suspected of having a learning disability must\nbe made by the CSE, which shall include the student's regular education teacher\nas defined in section\n200.1\n(pp)\nof this\n\nPart and at least one person qualified to conduct individual diagnostic\nexaminations of students (such as a school psychologist, teacher of speech and\nlanguage disabilities, speech/language pathologist or reading\nteacher). (3)\nA student may be\ndetermined to have a learning disability if, when provided with learning\nexperiences and instruction appropriate for the student's age or State-approved\ngrade-level standards, the student does not achieve adequately for the\nstudent's age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of\nthe following areas: oral expression, listening comprehension, written\nexpression, basic reading skills, reading fluency skills, reading\ncomprehension, mathematics calculation, mathematics problem solving; and\n(i) The student either: (a) does not make sufficient progress to meet\nage or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the areas\nidentified in this paragraph when using a process based on the student's\nresponse to scientific, research-based intervention pursuant to section\n100.2\n(ii)\nof this\n\nTitle; or\n(b) exhibits a pattern of\nstrengths and weaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to age, State-approved grade-level standards, or intellectual development that is\ndetermined by the CSE to be relevant to the identification of a learning\ndisability, using appropriate assessments consistent with subdivision (b) of\nthis section; and\n(ii)\n\nThe CSE determines that its findings under this paragraph are not primarily the\nresult of a visual, hearing, or motor disability; an intellectual disability; emotional disability; cultural factors; environmental or economic disadvantage; or limited English proficiency. (4)\n\nIn addition to the criteria in paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision, the CSE is not prohibited from considering whether\nthere is a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability in\noral expression, listening comprehension, written expression, basic reading\nskill, reading fluency skills, reading comprehension, mathematical calculation\nand/or mathematical problem solving; provided that effective on and after July\n1, 2012, a school district shall not use the severe discrepancy criteria to\ndetermine that a student in kindergarten through grade four has a learning\ndisability in the area of reading. (5)\n\nSpecific documentation for the\neligibility determination. (i) When\ndetermining eligibility for a student suspected of having a learning\ndisability, the CSE shall prepare a written report containing a statement of: (a) whether the student has a learning\ndisability; (b) the basis for\nmaking the determination, including an assurance that the determination has\nbeen made in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section; (c) the relevant behavior, if any, noted\nduring the observation of the student and the relationship of that behavior to\nthe student's academic functioning; (d) the educationally relevant medical\nfindings, if any; (e) whether, consistent with paragraph (3) of this subdivision: (1)\nthe student does not achieve adequately\nfor the student's age or to meet State-approved grade-level standards; and\n(2)\nthe student; (i) does not make sufficient progress to meet\nage or State-approved grade-level standards; or\n(ii)\nexhibits a pattern of strengths and\nweaknesses in performance, achievement, or both, relative to age, State-approved grade-level standards or intellectual development; (f) the determination\nof the CSE concerning the effects of a visual, hearing, or motor disability; an\nintellectual disability; emotional disability; cultural factors; environmental\nor economic disadvantage; or limited English proficiency on the student's\nachievement level; and\n(g) if the\nstudent has participated in a process that assesses the student's response to\nscientific, research-based intervention pursuant to section\n100.2\n(ii)\nof this\n\nTitle: (1)\nthe instructional strategies used\nand the student-centered data collected; and\n(2)\nthe documentation that the student's\nparents were notified in accordance with section\n100.2\n(ii)(1)(vi)\nof this Title. (ii)\n\nEach CSE member must certify in writing\nwhether the report reflects the member's conclusion. If it does not reflect the\nmember's conclusion, the CSE member must submit a separate statement presenting\nthe member's conclusions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
