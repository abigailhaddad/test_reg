  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 480.1 - Declaration of policy\n\nState Regulations\n\nComprehensive environmental regulatory management programs\nare essential to protect New York's environmental resources and the public's\nhealth and welfare. Those regulated entities who use and impact on the State's\nenvironmental resources should bear the costs of the regulatory provisions\nwhich permit the use of these resources in a manner consistent with the\nenvironmental, economic and social needs of the State. Regulatory fees are an\nappropriate mechanism to pay a portion of the costs of the department's\nregulatory functions and programs and a portion of the costs to fund the\ncleanup of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites. Such fees should be borne\nby the State's regulated entities in order to further strengthen the State's\ncapabilities to achieve its environmental quality objectives. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n480.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
