A request for a report under\nthis Part may require such information and the answers to such questions as may\nbe reasonably pertinent to the subject of the action or determination under\nconsideration. (b) Waste loading. In\ncases involving objections to an allocation of the assimilative capacity of a\nstream, waste load allocation for a point source, or load allocation for a new\npoint source, the report shall be signed and verified by a technically\nqualified person having personal knowledge of the facts stated therein, and\nshall include such of the following items as the executive director may\nrequire: (1)\na specification with\nparticularity of the ground or grounds for the objection; and failure to\nspecify a ground for objection prior to the hearing shall foreclose the\nobjector from thereafter asserting such a ground at the hearing; (2)\na description of industrial processing\nand waste treatment operational characteristics and outfall configuration in\nsuch detail as to permit an evaluation of the character, kind and quantity of\nthe discharges, both treated and untreated, including the physical, chemical\nand biological properties of any liquid, gaseous, solid, radioactive, or other\nsubstance composing the discharge in whole or in part; (3)\nthe thermal characteristics of the\ndischarges and the level of heat in flow; (4)\ninformation in sufficient detail to\npermit evaluation in depth of any in-plant control or recovery process for\nwhich credit is claimed; (5)\nthe\nchemical and toxicological characteristics including the processes and/or\nindirect discharges which may be the source of the chemicals or\ntoxicity; (6)\nan analysis of all\nthe parameters that may have an effect on the strength of the waste or impinge\nupon the water quality criteria set forth in the basin regulations, including a\ndetermination of the rate of biochemical oxygen demand and the projection of a\nfirst-stage carbonaceous oxygen demand; (7)\nmeasurements of the waste as closely as\npossible to the processes where the wastes are produced, with the sample\ncomposited either continually or at frequent intervals (one-half hour or, where\npermitted by the executive director, one-hour periods), so as to represent\nadequately the strength and volume of waste that is discharged; and\n(8)\nsuch other and additional specific\ntechnical data as the executive director may reasonably consider necessary and\nuseful for the proper determination of a waste load allocation.
