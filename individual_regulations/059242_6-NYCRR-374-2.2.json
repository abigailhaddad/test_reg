  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 374-2.2 - Applicability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. This subdivision identifies those materials which are\nsubject to regulation as used oil under this Subpart. This subdivision also\nidentifies some materials that are not subject to regulation as used oil under\nthis Subpart, and indicates whether these materials may be subject to\nregulation as hazardous waste under Part 370 through Subparts 374-1, 374-3, and\n\nPart 376 of this Title. (1)\n\nUsed oil. The department presumes that used oil is to be recycled or burned for energy\nrecovery unless a used oil handler disposes of used oil, or sends used oil for\ndisposal. Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, the\nregulations of this Subpart apply to used oil and to materials identified in\nthis subdivision as being subject to regulation as used oil, whether or not the\nused oil or material exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste identified\nin section\n371.3\nof this Title. Used oil\nsubject to regulation under this Subpart is a solid waste as defined under\nsection\n360.2\nof this Title. (2)\n\nMixtures of used oil and hazardous waste. (i) Listed hazardous waste. (a) Mixtures of hazardous waste, listed in\nsection\n371.4\nof this Title, and of used\noil are subject to regulation as hazardous waste under Part 370 through\n\nSubparts 374-1, 374-3, and Part 376 of this Title, rather than as used oil\nunder this Subpart. (b) Rebuttable\npresumption for used oil. Used oil containing more than 1,000 ppm total\nhalogens is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with\nhalogenated hazardous waste listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title. Persons may\nrebut this presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain\nhazardous waste (for example, by demonstrating that the used oil does not\ncontain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed\nin Appendix 23 of this Title). (1)\n\nLaboratory\nanalyses completed for purposes of rebuttable presumption must be performed by\na laboratory currently certified under the appropriate approval categories by\nthe New York State Department of Health's Environmental Laboratory Approval\n\nProgram (ELAP). (2)\n\nThe rebuttable\npresumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated\nparaffins, if they are processed, through a tolling arrangement, as described\nin section\n374-2.3\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart, to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply\nto metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other\nmanner, or disposed. (3)\n\nThe\nrebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are\ndestined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils\ncontaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other\nthan refrigeration units. (ii)\n\nCharacteristic hazardous waste. Mixtures\nof used oil and of hazardous waste that solely exhibits one or more of the\nhazardous waste characteristics identified in section\n371.3\nof this Title, and mixtures\nof used oil and of hazardous waste that is listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title solely because\nit exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified in\nsection\n371.3\nof this Title are subject to: (a) except as provided in clause\n(\nc\n) of this subdivision, regulation as hazardous waste under\n\nPart 370 through Subparts 374-1, 374-3, and Part 376 of this Title rather than\nas used oil under this Subpart, if the resultant mixture exhibits any\ncharacteristics of hazardous waste identified in section\n371.3\nof this Title; or\n(b) except as specified in clause\n(\nc\n) of this subdivision, regulation as used oil under this\n\nSubpart, if the resultant mixture does not exhibit any characteristics of\nhazardous waste identified under section\n371.3\nof this Title. (c) regulation as used oil under this\n\nSubpart, if the mixture is of used oil and a waste which is hazardous solely\nbecause it exhibits the characteristic of ignitability (\ne.g., ignitable-only mineral spirits), provided that the resultant mixture does not\nexhibit the characteristic of ignitability under section\n371.3\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (iii)\n\nConditionally exempt small quantity generator hazardous waste. Mixtures of used\noil and conditionally exempt small quantity generator hazardous waste regulated\nunder section\n371.1\n(f)(10)\nof\nthis Title are subject to regulation as used oil under this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nMaterials\ncontaining or otherwise contaminated with used oil. (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph, materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil\nfrom which the used oil has been properly drained or removed to the extent\npossible such that no visible signs of free-flowing oil remain in or on the\nmaterial: (a) are not used oil and thus not\nsubject to this Subpart; and\n(b) if\napplicable are subject to the hazardous waste regulations of Part 370 through\n\nSubparts 374-1, 374-3, and Part 376 of this Title. (ii)\n\nMaterials containing or otherwise\ncontaminated with used oil that are burned for energy recovery are subject to\nregulation as used oil under this Subpart. (iii)\n\nUsed oil drained or removed from\nmaterials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil is subject to\nregulation as used oil under this Subpart. (4)\n\nMixtures of used oil with products. (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph, mixtures of used oil and fuels or other fuel products are\nsubject to regulation as used oil under this Subpart. (ii)\n\nMixtures of used oil and diesel fuel\nmixed on-site by the generator of the used oil for use in the generator's own\nvehicles are not subject to this Subpart once the used oil and diesel fuel have\nbeen mixed. Prior to mixing, the used oil is subject to the requirements of\nsection\n374-2.3\nof this\n\nSubpart. (5)\n\nMaterials\nderived from used oil. (i) Materials that are\nreclaimed from used oil that are used beneficially and are not burned for\nenergy recovery or used in a manner constituting disposal\n(\ne.g., re-refined lubricants) are: (a) not used oil and thus are not subject to\nthis Subpart; and\n(b) not solid\nwastes and are thus not subject to the hazardous waste regulations of Part 370\nthrough Subparts 374-1, 374-3, and Part 376 of this Title as provided in\nsection\n371.1\n(d)(3)(ii)\n(\na\n) of this Title. (ii)\n\nMaterials produced from used oil that\nare burned for energy recovery (\ne.g., used oil fuels) are\nsubject to regulation as used oil under this Subpart and as waste oil under\n\nSubpart 225-2 of this Title. (iii)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, materials derived\nfrom used oil that are disposed of or used in a manner constituting disposal\nare: (a) not used oil and thus are not\nsubject to this Subpart; and\n(b) are solid wastes regulated under Part 360 of this Title, unless they are\nsubject to the hazardous waste regulations of Part 370 through Subpart 374-1, 374-3, and Part 376 of this Title if the materials are listed or identified as\nhazardous waste. (iv)\n\nUsed oil re-refining distillation bottoms that are used as feedstock to\nmanufacture asphalt products are not subject to this\n\nSubpart. (6)\n\nWastewater. Wastewater, the discharge of which is subject to regulation under either\nsection 402 or section 307(b) of the Federal Clean Water Act, as incorporated\nby reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle (including wastewaters at facilities which have eliminated the discharge\nof wastewater), contaminated with\nde minimis\nquantities of\nused oil are not subject to the requirements of this Subpart. For purposes of\nthis paragraph, de minimis quantities of used oils\nare defined\nas small spills, leaks, or drippings from pumps, machinery, pipes, and other\nsimilar equipment during normal operations or small amounts of oil lost to the\nwastewater treatment system during washing or draining operations. This\nexception will not apply if the used oil is discarded as a result of abnormal\nmanufacturing operations resulting in substantial leaks, spills, or other\nreleases, or to used oil recovered from wastewaters. (7)\n\nUsed oil introduced into crude oil\npipelines or a petroleum refining facility. (i) Used oil mixed with crude oil or natural\ngas liquids (\ne.g., in a production separator or crude oil\nstock tank) for insertion into a crude oil pipeline is exempt from the\nrequirements of this Subpart. The used oil is subject to the requirements of\nthis Subpart prior to the mixing of used oil with crude oil or natural gas\nliquids. (ii)\n\nMixtures of used oil\nand crude oil or natural gas liquids containing less than one percent used oil\nthat are being stored or transported to a crude oil pipeline or petroleum\nrefining facility for insertion into the refining process at a point prior to\ncrude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the requirements of\nthis Subpart. (iii)\n\nUsed oil that\nis inserted into the petroleum refining facility process before crude\ndistillation or catalytic cracking without prior mixing with crude oil is\nexempt from the requirements of this Subpart provided that the used oil\nconstitutes less than one percent of the crude oil feed to any petroleum\nrefining facility process unit at any given time. Prior to insertion into the\npetroleum refining facility process, the used oil is subject to the\nrequirements of this Subpart. (iv)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, used oil that is\nintroduced into a petroleum refining facility process after crude distillation\nor catalytic cracking is exempt from the requirements of this Subpart only if\nthe used oil meets the specifications of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Prior to insertion into the petroleum refining facility process, the used oil\nis subject to the requirements of this Subpart. (v) Used oil that is incidentally captured by\na hydrocarbon recovery system or wastewater treatment system as part of routine\nprocess operations at a petroleum refining facility and inserted into the\npetroleum refining facility process is exempt from the requirements of this\n\nSubpart. This exemption does not extend to used oil which is intentionally\nintroduced into a hydrocarbon recovery system (\ne.g., by\npouring collected used oil into the wastewater treatment system). (vi)\n\nTank bottoms from stock tanks containing\nexempt mixtures of used oil and crude oil or natural gas liquids are exempt\nfrom the requirements of this Subpart. (8)\n\nUsed oil on vessels. Used oil produced on\nvessels from normal shipboard operations is not subject to this Subpart until\nit is transported ashore. (9)\n\nUsed\noil containing PCBs. (i) Used oil containing\n50 ppm by weight, or greater, of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is a\nhazardous waste as defined in section\n371.4\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, and is not subject to the requirements of this Subpart, but is subject\nto regulation under 40 CFR part\n761, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, and to Parts 370 through 373, Subparts 374-1 and 374-3, and Part 376 of\nthis Title. (ii)\n\nUsed oil\ncontaining PCBs at any concentration less than 50 ppm is subject to the\nrequirements of this Subpart. If the PCB concentration in the used oil has been\ndiluted to less than 50 ppm, it is also regulated under 40 CFR part\n761\nas used\noil containing PCBs at 50 ppm or greater. (iii)\nPCB-containing used oil subject to the\nrequirements of this Subpart may also be subject to the prohibitions and\nrequirements found at 40 CFR part\n761, including section 761.20(d) and (e). No\nperson may avoid these provisions by diluting used oil containing PCBs, unless\notherwise specifically provided for in this Subpart or in 40 CFR part\n761. (b) Used oil specifications. (1)\n\nUsed\noil burned for energy recovery, and any fuel produced from used oil by\nprocessing, blending, or other treatment, is subject to regulation under this\n\nSubpart unless it is demonstrated not to exceed any of the allowable levels of\nthe constituents and properties shown in Table 1 of this subdivision. Once used\noil that is to be burned for energy recovery has been demonstrated not to\nexceed any allowable level and the person making that demonstration complies\nwith section\n374-2.8\n(c) and\n(d), and (e)(2) of this Subpart, the used oil\nis no longer subject to this Subpart. (i) Laboratory analyses completed for purposes of specification determination must\nbe performed by a laboratory currently certified under the appropriate approval\ncategories by the New York State Department of Health's Environmental\n\nLaboratory Approval Program (ELAP). Table 1\n\nUsed Oil Not Exceeding Any Allowable Level Shown\n\nBelow Is Not Subject to This Subpart When Burned for Energy\n\nRecovery\n1\n\nConstituent/property\n\nAllowable level\n\nArsenic\n5 ppm maximum\n\nCadmium\n2 ppm maximum\n\nChromium\n10 ppm maximum\n\nLead\n100 ppm maximum\nPCBs\n2 ppm maximum\n2\n\nFlash point\n100° F minimum\n\nTotal halogens\n4,000 ppm maximum\n3\n1\n\nThe allowable levels do not\napply to mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that continue to be regulated\nas hazardous waste (see paragraph [a][2] of this section). 2\n\nUsed oil containing 50 ppm by\nweight, or greater, of PCBs is a hazardous waste, excluding oil derived from\nsmall capacitors, as defined in section\n371.4\n(e)(3)(ii)\nof\nthis Title, as the sole PCB contamination source. Applicable standards for the\nburning of used oil containing PCBs are imposed by Part 370 through Subpart\n374-1 and Part 376 of this Title and\n40 CFR\n761.20(e), as incorporated\nby reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. 3\n\nUsed oil containing more than\n1,000 ppm total halogens is presumed to be a hazardous waste under the\nrebuttable presumption provided under subparagraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Such used oil is subject to section\n374-1.8\nof this Part rather than\nthis Subpart when burned for energy recovery, unless the presumption of mixing\ncan be successfully rebutted. (2)\n\nAll used oil, whether in transit or in\nstorage at a facility, must be considered off-specification used oil, unless\nanalysis or other information documents that the used oil is\non-specification. (c) Prohibitions. (1)\n\nSurface\nimpoundment prohibition. Used oil must not be managed in surface impoundments, waste piles, pits, ponds or lagoons. (2)\n\nUse as a dust suppressant. The use of\nused oil as a dust suppressant, for land application, or for disposal directly\non the land, is prohibited. (3)\n\nBurning in particular units. Off-specification used oil fuel may be burned for\nenergy recovery in only the following devices: (i) industrial furnaces identified in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle; (ii)\nboilers, as defined in\nsection\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, that are identified as follows: (a) industrial boilers located on the site of a facility engaged in a manufacturing\nprocess where substances are transformed into new products, including the\ncomponent parts of products, by mechanical or chemical processes; (b) utility boilers used to produce electric\npower, steam, heated or cooled air, or other gases or fluids for sale; or\n(c) used oil-fired space heaters\nprovided that the burner meets the provisions of section\n374-2.3\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart. (iii)\nhazardous\nwaste incinerators subject to regulation under sections\n373-2.15\nand\n373-3.15\nof this\n\nTitle. (4)\n\nAbsorbents. Used oil which is recyclable or reusable must not be disposed of through the\nuse of absorbent materials, other than for purposes of spill\ncleanup. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
