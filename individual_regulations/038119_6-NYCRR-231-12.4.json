  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-12.4 - Exemption and waiver from onsite ('i.e.', site specific) air quality monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndepartment may exempt a proposed new or modified facility from the requirements\nof section\n231-12.3\nof this Subpart with\nrespect to monitoring for a particular regulated NSR contaminant, if: (1)\nthe emissions increase of the regulated\nNSR contaminant from the proposed new or modified facility would cause, in any\nattainment area, air quality impacts less than the following deminimis\nmonitoring levels: Carbon Monoxide ---------------------\n575 µ/m\n3, 8-hour\naverage; Nitrogen dioxide ----------------------\n- 14 µ/m\n3, annual\naverage; Particulate matter (PM-10) -----------\n- 10 µ/m\n3, 24-hr\naverage; PM-2.5\n----------------------------------\n- 0 µ/m\n3, 24-hr. average; Sulfur dioxide -------------------------\n- 13 µ/m\n3, 24-hour\naverage; Ozone\n1\n----------------------------------\n- see footnote\n\nElemental lead ------------------------\n- - 0.1 µ/m\n3, 3-month average; Fluorides\n-------------------------------\n- - 0.25 µ/m\n3, 24-hour average; Total and reduced sulfur -------------\n- 10 µ/m\n3, 1-hour\naverage; Hydrogen sulfide ---------------------\n- - 0.2 µ/m\n3, 1-hour\naverage; or\n(2)\nthe concentrations of the regulated NSR\ncontaminant in the area that the facility would affect are less than the\nconcentrations listed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (b) In cases where the source\nimpacts are above the deminimis monitoring levels of paragraph (a)(1) of this\nsection, the department may waive the requirements of section\n231-12.3\nof this Subpart with\nrespect to monitoring for a particular regulated NSR contaminant for which an\napplicant makes an acceptable showing that: (1)\nrepresentative existing ambient air\nmonitoring data exists in the affected area and is of the quality and nature\nwhich demonstrates the current conditions of the area's air quality; or\n(2)\nrepresentative ambient air\nmonitoring data exists from a prior time period which can be demonstrated to be\nconservative ('i.e.' higher) in establishing the current conditions of the\narea's air quality. 1\n\nNo deminimis air quality\nlevel is provided for ozone. However, any net increase of 100 tons per year or\nmore of NO\nx\nor volatile organic compounds subject to\n\nSubpart 231-7 or Subpart 231-8 may be required to gather ambient air quality\ndata according to the provisions of section 231-1 2.3.
