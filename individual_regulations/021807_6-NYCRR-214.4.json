  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 214.4 - Coke pushing and transport to quench tower\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A by-product coke oven battery must be\nequipped with coke pushing and transport to quench tower control equipment to\nlimit particulate emissions to the atmosphere during pushing and transport to\nthe quench tower unless exempted under section\n214.10\n(b) of this\n\nPart. The stack discharge from this system to the outdoor atmosphere shall be\nlimited to particulate emissions of either 0.05 grains per dry standard cubic\nfoot of exhaust gas or 0.05 pounds per ton of coal charged into the oven, whichever is less stringent. Pushing emission control sheds must be limited to\na particulate emission of 0.07 lb/ton of coal charged. (b) The average opacity of emissions from\ncoke pushing and from any transport of coke to the quench tower must be less\nthan 20 percent opacity, as measured in accordance with the procedures set\nforth in subdivision (c) this section. If uncontrolled quench cars are used to\ntransport coke from a pushing control device to a quench tower, the average\nopacity of emissions from the uncontrolled car must not exceed 20 percent when\nmeasured by the method of subdivision (c) of this section. (c) Compliance with the opacity standards of\nsubdivision (b) of this section will be determined by observing and timing any\nvisible emission discharged during the pushing of coke from the oven into the\ntransport car and during the transport of coke to the quench tower. The\nobserver must stand at a distance sufficient to provide a clear view of the\npushing and transport operations with the sun oriented in the 140° sector of\nhis back. The opacity of emissions will be computed by averaging the results of\n24 consecutive opacity observations made at 15-second intervals. Observations\nmust be made only during the pushing and transport period. A sufficient number\nof consecutive pushing and transport operations must be observed to accumulate\nthe minimum of 24 consecutive opacity readings. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n214.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
