(iv)\n\nOther payment standards for leave of\nabsence reserved bed days. (a) When a\nrecipient incurs expenses, such as room and board, while on leave of absence, and the institution's per diem rate already reimburses the institution for\nthese expenses, the institution must pay the cost. The recipient's social\nservices district must give prior approval for an exception to this\nrequirement. The social services district must ensure that costs included in\nthe institution's per diem rate are reconciled with the institution's claim for\npayment of reserved bed days. (b) No payment for reserved bed days will be made if a recipient returns to the\ninstitution from a leave of absence and is then discharged within 24 hours. Prior approval by the recipient's social services district's MA professional\ndirector, or for a recipient in an RTF, by the Commissioner of the OMH or his\nor her designee, or, for recipients in ICFs/MR or specialty hospitals, by the\n\nCommissioner of the OPWDD or his or her designee, must be obtained for an\nexception to this provision.

(vi)\nA bed reservation\nunder this paragraph must be terminated when the institution is informed that\nthe recipient will not return from leave to the institution. (vii)\n\nWhen a recipient has been a patient in\nmore than one medical institution within any 12-month period, the institution\nwhere the recipient is currently a patient must determine the number of paid\nleave of absence days in other institutions. Such institution must assure that\nthe recipient's total number of leave days during the previous 12-month period\ndoes not exceed 18 days, unless prior authorization for extra days has been\nreceived or the 180-day limit is inapplicable. When a recipient is transferred\nto another inpatient institution, a copy of his or her absence register must be\nincluded in the transfer records. (8)\n\nPrior authorization for payment for\nreserved bed days. (i) Prior authorization for\npayment of reserved bed days is not required when a recipient is hospitalized\nfor 15 or fewer days and returns immediately to the institution. (ii)\n\nPrior authorization for payment of\nreserved bed days is required when: (a) a\nrecipient is hospitalized for 15 or fewer days and returns to an institution\nwhich has been identified by the social services district, the Office of Health\n\nSystems Management of the Department of Health, the OMRDD or the OMH as having\ndeviated from this subdivision's standards. The social services district must\nrequire such institution to request prior authorization for payment; or\n(b) a recipient is hospitalized\nfor 15 or fewer days and does not return from the hospital immediately\nfollowing the time for which the bed was reserved; or\n(c) a recipient, who based on available\nmedical information was expected to be hospitalized for 15 days or fewer, is\nhospitalized for more than 15 days. If prior authorization is obtained, payment\nwill be made for the recipient's reserved bed days up to 20 days per hospital\nstay, or up to 30 days per hospital stay for a recipient in an RTF who was\nhospitalized for acute psychiatric care.
