  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 242-10.2 - CO[2] emissions offset definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Anaerobic digester'. A device that\npromotes the decomposition of organic material to simple organics and gaseous\nbiogas products, in the absence of elemental oxygen, usually accomplished by\nmeans of controlling temperature and volume, and including a methane recovery\nsystem. (b) 'Anaerobic digestion'. The decomposition of organic material including manure brought about through\nthe microorganisms in the absence of elemental oxygen. (c) 'Anaerobic storage'. Storage of organic\nmaterial in an oxygen-free environment, or under oxygen-free conditions, including but not limited to, holding tanks, ponds, and lagoons. (d) 'ANSI'. American National Standards\n\nInstitute. (e) 'Biogas'. Gas\nresulting from the decomposition of organic matter under anaerobic conditions. The principle constituents are methane and carbon dioxide. (f) 'CO\n2e\n'. CO\n2\ne means carbon dioxide equivalent. (g) 'Conflict of interest'. A situation that\nmay arise with respect to an individual in relation to any specific project\nsponsor, CO\n2\nemissions offset project or category of\noffset projects, such that the individual's other activities or relationships\nwith other persons or organizations render or may render the individual\nincapable of providing an impartial certification opinion, or otherwise\ncompromise the individual's objectivity in performing certification\nfunctions. (h) 'Cooperating\nregulatory agency'. A regulatory agency in a state or United States\njurisdiction that is not a participating state that has entered into a\nmemorandum of understanding with the appropriate regulatory agencies of all\nparticipating states to carry out certain obligations relative to\nCO\n2\nemissions offset projects in that state or United\n\nStates jurisdiction, including but not limited to the obligation to perform\naudits of offset project sites, and report violations of this\n\nSubpart. (i) 'Independent verifier'. An individual that has been approved by the department or its agent to conduct\nverification activities. (j) 'Market\npenetration rate'. A measure of the diffusion of a technology, product, or\npractice in a defined market, as represented by the percentage of annual sales\nfor a product or practice, or as a percentage of the existing installed stock\nfor a product or category of products, or as the percentage of existing\ninstalled stock that utilizes a practice. The department may determine an\nappropriate market definition and market penetration metric for a category of\ntechnology, product or practice, and may issue guidance specifying the\ntechnologies, products or practices that meet a specified market penetration\nrate. (k) 'Offset project'. An\noffset project includes all equipment, materials, items, or actions directly\nrelated to the reduction of CO\n2\nequivalent emissions or\nthe sequestration of carbon specified in a consistency application submitted\npursuant to section\n242-10.4\nof this Part. Equipment, materials, items, or actions unrelated to an offset project reduction of\nCO\n2\nequivalent emissions or the sequestration of carbon, but occurring at a location where an offset project occurs, shall not be\nconsidered part of an offset project, unless specified at section\n242-10.5\nof this Subpart. (l) 'Permanently retired'. A greenhouse gas\nallowance or credit has been \"permanently retired\" if it has been placed in a\nretirement account controlled by the jurisdiction that generated the allowance\nor credit, or has been placed in an allowance retirement account controlled by\nthe department, or is otherwise determined by the department to have been\nrendered unusable. (m) 'Project\ncommencement'. For an offset project involving physical construction, other\nwork at an offset project site, or installation of equipment or materials, the\ndate of the beginning of such activity. For an offset project that involves the\nimplementation of a management activity or protocol, the date on which such\nactivity is first implemented or such protocol first utilized. (n) 'Regional-type anaerobic digester'. An\nanaerobic digester using feedstock from more than one agricultural operation, or importing feedstock from more than one agricultural operation. Also commonly\nreferred to as a \"community digester\" or \"centralized digester.\"\n(o) 'Renewable portfolio standard'. A\nstatutory or regulatory requirement that a load-serving entity provide a\ncertain portion of the electricity it supplies to its customers from renewable\nenergy sources, or any other statutory or regulatory requirement that a certain\nportion of electricity supplied to the electricity grid be generated from\nrenewable energy sources. (p) 'System benefit fund'. Any fund collected directly from retail electricity or\nnatural gas ratepayers. (q) 'Total\nsolids'. Total solids are the total of all solids in a sample. They include the\ntotal suspended solids, total dissolved solids, and volatile suspended\nsolids. (r) 'Transmission and/or\ndistribution entity'. The assets and equipment used to transmit and distribute\nelectricity from an electric generator to the electrical load of a customer. Includes all related assets and equipment located within the service territory\nof the entity, defined as the service territory of a load-serving entity\nspecified by the applicable state department. (s) 'Verification'. The determination by an\nindependent verifier that certain parts of a CO\n2\nemissions offset project consistency application and/or measurement, monitoring\nor verification report conform to the requirements of this Subpart. (t) 'Volatile solids'. The fraction of total\nsolids that is comprised primarily of organic matter as defined in U.S. EPA\nMethod Number 160.4, Methods for the Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes\n(MCAWW) (EPA/600/4-79/020)(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this\n\nTitle).
