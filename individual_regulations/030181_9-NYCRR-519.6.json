  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 519.6 - Appeals para 7, part v, mcm\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nOnly one appeal is permissible\nunder section\n130.15\nproceedings. There is no appeal from the imposition of the\nproceedings. The appeal is from the punishment. An appeal not made within a\nreasonable time may be rejected as untimely by the senior authority. A\nreasonable time will vary according to the situation; however, an appeal\n(including all documentary matters) submitted more than 30 days after the\npunishment is imposed will be presumed to be untimely, unless the superior\nauthority, in his or her sound discretion for good cause shown, determines it\nto be timely. (2)\n\nIf, at the time\nof imposition of punishment, the member indicates a desire not to appeal, the\nsuperior authority may reject a subsequent election to appeal, even though it\nis made within the 30-day period. Although a suspended punishment may be\nappealed, no appeal is authorized from the vacation of a suspended\npunishment. (3)\n\nWhen the member\ndesires to appeal, the imposing commander, or his or her successor-in-command, will make available to the member reasonable assistance (to include judge\nadvocate counseling, if available) in preparing the appeal and will promptly\nforward the appeal to the appropriate senior authority. (b) Who may act on appeal. (1)\n\nThe authority next senior to the\ncommanding officer will act on an appeal if the member punished is still of the\ncommand of that officer at the time of appeal. If, at the time of appeal, the\nmember is no longer of the imposing commander's command, the authority next\nsenior to the member's present commanding officer (who can impose the same kind\nand amount of punishment as that imposed or resulting from subsequent\nmodifications) will act upon the appeal. (2)\n\nThe authority \"next senior\" to an\nimposing commander is normally the next senior in the chain of command, or such\nother authority as may be designated by competent authority as being next\nsenior for the purposes of section\n130.15\nproceedings. A senior authority who\nexercises GCM jurisdiction, or is a general officer in command, may delegate\nthose powers he or she has as senior authority to a commissioned officer in his\nor her command. (c) Procedure for submitting an appeal. All appeals will be made on DMNA form 1057\nand then forwarded to the imposing commander or successor-in-command; or, when\napplicable, to the senior authority. The senior authority will act on the\nappeal unless otherwise directed by competent authority. The member is not\nrequired to state reasons for his or her appeal, however, the member may do so. For example, the person may state the following in the appeal: (1)\nbased upon the evidence he or she does\nnot believe he or she is guilty; (2)\nthe punishment imposed is excessive, or\nthat a certain punishment should be mitigated or suspended. (d) Action by the imposing\ncommander or the successor-in-command. The imposing commander or his or her\nsuccessor-in-command may take any action on the appeal with respect to the\npunishment that the senior authority could have taken (para 6, part V, N.Y. MCM\nand subdivision [e] of this section). If he or she suspends, mitigates, remits\nor sets aside any part of the punishment, this action will be recorded\naccording to notes 8 and 9, DMNA form 1057 (Appendix L-2[A16]). The appellant\nwill be advised and asked to state whether, in view of this action, he or she\nwishes to withdraw the appeal. Unless the appeal is voluntarily withdrawn, the\nappeal will be forwarded to the appropriate superior authority. An officer\nforwarding the appeal may attach any matter in rebuttal of assertions made by\nthe member. (e) Action by the\nsenior authority. Action by the senior authority on appeal will be entered in\nitem 5, DMNA form 1057 (Appendix L-2[A16]). A senior authority will act on the\nappeal expeditiously. A senior authority may conduct an independent inquiry\ninto the case, if necessary or desirable. The senior authority must refer an\nappeal from a reduction or fine to a judge advocate (JA) for consideration and\nadvice before taking action; he or she may refer an appeal in any case. In\nacting on an appeal, the senior authority may exercise the same powers with\nrespect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised by the imposing commander\nor his or her successor-in-command. A timely appeal does not terminate merely\nbecause a service member is discharged from the service. It will be processed\nto completion by the senior authority. (f) Action by a judge advocate. (1)\n\nWhen an appeal is referred to a JA, the\nsenior authority will be advised either orally or in writing of the JA's\nopinion on: (i) the appropriateness of the\npunishment; (ii)\nwhether the\nproceedings were conducted in accordance with law and regulations. (2)\n\nIf the advice is given orally, that fact and the name of the JA who rendered the advice will be recorded in\nitem 7, DMNA form 1057 (Appendix L-2 [A16]). (3)\n\nThe JA is not limited to an examination\nof written matters of the record of proceedings and may make any inquiries that\nare necessary. (g) Action by senior authority regardless of appeal. Any senior authority may\nexercise the same powers as may be exercised by the imposing commander, or his\nor her successor-in-command, whether or not an appeal has been made from the\npunishment (para 7[f] [1], part V, MCM). \"Any senior authority\" has the same\nmeaning as that given to the term \"authority next senior\" in paragraph (b)(2)\nof this section, except that it also includes any authority senior to that\nauthority. A service member has no right to petition for relief under this\nsubdivision and any petition so made may be summarily denied by the superior\nauthority to whom it is addressed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
