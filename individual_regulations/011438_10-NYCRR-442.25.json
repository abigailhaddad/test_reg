  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.25 - Hospital research and education costs\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1630 ]\nAll direct costs incurred in\nconducting hospital research and formal educational activities (as opposed to\nin-service education) must be recorded in Unrestricted Fund cost center\naccounts 8010-8199 (Research Expenses) or 8220-8299 (Education\n\nExpenses). (b) Grant\naccountability. [ 1631 ] When separate accounting is required by law, grant contract, or donations restricted for research and educational\nactivities, separate cost centers must be maintained. Transfers from restricted\nfunds to match the expenditures for these activities must also be segregated\ninto separate accounts in the series 5020-5199 (Research) or 5280-5300\n(Education). Thus, accountability is maintained for all restricted research and\neducational activities. (c) Overhead allocation. [ 1632 ]\n(1)\n\nNo\nallocation of indirect overhead is to be made on the books prior to cost\nreporting unless such allocation is required by grant contract. When a grant\ncontract calls for the payment of direct costs plus an overhead factor, the\noverhead factor should be included in billing, but no allocation should be made\nin the hospital's accounting records. (2)\n\nThe following example illustrates the\naccounting treatment of restricted grant activity: (i) Assume that a hospital received a\nspecific research grant on December 1, which called for payment of direct costs\nincurred, plus an overhead allocation of 10 percent of such costs. At December\n31 (the hospital's year-end), $150 of direct costs had been incurred. The\nfollowing entries would be made in the hospital's accounting records at\n\nDecember 31: (ii)\n\nUnrestricted\n\nFund. (ii)\n\nUnrestricted\n\nFund. Account\n\nDr. Cr. Research\n8010\n$150\n\nCash\n1010\n$150\n\nDue from Specific Purpose Fund\n1074\n$165\n\nTransfer from restricted funds for research\nexpenses\n5020\n$165\n\nTo record specific research direct costs and\nto set up receivable and other operating revenue from restricted fund for\ndirect costs, plus overhead allocation. (iii) Specific Purpose Fund. Fund balance-Transfers to Operating Fund for\n\nOperating Purposes\n2797\n$165\n\nDue to Operating Fund\n2781\n$165\n\nTo record liability to Unrestricted Fund for\ndirect research costs and overhead allocation. (3)\n\nIf direct overhead must, by grant\ncontract, be recorded in the Unrestricted Fund cost centers used for the\nrecording of the direct costs of the grant activity, the natural expense\nclassification.89 (other expenses) must be used. A separate cost center\nentitled \"Overhead Applied\" should be established in the Unrestricted Fund and\ncredited with the amount of such overhead allocation. For reporting purposes\nthe balance in the \"Overhead Applied\" cost center must be offset against the\ngrant activity cost center, so costs remaining in the grant activity cost\ncenter are direct costs only. (d) Affiliated school contracts. [ 1633 ] Education costs incurred relative to\naffiliated school contracts must be reflected in the Education series of\naccounts (8220-8299) in the Unrestricted Fund. Salaries, wages and stipends\npaid to students on approved programs (including interns and residents) must be\nreflected in this series of accounts. Salaries, wages and stipends paid to\ninterns and residents must be reflected in the appropriate natural\nclassification of the Postgraduate Medical Education cost centers (Approved -\naccount 8240 and Non-Approved - account 8250). Fees paid to physicians involved\nprimarily in approved education programs must also be recorded in the Education\nseries of accounts, in the appropriate cost center. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.25\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
