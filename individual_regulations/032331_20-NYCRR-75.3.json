Tit. 20 § 75.3 - Returns of cigarette use tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 171, 471-a and 475\n(a) Every person who uses cigarettes in New\n\nYork State so as to be subject to the use tax imposed pursuant to section\n471-a\nof the Tax Law and section\n74.5\nof this Title must, within 24 hours after such use, file with the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance a use tax return on a form prescribed by the department\nfor such purpose. Such return must explain in detail the circumstances of the\ntaxable use and indicate the quantity of cigarettes subject to tax. (b) (1)\nA\nreturn of cigarette use tax must be accompanied by payment of the tax shown to\nbe due thereon. Such remittance must be payable to the New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. The tax may be reported and paid in whole\ndollar amounts. If this election is made, a fractional part of a dollar may be\ndisregarded, unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in which case such\nfractional part must be increased to one dollar. However, such election is not\napplicable to items which must be taken into account in making the computations\nnecessary to determine the amount of tax required to be shown on the\nreturn. (2)\n\nFailure to pay the tax\nwhen due may subject the person liable for such payment to the civil penalties\nimposed by section\n481\nof the Tax Law (see Part 78 of this\n\nTitle) and possible criminal sanctions imposed by article 37 of such\nlaw. (c) A return of\ncigarette use tax must be prepared in accordance with the instructions provided\nby the Department of Taxation and Finance and must be signed and filed in the\nsame manner as an agent's cigarette tax return must be signed and filed\npursuant to section\n75.1\n(c) and (d)\nof this Part.
