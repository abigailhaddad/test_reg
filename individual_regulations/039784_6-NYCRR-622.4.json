  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 622.4 - Answer\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Within twenty\n(20) days of receiving the notice of hearing and complaint or an amended\ncomplaint, respondent must serve on department staff an answer signed by\nrespondent, respondent's attorney or other authorized representative. The time\nto answer may be extended by consent of department staff or by permission of\nthe ALJ. Failure to make timely service of an answer constitutes a default and\na waiver of respondent's right to a hearing. (b) Respondent must specify in the answer\neach allegation of the complaint respondent admits, each allegation respondent\ndenies, and each allegation as to which respondent lacks information sufficient\nto form a belief as to the truth or accuracy of the allegation. (c) Respondent's answer must explicitly\nassert any affirmative defenses including those listed in CPLR 3018 together\nwith a statement of the facts as may be necessary to provide notice of each\naffirmative defense asserted. Whenever the complaint alleges that respondent\nconducted an activity without a required permit, a defense based upon the\ninapplicability of the permit requirement to the activity constitutes an\naffirmative defense. Inability to pay constitutes an affirmative defense, but\nonly to department staff's request for a penalty and not as a defense to\nliability. (d) Affirmative defenses\nnot pleaded in the answer may not be raised in the hearing unless allowed by\nthe ALJ. The ALJ will only allow the defense upon the filing of a satisfactory\nexplanation as to why the defense was not pleaded in the answer and a showing\nthat the affirmative defense is likely to be meritorious. (e) Respondent may move for a more definite\nstatement of the complaint within ten (10) days of receipt of the complaint on\nthe grounds that the complaint is so vague or ambiguous that respondent cannot\nreasonably be required to frame an answer. (1)\n\nIf the motion is denied, respondent must\nanswer within ten (10) days of receipt of notice that the motion is\ndenied. (2)\n\nIf the motion is\ngranted, department staff must serve an amended complaint within fifteen (15)\ndays of receipt of notice that the motion is granted and respondent must serve\nan answer within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the amended\ncomplaint. (f) Department staff may move for a more definite statement of affirmative defenses\nwithin ten (10) days of completion of service of the answer on the grounds that\nthe affirmative defenses pleaded in the answer are vague or ambiguous and that\ndepartment staff is not thereby placed on notice of the facts or legal theory\nupon which respondent's defense is based. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n622.4\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register September 16, 2020/Volume XLII, Issue 37, eff. 9/16/2020\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
