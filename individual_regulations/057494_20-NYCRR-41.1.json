  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 41.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A telephone or\ntelegraph corporation shall include in its computation of gross earnings all\ngross operating revenues derived from intrastate transmission services and that\nportion of gross operating revenues from interstate and foreign transmission\nservices attributable to New York State. (b) If the books of the taxpayer, kept in\naccordance with regulatory requirements, reflect the amount of gross operating\nrevenues from interstate and foreign transmission services attributable to New\n\nYork State, the taxpayer must allocate such gross operating revenues to New\n\nYork State in accordance with the allocation used for regulatory purposes (see\nsection\n41.2\nof\nthis Part - Allocation by accounting). (c) If the books of the taxpayer, with\nrespect to a particular item or items of gross operating revenues from\ninterstate and foreign transmission services, do not reflect the amount of\ngross operating revenues from interstate and foreign transmission services\nattributable to New York State, then such item or items shall be allocated by\nthe allocation by formula method (see section\n41.3\nof\nthis Part - Allocation by formula). (d) The term gross earnings of telephone or\ntelegraph corporations from transmission services means gross operating\nrevenues from New York State intrastate transmission services and the portion\nof gross operating revenues from interstate and/or foreign transmission\nattributable to New York State. For example, gross operating revenues of\ntelephone corporation from transmission services include all operating\nrevenues, such as Local Service Revenues (including subscribers' station\nrevenues, public telephone revenues, service station, local private line\nservices, and other local service revenues), Toll Service Revenues (including\nmessage tolls, wide area toll services, toll private line services and other\ntoll revenues) and Miscellaneous Revenues (such as telegraph commissions, directory advertising and sales, rent revenues, revenues from general services\nand licenses and other operating revenues not provided for\nelsewhere). (e) Where the\n\nCommissioner of Taxation and Finance decides that the allocation percentage\ncomputed on the basis of the factors or methods prescribed in this Subpart does\nnot fairly and equitably reflect gross earnings of the taxpayer from all\nsources within New York State, the commissioner shall use other methods of\nallocation or apportionment which fairly and equitably reflect gross earnings\nfrom all sources within New York State. Thus, where such factors or methods\nwork hardship or do not do justice either to the taxpayer or to the State, this\nprovision authorizes the commissioner to use other methods to reflect more\naccurately business activity in New York. Also, the commissioner may, in order\nto properly reflect gross earnings, determine the taxable year or period in\nwhich any item of gross earnings shall be included without regard to the method\nof accounting employed by the taxpayer.
