  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-3.10 - Seal welding\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Seal welding of tubes. Tubes may be seal welded provided the ends of the tube\nhave sufficient wall thickness to prevent burnthrough and the requirements of\nthe appropriate sections of the ASME Code are satisfied. Seal welding of tubes\nshall be done as specified in Figure 14-3.10(1) or by other equivalent\nmethods. (b) Seal welding of\nriveted joints. Edges of butt straps or of plate laps and nozzles or\nconnections attached by riveting may be restored to original dimensions by\nwelding. Seal welding may not be used except with the special approval of the\nauthorized inspector, and in no case where cracks are present in riveted areas. Seal welding shall be done as specified in Figure 14-3.10(2) or by other\nequivalent methods. (1)\n\nCaulking edges of\nriveted joints, except longitudinal seams of unstayed cylindrical shells or\ndrums subjected to internal pressure, may be seal welded provided the seam is\nfirst mechanically caulked and made tight under hydrostatic pressure. Seal\nwelding shall not be considered a strength weld after hydrostatic\ntest. (2)\n(i) Leakage at riveted joints or tube ends\nmust be carefully investigated to determine the cause before welding is\npermitted. (ii)\n\nPrior to seal\nwelding riveted joints, the area should be examined by an appropriate method of\nnondestructive examination to assure that there are no cracks radiating from\nthe rivet holes. If necessary, the rivets should be removed to assure complete\nexamination of the area. Seal welding should not be performed if cracks are\npresent in riveted areas. (3)\n\nOn tubes, seal welding may be applied on\neither the outside or the inside. On a riveted joint, seal welding shall be\napplied on only one side. (4)\n\nCare\nshall be exercised so that the heat from seal welding will not distort the\nplates or loosen the rivets. (5)\n\nOn\ndished heads, seal welding shall not be applied to the flange closer than\none-half inch to the point of tangency of the knuckle of the flange. FIGURE 14-3.9(1)--WELD BUILD-UP OF WASTED AREAS\nImage\n\nWasted areas in stayed and unstayed surfaces may be\nbuilt up by welding provided that in the judgment of the authorized inspector\nthe strength of the structure will not be impaired. Where extensive weld\nbuild-up is employed, the authorized inspector may require an appropriate\nmethod of nondestructive examination for the complete surface of the\nrepair. FIGURE 14-3.9(2)\nREPAIRS FOR ACCESS OPENINGS\nImage\nA badly wasted manhole flange may be removed and\nreplaced with a ring-type frame as shown above. The requirements of 14-3.16(a)\nof flush patches shall be met. A full penetration weld shall be required. The\nweld may either be double welded or welded from one side with or without a\nbacking ring. Image\nA badly wasted area around a handhole opening shall be\nrepaired by adding a ring as shown above on the inside of the object. FIGURE 14-3.10(1)\nSEAL WELDING OF TUBES\nImage\n\nTubes may be seal welded provided the ends of the tubes\nhave sufficient wall thickness to prevent burn through. Seal welding shall be\napplied with a maximum of three light layers in lieu of one or two heavy\nlayers. In watertube boilers, tubes may be seal welded on the\ninside or outside of the tubesheet. FIGURE 14-3.10(2)\nSEAL WELDING OF RIVETED JOINTS\nImage\nTYPICAL RIVET JOINT SHOWING SEAL WELD\nSeal welding of rivited joints requires the approval of\nthe department. Seal welding may not be considered a strength weld. Seal\nwelding shall be applied in one light layer if practicable, but not more than\ntwo layers shall be used. Prior to welding, the area shall be examined by an\nappropriate method of nondestructive examination to assure that there are not\ncracks radiating from the rivet holes. If necessary, the rivets shall be\nremoved to assure complete examination of the area. Seal welding may not be\nperformed if cracks are present in riveted area. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-3.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
