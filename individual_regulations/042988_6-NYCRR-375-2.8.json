  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 375-2.8 - Remedial program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The goal of\nthe remedial program for a specific site is to restore that site to\npre-disposal conditions, to the extent feasible. At a minimum, the remedy\nselected shall eliminate or mitigate all significant threats to the public\nhealth and to the environment presented by contaminants disposed at the site\nthrough the proper application of scientific and engineering principles and in\na manner not inconsistent with the national oil and hazardous substances\npollution contingency plan as set forth in section 105 of CERCLA, as amended as\nby SARA. (b) Application of the\nsoil cleanup objectives. (1)\n\nThe remedial\nparty must utilize soil cleanup objectives that eliminate or mitigate the\nsignificant threat and are protective of public health and the environment. The\nremedial party, subject to department approval, may: (i) utilize the soil cleanup objectives, as\nset forth in section\n375-6.8\nof this Part; (ii)\ndevelop or modify site specific soil\ncleanup objectives, as set forth at section\n375-6.9\nof this Part; or\n(iii)\npropose site-specific soil cleanup\nobjectives which are protective of public health and the environment based upon\nother information. (2)\n\nThe soil component of the remedial program will consider the soil cleanup\nobjectives for unrestricted use, as set forth in Table 375-6.8(a) of this Part, as representative of pre-disposal conditions for remedial programs proceeding\nas set forth in subparagraph (1)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision, unless an\nimpact to ecological resources has been identified. (3)\n\nCleanup objectives for other media. The\nthreat to public health and the environment resulting from contamination in all\nother environmental media shall be evaluated in the development of remedial\nalternatives in the feasibility study to ensure that the remedial program meets\nthe requirements of this subdivision and section\n375-1.8\nof this Part. (c) Feasibility study. (1)\nA feasibility study shall be conducted by\nthe remedial party that develops and evaluates, using the factors in section\n375-1.8\n(f) of this\n\nPart, alternatives for all contaminated media identified by the remedial\ninvestigation of the site. (2)\n\nWhere soil contamination above the unrestricted use soil cleanup objectives is\nidentified by the remedial investigation, the feasibility study: (i) shall develop and evaluate one or more\nalternatives that achieve the unrestricted use soil cleanup objectives for\nsoil; and\n(ii)\nmay evaluate one or\nmore alternatives that achieve a restricted use of the site which may be\nproposed by the remedial party. Where a restricted use is proposed, the\nfeasibility study shall: (a) develop and\nevaluate alternatives to achieve the restricted use proposed by the remedial\nparty; and\n(b) develop and evaluate\nother alternatives, if directed by the department, which will achieve the same\nuse or a less restricted use of the site than that proposed by the remedial\nparty. (3)\n\nThe department may approve a remedial program for soil that: (i) utilizes different soil cleanup\nobjectives between different areas of a site, provided such areas can be\ndefined and described in the environmental easement and the necessary\ninstitutional and engineering controls can be effectively implemented, maintained, monitored and enforced through the site management plan; (ii)\nconsiders site specific background\nconcentrations, including the location of a site in areas of historic fill, in\nthe development of the remedy; and/or\n(iii)\nachieves a cleanup which is more\nstringent than the current, intended and reasonably anticipated future land\nuses of the site and its surroundings. (4)\n\nThe department shall select the remedy\nfor the site from among the feasible alternatives: (i) developed and evaluated by the\nfeasibility study; or\n(ii)\ndeveloped by the department in addition to those presented by the feasibility\nstudy. (d) Interim remedial measures. In the case of a site at which an interim remedial\nmeasure has been implemented, the department may determine, based on\nsite-specific circumstances including post-implementation investigation and/or\nmonitoring, that the interim remedial measure satisfies the goal of the\nremedial program for the site, where only continued implementation of the site\nmanagement plan associated with the interim remedial measure or other\nengineering or institutional controls is required. In which event the\ndepartment will propose the no further action alternative. Provided no other\noperable units remain for the site requiring action, the department may\nreclassify or delist the site according to section\n375-2.7\n(d) or (e)\nof this Subpart. (e) Remedy\nselection. The process of selecting a remedy shall be documented in a record of\ndecision, which includes the information identified below. (1)\nthe location and a description of the\nsite; (2)\na history of the\noperation of the site; (3)\nthe\ncurrent environmental and public health status of the site; (4)\nan enforcement history and current status\nof the site; (5)\n\nThe specific goals\nand objectives of the remedy selected for the site. (6)\na description and evaluation of the\nremedial alternatives considered, except in the case of no further action\nremedies; (7)\na summary of the\nbasis for the department's decision; (8)\na list of the documents the department\nused in its decisionmaking; and\n(9)\na responsiveness summary. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n375-2.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
