Tit. 15 § 71.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Destroyed, removed, altered, defaced or so covered as to be effectually concealed shall\nmean that there has been disfiguration, obliteration of detail, or change in\nthe outline or contour, to such an extent that the number has been rendered\nundecipherable or a plate or device upon which such number or identifying mark\nwas contained has been taken from the vehicle or part. (b) Unidentifiable. A motor vehicle, trailer\nor vehicle part shall be considered to be unidentifiable when peace officers of\nthe Department of Motor Vehicles are unable to locate and ascertain the\noriginal identification number or the special identification number in its\nassigned location after using acceptable methods for cleaning the specific\nareas involved, and using scientific procedures utilizing heat, chemicals, etc. in the restoration of numbers. A motor vehicle, trailer or vehicle part shall\nnot be considered unidentifiable if it is determined that no original\nidentification number or special identification number was ever embossed, engraved, etched or similarly marked by the manufacturer, or by any authorized\nagent of any state or commonwealth. A motor vehicle, trailer or vehicle part\nshall not be considered unidentifiable if the previous owner or current owner\ncan identify the motor vehicle, trailer or vehicle part by personal\nidentification. This in itself would not constitute ownership, but would serve\nas a basis for further investigation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
