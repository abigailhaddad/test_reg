Tit. 20 § 72.2 - Refusal to license\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 480 and 482-a\n(a) (1)\n\nWhere a person files an application for a license as a wholesale dealer of\ncigarettes, or for relicensing as a wholesale dealer, the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, in circumstances described herein, may refuse to license\nsuch applicant and may deny such application pursuant to the provision of this\nsection, provided an opportunity for a hearing has been afforded the\napplicant. (2)\n\nFor purposes of this\n\nPart, the term\ncontrolling person\nshall mean any person who\nis: (i) an officer, director or partner of an\napplicant for a license as a wholesale dealer of cigarettes or of a licensee; or\n(ii)\na shareholder of a\ncorporate applicant or licensee who directly or indirectly owns more than 10\npercent of the number of shares of stock of such applicant or licensee\nentitling the shareholder to vote for the election of the applicant's or\nlicensee's directors or trustees. In the case of a corporate applicant or\nlicensee which at the relevant time has four or fewer shareholders entitled to\nvote for the election of directors or trustees, in lieu of the more than 10\npercent threshold prescribed herein, a direct or indirect ownership of 25\npercent or more of the voting stock shall apply. (b) (1)\n\nThe Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay refuse to license or relicense the applicant if any tax imposed under the\n\nTax Law or by any law, ordinance or resolution enacted pursuant to the\nauthority of such law or the city earnings tax on nonresidents imposed pursuant\nto the authority of article two-E of the General City Law has been finally\ndetermined to be due from the applicant or from any controlling person and such\ntax has not been paid in full. (2)\n\nThe department may refuse to license or relicense the applicant if the\napplicant or any controlling person has been convicted within the preceding\nfive years of a crime provided for in the Tax Law. (3)\n\nThe department may refuse to license or\nrelicense the applicant if the license as a wholesale dealer of cigarettes of\nthe applicant has been cancelled or suspended as provided in section\n72.3\nof this Part within the preceding five years. (4)\n\nThe department may refuse to license or\nrelicense the applicant if the applicant or any controlling person was a\ncontrolling person of another cigarette wholesale dealer at a time when: (i) any tax imposed under the Tax Law or by\nany law, ordinance or resolution enacted pursuant to the authority of such law\nor the city earnings tax on nonresidents imposed pursuant to the authority of\narticle two-E of the General City Law was finally determined to be due from\nsuch other wholesale dealer and such tax has not been paid in full; (ii)\nsuch other wholesale dealer was\nconvicted of a crime provided for if the Tax Law, but only if such conviction\noccurred within the preceding five years; or\n(iii)\nthe license as a wholesale dealer of\ncigarettes of such other dealer was cancelled or suspended as provided in\nsection\n72.3\nof this Part, but only if such cancellation or suspension occurred within the\npreceding five years. (5)\n\nThe department may refuse to license or\nrelicense the applicant if the applicant or any controlling person has within\nthe preceding five years, committed any of the acts specified in section\n72.3\nof this Part. (6)\n\nThe department\nmay refuse to license or relicense the applicant if it has cause to believe\nthat such licensing would jeopardize the revenue due under article 20 of the\n\nTax Law, or the cigarette marketing standards contained in article 20-A of such\nlaw. For example, the department may request and evaluate any information\nconcerning an applicant's nature and scope of operations, reliability, overall\nfinancial status, liquidity or history of financial solvency and stability. Should the department determine that the applicant is not financially sound, lacks a legitimate profit motive or is seeking ostensible status as a wholesale\ndealer primarily for purposes of circumventing the Cigarette Marketing\n\nStandards Act, it may refuse to license or relicense the applicant. The\ndepartment may, in its discretion, license an applicant upon such terms and\nconditions as it may deem necessary for the protection of such revenue and\nstandards. (7)\n\nThe department may\nrefuse to license or relicense the applicant if the applicant or any\ncontrolling person has been finally determined to have violated any of the\nprovisions of article 20 or article 20-A of the Tax Law, or any rule or\nregulation adopted pursuant thereto.
