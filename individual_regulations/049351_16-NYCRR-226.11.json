Tit. 16 § 226.11 - Fixed pressure factor measurement installations-general conditions and installation and accuracy maintenance requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor customers receiving gas at pressures higher than the\nnormal delivery pressure, the utility may apply to department staff for\napproval to utilize the fixed pressure factor measurement method of determining\ncorrected actual gas usage. The fixed pressure factor measurement method, where\na constant elevated pressure is supplied to a meter, is a means of correcting\nvolume indicated on the meter index to base pressure conditions as specified in\nthe utility's tariff schedule. (a) Fixed pressure factor measurement methodology. Where fixed pressure factor\nmeasurement is used, the amount of gas consumption shall be multiplied either\nmechanically or by a calculated factor derived from the following formula: Billing multiplier = ((Pb+Pm)/P\nB\n)\n\nWhere Pb is the average barometric pressure for the\nutility's service area(s), measured in PSI. Pm is the delivery or metering\npressure measured in PSIG and P\nB\nis the base condition\npressure defined in the utility's tariff schedule. (b) Correction for average barometric\npressure. Where the average barometric pressure varies by more than 0.10 PSIA\nwithin the utility's franchise territory, the average barometric pressure for\nthat geographic location shall be calculated based on that location's elevation\nabove sea level. (c) Fixed pressure\nmeasurement installation requirements. At each installation where fixed\npressure factor measurement is utilized, the following installation\nrequirements must be met: (1)\n\nThe outlet set\npressure to the customer's meter will be maintained under operating conditions\nto within +- 1.0 percent of the absolute set pressure. (2)\n\nEach pressure regulator shall be\nprotected in a manner that would clearly indicate any unauthorized tampering\nwith the outlet pressure adjustment screw. (3)\n\nAll fixed pressure factor measurement\ninstallations shall be clearly identified with the pressure regulation outlet\nset pressure and the billing multiplier. (d) Fixed pressure factor accuracy\nmaintenance requirements. The utility shall, at each fixed pressure factor\nmeasurement installation, verify the pressure regulation outlet set pressure\ninitially and at periodic intervals, no less frequent than annually, thereafter. No fixed pressure factor measurement installation shall be\ninstalled or left in service where the resulting overall measurement proof is\nless than 99.0 percent nor more than 101.0 percent. (e) Fixed pressure factor measurement\nrecords. The utility shall maintain records of all active fixed pressure factor\nmeasurement installations and the results of any maintenance performed at each\ninstallation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n226.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
