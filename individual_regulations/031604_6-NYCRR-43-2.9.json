  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 43-2.9 - Vessel monitoring system requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Effective January 1, 2011, all persons\neligible to be issued a surfclam/ocean quahog Atlantic Ocean owner's permit for\nsurfclam harvest under an individual fishing quota (IFQ) must have installed on\nthe vessel an operational vessel monitoring system (VMS) unit that is approved\nby the department prior to the issuance of such permit. The vessel owner must\nactivate the VMS unit and provide verification of vendor activation from a\ndepartment approved VMS vendor. All VMS vendors that are on an approved Federal\nlist maintained by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for the\nsurfclam individual transferable quota program in the exclusive economic zone\n(EEZ) will be deemed acceptable for use in the New York State surfclam IFQ\nfishery provided such vendors continue to satisfy the criteria as a\nNMFS-approved vendor. Verification of vendor activation may be undertaken by\ncompleting, signing, and mailing or faxing a VMS certification form to the\ndepartment. (b) It is unlawful to\ntamper with or input false positions or fishery-related information into any\nVMS required under this section. The VMS shall be fully automated and\noperational at all times, regardless of weather and environmental conditions, unless exempted by the department. (c) The VMS shall be capable of tracking\nvessels in the waters of the marine and coastal district and all U.S. waters in\nthe Atlantic Ocean from the shoreline of each coastal state to a line 15 nm\noffshore and shall provide position accuracy to within 400 m (1,300 ft). The\nVMS shall be capable of transmitting and storing information including vessel\nidentification, date, time, and latitude/longitude. (d) The VMS shall provide accurate position\ntransmissions at a frequency of every 15 minutes of every day of the year\nunless otherwise directed or exempted by the department. In addition, the VMS\nshall allow polling of individual vessels or any set of vessels at any time, and receive position reports in real time. For the purposes of this section, \"real time\" shall constitute data that reflect a delay of 15 minutes or less\nbetween the displayed information and the vessel's actual position. (e) The VMS shall be capable of providing\nnetwork message communications between the vessel and shore. The VMS shall\nallow the department to initiate communications or data transfer at any\ntime. (f) The VMS shall be capable\nof providing vessel locations relative to the demarcation line of the New York\n\nState boundary and waters of the EEZ. (g) The VMS vendor must be capable of\ntransmitting position data to a department designated computer system via a\nmodem and in a file format acceptable to the department. The VMS vendor shall\nbe capable of archiving vessel position histories for a minimum of one year and\nproviding transmission to the department of specified portions of archived data\nin response to any and all requests from the department. (h) It is unlawful for any vessel to take, possess, offload or attempt to take, possess or offload surfclams under an IFQ\nwithout a fully operational and approved VMS. (i) All VMS units installed on a vessel\noperating under an IFQ must transmit a signal indicating the vessel's accurate\nposition at least every 15 minutes, 24 hours per day, throughout the year\nunless exempted by the department. A vessel owner may apply for a letter of\nexemption from the VMS transmitting requirements of this section by sending a\nwritten request to the department. In order for a vessel to be considered for\nexemption, one or more of the requirements must be met: The vessel must be\ncontinuously out of the water for more than 72 consecutive hours or the vessel\nwill not engage in harvest of surfclams from the New York State waters of the\n\nAtlantic Ocean for a minimum period of 30 consecutive days. The following\ninformation must be included in such written request: Identification of the\nvessel requesting the exemption; the location of the vessel during the time an\nexemption is sought; the exact time period for which an exemption is needed\nindicating the time the VMS signal will be turned off and turned on again; and, reason supporting the request for exemption. Any requests for exemption shall\nbe subject to approval by the Director of the Division of Marine\n\nResources. (j) Any vessel exempted\nfrom the VMS transmitting requirements of this section must keep a copy of the\nletter of exemption onboard the vessel at all times, and the vessel may not\nturn off the VMS signal until the letter of exemption has been received. It is\nunlawful for any vessel granted an exemption to be used to harvest, possess or\noffload surfclams taken from the certified waters of the Atlantic\n\nOcean. (k) If a new or replacement\nVMS is necessary, the vessel owner must submit documentation to the department, within three days of the installation and prior to the vessel's next trip, verifying that the new VMS unit is an operational, approved system as described\nin this section. Vessel owners must confirm the VMS operation and\ncommunications service to the department as required under this\nsection. (l) If a VMS unit fails to\ntransmit a signal of the vessel's position every 15 minutes, the vessel shall\nbe deemed in violation of this section unless there is sufficient evidence\ndocumenting that the failure of the VMS to transmit was due to an unavoidable\nmalfunction or disruption of the transmission. (m) Vessel owners or captain/operators issued\na surfclam/ocean quahog permit under this section for fishing in the IFQ\nprogram are required to declare their intended fishing activity via VMS prior\nto leaving port. Owners or operators that are transiting between ports or\nfishing in a fishery other than the New York State surfclam fishery must either\ndeclare out of fisheries or declare the appropriate fishery, if required, via\nthe VMS unit before leaving port. No vessel shall attempt to take, harvest, possess or offload surfclams from the certified water of the Atlantic Ocean\nunless they have complied with the declaration and notification requirements of\nthis section.
