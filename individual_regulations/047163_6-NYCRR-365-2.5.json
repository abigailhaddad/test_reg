  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 365-2.5 - Design and operating requirements\n\nState Regulations\nA facility required to obtain a permit under this Subpart\nmust, in addition to the requirements identified in section\n360.19\nof this Title, design, construct, maintain, and operate the facility in compliance with the following\ncriteria. (a) An RMW tracking document\nmust be received for each shipment of RMW accepted at the facility. The\nfacility must not accept waste from unauthorized off-site sources (e.g., self-transporters, generators not authorized by the permit, etc.), or waste\nwhich is not accompanied by a tracking document. The tracking form must be\ncompleted as required as specified in the instructions on the form. (b) A fixed radiation detection unit must be\ninstalled and operated at a location appropriate for the monitoring of all\nincoming RMW. In addition: (1)\nthe\ninvestigation alarm set point of the radiation detector must be set at least\ntwo times but no greater than five times background radiation levels; (2)\nthe concentration of radiation in any\nwaste received may not exceed background radiation levels; (3)\nbackground radiation readings at the\nfacility must be measured and recorded at least daily; (4)\nfield checks of the radiation detector\nutilizing a known radiation source must be performed and recorded at least\nweekly; (i) the radiation detector must be\ncalibrated at least annually or more often as recommended by the manufacturer, and documentation describing the calibration must be maintained at the\nfacility; and\n(ii)\neach instance in\nwhich the radiation detector is triggered by a waste load must be documented\nand reported to the department by the next business day following the event. Recorded information must include the date the waste was received, transporter\nname, origin of the waste, truck number or other identifying marking, detector\nreading, disposition of the waste, and date of disposition. (c) For storage and\ntransfer facilities, the RMW must be maintained in the packaging as received, unless otherwise approved by the department. If any packages are broken, leaking or are otherwise compromised, the RMW must be handled as outlined in\nthe contingency plan. The RMW may only be surrendered to a transporter\npermitted to transport RMW under Part 364 of this Title. (d) Incoming RMW must be handled in\naccordance with the following criteria. (1)\nRMW must not be accepted unless there is sufficient storage, transfer or\ntreatment capacity. (2)\nRMW must be\ninspected prior to unloading to ensure the RMW has been packaged appropriately. If any packages are broken, leaking or otherwise compromised, the RMW must be\nhandled as outlined in the contingency plan. Containers of RMW must not be\nopened for inspection unless authorized by the department. (3)\nRMW shipment in bulk packaging cannot be\naccepted, unless approved by the department as part of the waste control\nplan. (4)\n\nThe facility must record\nthe date of arrival of each waste load at the facility, the original generator\nidentification, package type and weight or volume, and the intended disposition\nof the waste. These documents may be maintained electronically. (e) RMW handling and storage. (1)\n\nEntry to the facility must be secured and\ncontrolled at all times through the use of gates or other means. (2)\nA sign must be conspicuously posted at\neach entrance to the facility that identifies the types of waste that are\nacceptable for delivery to the facility and the types of wastes that are not\naccepted at the facility. This sign must be a minimum of 12 inches high by 18\ninches wide and have lettering a minimum of one inch in height. Signs that read\n\"CAUTION -REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE. VISITORS AND UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL MUST\nREPORT TO THE OFFICE.\" must be posted at each entrance to the facility. These\nsigns must include the universal biohazard warning symbol. (3)\nRMW must be completely contained and\nsecured during storage and with appropriate blocking and bracing when moved by\na vehicle during transport. (4)\nRMW\nstorage and handling procedures must minimize potential occupational exposures\nand release to the environment. (5)\n\nContainers must be stored in an upright, stable and controlled manner that\nminimizes the potential for leakage. The top of the stacked containers must not\nbe more than eight feet above the level of the floor. The containers must not\nbe compromised by the manner of storage. (6)\n\nUnauthorized wastes may be temporarily\nstored in areas specifically designed for these wastes on the facility site in\naccordance with the waste control plan. (7)\n\nAll buildings must be fully enclosed and\nmust have an impermeable floor. (8)\nRMW must not be processed to reduce the size prior to treatment, unless\napproved by the department as part of the operation and maintenance\nplan. (9)\nRMW must not be compacted\nor compressed. RMW placed into bins for consolidation or treatment must be\ncontrolled to minimize aerosolization. (10)\n\nTrash chutes or slides cannot be used to\nmove RMW between containers, vehicles, or treatment devices unless the movement\nis controlled to maintain the integrity of the containers. (11)\n\nVehicles must be unloaded in a manner\nthat does not cause containers to break or otherwise release RMW. (12)\n\nStorage of RMW that has the ability to\nbecome putrescent is limited to: (i) three\ndays if the RMW is stored at 45 degrees Fahrenheit (seven degrees Celsius) or\ngreater; (ii)\nseven days if the RMW\nis stored at less than 45 degrees Fahrenheit (seven degrees Celsius) but\ngreater than 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius); and\n(iii)\n30 days if the RMW is stored at 32\ndegrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) or lower. (13)\nRMW which becomes putrescent must be\ntreated, refrigerated, or removed from the facility as soon as\npracticable. (14)\n\nNon-putrescent\nRMW can be stored above 45 degrees Fahrenheit (seven degrees Celsius) for a\nmaximum of 15 days, and a maximum of 30 days if stored at or below 45 degrees\n\nFahrenheit (seven degrees Celsius). (15)\n\nTreated RMW must be removed from the\nfacility within 30 days. (16)\n\nThe\nfacility must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition, and implement a\nwritten schedule of appropriate cleaning and disinfection. (17)\n\nThe unloading and loading areas must be\nadequately sized and designed to facilitate efficient transfer of RMW to and\nfrom the collection vehicles and the unobstructed movement of vehicles. All\nunloading and loading must be performed within a building and on a covered\nconcrete or asphalt surface. (f) RMW recovery and recycling. Recovery of\nRMW for third-party reprocessing of medical devices, or for reuse or recycling\nof materials must comply with the following. (1)\nRMW and used medical devices generated\nfrom neurosurgery cannot be recovered or recycled. (2)\n\nUsed medical devices may be sent to a\nreprocessor for preparation for reuse without treatment. (3)\n\nUsed medical devices source separated at\nhealthcare facilities that are managed at RMW processing facilities must be\ntransported directly to the manufacturer, reprocessor or\nremanufacturer. (4)\n\nRecovery, segregation and sorting of used medical devices from RMW received from\nhealthcare facilities. Recovery, segregation and sorting must employ robotic or\nmechanical equipment, and control the release of microorganisms during\nprocessing. (5)\nRMW to be recycled\nmust be treated with an autoclave in accordance with the RMW treatment\nrequirements of sections\n365-2.6\nand\n365-2.7\nof this Part prior to being\nsent for recycling. (6)\n\nBio-challenge testing must be conducted in accordance with this Subpart for\neach load of waste treated before recycling. Bio-challenge testing must\ndemonstrate no growth in 'Bacillus' spores for each load of waste proposed to\nbe recycled. (7)\n\nMaterials\nrecovered for recycling from the RMW stream must be stored at the treatment\nfacility until results of bio-challenge testing results have been obtained. If\nresults indicate that treatment was not sufficient, the materials must be\ntreated again and retested. (g) The facility must maintain financial\nassurance in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of closure of the facility\nas specified by sections\n360.21\nand\n360.22\nof this Title. (h) The facility must provide proof of\nliability insurance or other form of financial security deemed sufficient by\nthe department to meet all responsibilities in case of release of RMW waste to\nthe environment causing contamination.
