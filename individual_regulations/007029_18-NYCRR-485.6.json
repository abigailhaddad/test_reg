(3)\n\nIf more than one\napplicant proposes to establish an adult care facility in the same prescribed\ngeographic area or to serve the same population, approval shall not be based\nsolely on the date of application. The department will compare such factors as\ndemonstrated competence, financial feasibility, the adequacy of the proposed\nprogram of care and services and the responsiveness of the application to the\npublic need. (4)\nA public hearing\nmay be held by the department at its discretion to solicit comments and\nrecommendations regarding the proposed adult home. (b) Character and competence. (1)\n\nDetermination of the adequacy of the\napplicant's character, competence and standing in the community of the proposed\nprogram, shall be made on assessment and verification of the information\nsubmitted by the applicant or solicited from other sources by the department, and shall be based upon such factors as financial status, education, experience, past or current performance in the management and operation of\nadult care facilities or like services to dependent adults; past business\nassociations; letters of personal recommendation; information acquired through\ncredit review, review of related public documents, public comment, or\ncollateral contacts.
