  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 452.5 - Operating certificates: general provisions, enforcement and hearings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Issuance. An\noperating certificate will be issued to a residential program for victims of\ndomestic violence only when it has been determined after a review of the\ncompleted application and supporting documentation submitted by the program, and an onsite inspection of the domestic violence shelter or domestic violence\nmixed occupancy shelter by the Office, has determined the program is in\ncompliance with all applicable regulations. (b) Duration. An operating certificate will\nbe valid for up to three years from date of issuance and only for the premises\nspecified and may be limited, suspended or revoked at any time for failure to\ncomply with regulations of the Office or for just cause. (c) General provisions. (1)\n\nThe certificate must be prominently\ndisplayed in the shelter, domestic violence program or mixed occupancy shelter, network office, or sponsoring agency office. (2)\n\nThe certificate will specify the maximum\nnumber of residents who may be in residence at the residential program for\nvictims of domestic violence at any one time, or the maximum number of safe\nhomes or safe dwellings which may be approved. For domestic violence sponsoring\nagencies, the certificate will also specify the maximum number of residents for\neach safe dwelling at any one time. (3)\n\nThere will be no fee for the issuance of\nan operating certificate. (4)\n\nCertificates are not transferable. (d) Enforcement actions. Any violation of\napplicable statutes or regulations may be a basis for OCFS to limit, suspend, revoke or terminate an operating certificate, or for just cause. (1)\n\nAs outlined in section\n452.8\n(f) of this\nsubpart, the Office must provide a written report to the provider identifying\nany regulatory violations and a time frame for the correction. Failure on the\npart of the provider to complete corrective action within the timeframe\nspecified or approved by the Office will constitute sufficient cause for the\n\nOffice to commence enforcement action to limit, suspend or revoke an operating\ncertificate. (2)\n\nThe Office may\nlimit an operating certificate to restrict any aspect of program operations\nuntil deficient conditions are corrected, and the program is deemed to be in\ncompliance with regulations. Limiting an operating certificate includes, but is\nnot restricted to, actions such as the closing or reducing of program\nadmissions, reducing the total number of persons who may receive services\nthrough the program or eliminating or modifying any aspect of the program or\nprogram services. (3)\n\nThe Office\nmay suspend an operating certificate for a period of time until the program can\ndemonstrate that it has corrected the endangering conditions or deficiencies\nand is in compliance with the regulations. During the period of suspension, a\nprogram must not provide residential services to eligible\nindividuals. (4)\n\nThe Office may\nrevoke an operating certificate for the remainder of its designated term based\nupon the presence of endangering conditions or significant deficiencies. In\nthis situation, the residential program is deemed to be closed and is no longer\nauthorized to provide residential services to eligible individuals. (e) Hearings. (1)\n\nBefore an operating certificate is\nlimited, suspended, or revoked, the Office will provide at least 30 days prior\nnotice to the provider or applicant of the time and place of the hearing in\naccordance with the procedures established in Part 343 of this Title. (i) The limitation, suspension or revocation\nwill become final if the applicant or holder fails to request an adjournment\nwithin the 30-day period or does not appear at the hearing. (ii)\n\nThe Office may require the program to\npost the revocation of licensure on the premises of the facility. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision, an operating certificate may be temporarily limited or\nsuspended in its terms without a hearing upon a finding by the Office that\nhealth, safety or welfare of a resident is in imminent danger. In such\ncircumstances, the Office will provide written notification to the residential\nprogram. (i) The provider has 10 days from\nthe date of the temporary limitation or suspension of the operating certificate\nto request a hearing from the Office. Such request must be made in\nwriting. (ii)\n\nFailure to contest\nthe temporary limitation or suspension will be prima facie evidence that the\nfinding of imminent danger is valid, and the temporary suspension will continue\nin effect until the Office has determined the condition requiring such\nsuspension is corrected or the operating certificate is permanently revoked or\nterminated. (iii)\n\nThe temporary\nsuspension will continue in effect until the Office has determined that the\ncondition requiring such suspension is corrected, the operating certificate is\npermanently revoked or terminated, or a hearing decision orders the lifting of\nthe suspension or limitation. (3)\nA notice of hearing will be served in\nperson or by certified mail addressed to the provider at the last address\nprovided to the Office, at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing. The\nnotice will specify the time and place of the hearing, the proposed action and\nthe charges which are the basis for the proposed actions. The charges will\nspecify the statutes, rules and regulations, or other applicable requirements\nof law with which the provider failed to comply and will include a brief\nstatement of the facts pertaining to such noncompliance. (4)\n\nWhen an enforcement is commenced against\na provider that operates multiple residential domestic violence facilities, the\n\nOffice may assess the health and safety of the residents in the other domestic\nviolence facilities operated by the provider and take appropriate action to\nprotect the health and safety of the residents when warranted.
