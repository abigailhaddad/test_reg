  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 81.1 - Registration of chain stores\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 480, 483(a), 489\n(a) Every chain store, including a vending\nmachine operator, a cooperative member, a franchisee and a large volume outlet\noperator, must register with the Department of Taxation and Finance. No person\nshall be considered to be a chain store for purposes of the Cigarette Marketing\n\nStandards Act unless such person has been granted and publicly displays, in\nsuch person's place of business, a certificate of chain store registration. The\ncertificate of registration granted to a chain store by the department is\npersonal to the person to whom it is granted and such certificate is not\nassignable. (See sections\n72.1\nand\n81.2\nof this Title for assignments of licenses and the application of the wholesale\ndealer provisions to the registration of chain stores.)\n(b) (1)\n\nAn\napplication for a certificate of registration as a chain store must be made on\na form prescribed by the Department of Taxation and Finance for such purpose\nand must fully disclose all of the information requested therein. Such\napplication must be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $300 in the form of a\nbank check, certified check (or other guaranteed draft acceptable to the\ndepartment) or money order, made payable to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance, unless such fee has been paid during the preceding 12 months, in which\ncase, the fee for registration shall be $200. Provided, however, the fee for\nregistration of a chain store that is a vending machine operator shall be $250, unless such fee has been paid during the preceding 12 months, in which case, the fee shall be $200. Every qualifying group of 15 or more commonly owned\nretail outlets, vending machine operator, cooperative member, franchisee and\nlarge volume outlet operator who or which wishes to register as a chain store, must file such application and remit the appropriate registration fee. A single\nregistration fee shall be applicable to each classification of chain store, regardless of the number of retail outlets, vending machines, separate outlets\nor other establishments owned, operated or maintained by the applicant and its\naffiliates. (2)\n\nThe department will\nreview the information submitted by the applicant and may for cause refuse to\nregister such applicant. Upon approval of an application for a certificate of\nregistration as a chain store, the department will issue, for prominent public\ndisplay, an individual certificate of registration for each of a chain store's\nbusiness locations, other than individual vending machines. Each certificate\nshall bear the address of the appropriate place of business and a common chain\nstore identification number. Failure to display such certificate(s) will\nconstitute a violation of article 20-A of the Tax Law. (3)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided, a\ncertificate of registration as a chain store shall continue in effect until\ncancelled or suspended by the department or until surrendered by the\nregistrant. (c) (1)\n\nThe Department of Taxation and Finance, in order to insure compliance with the cigarette marketing standards contained\nin article 20-A of the Tax Law, may periodically review the status of a\nregistered chain store and may, at any time, require a chain store to submit to\nthe department any information necessary for the completion of such\nreview. (2)\n\nNot more often than\nonce every three years, the department (in order to properly administer the\n\nCigarette Marketing Standards Act contained in article 20-A of such law) may\nrequire every registered chain store to file a new application for\nregistration, again comply with, or prove its compliance with, all of the\nrequirements of the Tax Law and this Title in relation to chain stores and to\nsurrender its existing registration as a chain store. (d) A chain store must immediately inform the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, in writing, of any changes to the\ninformation submitted in the application for registration as a chain store or\nas otherwise last reported to the department, including, but not limited to, the addition or deletion of any retail outlets, vending machines, separate\noutlets or other establishments owned, operated or maintained by the chain\nstore.
