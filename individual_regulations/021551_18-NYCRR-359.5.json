  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 359.5 - Commencement of the administrative disqualification hearings process\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon\ndiscovering and determining that an intentional program violation may have\noccurred, the social services district must document the determination and\nreach a conclusion as to whether the documented acts constitute an intentional\nprogram violation in accordance with the standards described in section\n359.3\nof this Part. (b) If the social services district concludes\nthat the documented acts resulted in an intentional program violation and that\nreferral, in accordance with section\n359.4\nof this Part, to the\nappropriate prosecutor authorized to act on the matter, is not warranted or not\npossible due to the amount in issue, the social services district may process\nthe case for an administrative disqualification hearing. (c) If, pursuant to section\n359.4\nof this Part, the social\nservices district refers an overpayment or over-issuance to the appropriate\nprosecutor authorized to act on the matter, and that prosecutor declines to\nprosecute or fails to take action on the referral within a reasonable period of\ntime, and the social services district elects to initiate the process for an\nadministrative disqualification hearing pursuant to this section, the social\nservices district must formally withdraw in writing the referral to the\nprosecutor before referring the case to the department. Failure to present\nevidence of such a formal written withdrawal either in its evidentiary\ntransmittal to the department or at the hearing may result in an administrative\ndisqualification hearing decision adverse to the social services\ndistrict. (d) (1)\n\nIf the social services district elects to\nprocess a case for an administrative disqualification hearing, it must assemble\ndocumentary evidence which the district believes is sufficient on its face to\nsupport its determination of intentional program violation and forward the\nevidence in the form of an evidentiary packet to the Office of Administrative\n\nHearings, New York State Department of Social Services, with a request that the\ndepartment schedule an administrative disqualification hearing. (2)\n\nIf the social services district processes\na case for an administrative disqualification hearing for an FS-IPV and the\nfactual issues arise from the same or related circumstances as a case for a\npublic assistance-IPV, the cases must be consolidated and the social services\ndistrict must submit with the evidentiary packet required by this subdivision, a statement of the particular intentional program violation(s) being alleged\nand the sanction sought to be imposed for each such intentional program\nviolation being alleged. (e) The evidentiary packet forwarded by the\nsocial services district to the department accompanying the social services\ndistrict's request for an administrative disqualification hearing must have\nconsecutively numbered pages, must be submitted in three copies for each\naccused individual and must include, but not be limited to, the following: (1)\nthe full name (including middle name), the complete address (including county of residence), the social security\nnumber, the case number and the date of birth of the person(s) charged and\nagainst whom a disqualification penalty is sought; (2)\na list of the particular charge(s) and\nthe individual or individuals against whom a disqualification penalty is\nsought, together with any statement required by paragraph (d)(2) of this\nsection if cases are consolidated; (3)\na summary of the evidence to be\nintroduced; (4)\na listing of the\nnames, titles and phone numbers of all social services district personnel and\nwitnesses who will appear in support of the determination; (5)\nan itemized list of all the exhibits\nincluded in the packet with the page number(s) on which each exhibit is\nfound; (6)\ncopies of all documents\nto be used in support of the social services district's\ndetermination; (7)\ninformation as\nto when and where the original evidence exhibits submitted in the case may be\nreviewed; (8)\ninformation as to the\navailability of free legal services; and\n(9)\na statement indicating whether the\nindividual previously has been determined to have committed an intentional\nprogram violation by either a court of competent jurisdiction or an\nadministrative disqualification hearing decision or whether the individual\npreviously has waived attendance at an administrative disqualification hearing\nor previously has signed a DCA. If the person previously has been determined to\nhave committed an intentional program violation or previously has waived\nattendance at an administrative disqualification hearing or previously has\nsigned a DCA, supporting documentation of such facts must be included in the\nevidentiary packet. (f) Upon receipt of a social services district's request for a hearing and\naccompanying evidentiary packet, the department will review the packet to\ndetermine if it contains sufficient documentary evidence to substantiate that\nan individual has committed one or more intentional program violations in\naccordance with the standards described in section\n359.3\nof this Part. The department\nalso will determine whether the evidentiary packet satisfies the provisions of\nsubdivision (e) of this section. (g) If the department's review of the\nevidentiary packet indicates that there is either insufficient documentary\nevidence to establish that an intentional program violation was committed or\nthat the packet does not comply with the provisions of subdivision (e) of this\nsection, the department will return the packet to the social services district\nand not schedule a hearing.
