Tit. 6 §§ 242-8.7 - CO[2] budget units that co-fire eligible biomass\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The CO\n2\nauthorized\naccount representative of a CO\n2\nbudget unit that\nco-fires eligible biomass as a compliance mechanism under this Part shall\nreport the following information to the Department or its agent for each\ncalendar quarter: (1)\n\nFor each shipment of\nsolid eligible biomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget\nunit, the total eligible biomass fuel input, on an as-fired basis, in\npounds. (2)\n\nFor each shipment of\nsolid eligible biomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget\nunit, the moisture content, on an as-fired basis, as a fraction by\nweight. (3)\n\nFor each distinct type\nof gaseous eligible biomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget\nunit, the density of the biogas, on an as-fired basis, in pounds per standard\ncubic foot. (4)\n\nFor each distinct\ntype of gaseous eligible biomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget unit, the moisture content of the biogas, as a fraction by total\nweight. (5)\n\nFor each distinct type\nof gaseous eligible biomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget\nunit, the total eligible biomass fuel input, in standard cubic feet. (6)\n\nFor each distinct type of eligible\nbiomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget unit, the dry basis\ncarbon content of the fuel type, as a fraction by dry weight. (7)\n\nFor each distinct type of eligible\nbiomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget unit, the dry basis\nhigher heating value, in MMBtu per dry pound. (8)\n\nFor each distinct type of eligible\nbiomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget unit, the total dry\nbasis eligible biomass fuel input, in pounds, calculated in accordance with\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (9)\n\nThe total amount of\nCO\n2\nemitted from the CO\n2\nbudget\nunit due to firing eligible biomass fuel, in tons, calculated in accordance\nwith subdivision (c) of this section. (10)\n\nFor each distinct type of eligible\nbiomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget unit, the total\neligible biomass fuel heat input, in MMBtu, calculated in accordance with\nparagraph (d)(1) of this section. (11)\n\nThe total amount of heat input to the\nCO\n2\nbudget unit due to firing eligible biomass fuel, in\nMMBtu, calculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this\nsection. (12)\n\nDescription and\ndocumentation of monitoring technology employed, and description and\ndocumentation of fuel sampling methodology employed, including sampling\nfrequency; and, (13)\n\nFor each\ndistinct type of eligible biomass fuel fired at the CO\n2\nbudget unit, chemical analysis, including heating value and carbon\ncontent. (b) An owner or\noperator of a CO\n2\nbudget unit shall calculate and submit\nto the Department or its agent on a quarterly basis the total dry weight for\neach distinct type of eligible biomass fired by the CO\n2\nbudget unit during the reporting quarter. The total dry weight shall be\ndetermined for each fuel type as follows: (1)\n\nFor solid fuel types: m\nF\nj\n= S (1 - M\ni\n) x F\ni\ni = 1\nwhere: F\nj\n= Total eligible biomass dry\nbasis fuel input (lbs) for fuel type j; F\ni\n= Eligible biomass as fired\nfuel input (lbs) for fired shipment i; M\ni\n= Moisture content (fraction)\nfor fired shipment i; i = fired fuel shipment; j = fuel type; and, m = number of shipments. (2)\n\nFor gaseous fuel types: F\nj\n= D\nj\nx\nV\nj\nx (1 - M\nj\n)\nwhere: F\nj\n= Total eligible biomass dry\nbasis fuel input (lbs) for fuel type j; D\nj\n= Density of biogas (lbs/scf)\nfor fuel type j; V\nj\n= Total volume (scf) for fuel\ntype j; M\nj\n= Moisture content (fraction)\nfor fuel type j, j = fuel type. (c) CO\n2\nemissions due\nto firing of eligible biomass shall be determined as follows: (1)\n\nFor any full calendar quarter during\nwhich no fuel other than eligible biomass is combusted at the\nCO\n2\nbudget unit, as measured and recorded in accordance\nwith sections 242-8.1 through\n242-8.6\nof this Subpart; or\n(2)\n\nFor any full calendar\nquarter during which fuels other than eligible biomass are combusted at the\nCO\n2\nbudget unit, as determined using the following\nequation: n\nCO\n2\ntons = S\nF\nj\nx C\nj\nx\nO\nj\nx 44/12 x 0.0005\nj = 1\nwhere: CO\n2\ntons =\nCO\n2\nemissions due to firing of eligible biomass for the\nreporting quarter; F\nj\n= Total eligible biomass dry\nbasis fuel input (lbs) for fuel type j, as calculated in subdivision (b) of\nthis section; C\nj\n= carbon fraction (dry basis)\nfor fuel type j; O\nj\n= Oxidation factor for eligible\nbiomass fuel type j, derived for solid fuels based on the ash content of the\neligible biomass fired and the carbon content of this ash, as determined\npursuant to paragraph (a) (12) of this section; for gaseous eligible biomass\nfuels, a default oxidation factor of 0.995 may be used; 44/12 = The number of tons of carbon dioxide that are\ncreated when one ton of carbon is combusted (44/12); 0.0005 = The number of short tons which is equal to one\npound; j = fuel type; and, n = number of distinct fuel types. (d) Heat input due to firing of\neligible biomass for each quarter shall be determined as follows: (1)\n\nFor each distinct fuel type: H\nj\n= F\nj\nx\nHHV\nj\nwhere: H\nj\n= Heat input (MMBtu) for fuel\ntype j; F\nj\n= Total eligible biomass dry\nbasis fuel input (lbs) for fuel type j, as calculated in subdivision (b) of\nthis section; HHV\nj\n= Higher heating value\n(MMBtu/lb), dry basis, for fuel type j, as determined through chemical\nanalysis; j = fuel type. (2)\n\nFor all fuel types: n\n\nHeat Input MMBtu = S H\nj\nj = 1\nwhere: H\nj\n= Heat input (MMBtu) for fuel\ntype j; j = fuel type; and, n = number of distinct fuel types. (e) Fuel sampling methods and fuel\nsampling technology shall be consistent with the New York State Renewable\n\nPortfolio Standard Biomass Power Guide Version 2.0 June 2018 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this\n\nTitle).
