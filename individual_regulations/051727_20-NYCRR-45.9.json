  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 45.9 - Sales for resale\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Receipts\nfrom sales or services for ultimate consumption or use by the purchaser in this\n\nState are taxable, but receipts from sales for resale, as distinguished from\nsales for consumption, are not taxable. Question 37: The A gas company in New York sells and delivers to the B\ngas company in New York two million cubic feet of gas, which the B company\nresells to consumers. Are the receipts from the sale of A to B taxable?\nAnswer: No. (b) The determination of whether a sale or\nservice is for consumption or use, or for resale, is often difficult. The\nproblem arises most frequently in the case of sales to owners or lessees of\nloft buildings, office buildings, apartment houses, hotels, etc., where the\nseller does not know if the product is all to be resold, or whether some of it\nis to be resold and some used by the purchaser, and if so, how much. The\nfollowing method of handling such situations is suggested: (1)\n\nThe original seller shall include in its\ngross income all receipts from such sales but may take a deduction for the\namount resold by the purchaser at its (the vendor's) sales price. If the\noriginal seller has not, at the time the report for a given period is being\nrendered, received information from his purchaser of the number of units\nresold, the deduction may be claimed in a succeeding period when the\ninformation is received. (2)\n\nIn\ncase the product is sold by the original seller at graduated rates, based upon\nthe quantity sold, the average sale price shall be used as the basis for\nclaiming credit on account of resales by the vendee. (3)\n\nIf a utility does not wish to use the\nforegoing method, it may submit to the State Tax Commission, for approval, the\nplan it desires to use. Question 38: A utility sells 15,000 kilowatt hours of electricity to an\noffice building during the month of July, 1950, which is billed as\nfollows: Demand charge....... $100\n10,000 K.W.H. at four cents....... 400\n5,000 K.W.H at two cents....... 100\n$600\n\nThe average price per K.W.H. is, therefore, four cents. The\noffice building uses 7,000 K.W.H. and resells 8,000 K.W.H. to its tenants. How\nshould the utility determine its tax?\nAnswer: The utility will\ninclude $600 in its gross income for the month of July, 1950, and will, claim a\ndeduction of $320 from its gross income on account of the 8,000 K.W.H. resold\nby the office building. The same method will apply in the case of sales of gas, steam, water or refrigeration. (c) Where a hotel or apartment house\nfurnishes telephone service to its guests or tenants and provides such service\nthrough facilities of a telephone company, the hotel or apartment house is\nconsidered as the consumer or user of all service, whether used by the hotel or\napartment house or by its guests or tenants, and the entire receipts of the\ntelephone company from telephone service furnished to such hotel or apartment\nhouse, will be included in its gross income. Local or toll messages furnished\nto guests or tenants are not considered resales by the hotel or apartment\nhouse, but are sales by the telephone company direct to the guests or tenants, through the medium of the hotel or apartment house. To the extent that a hotel\nor apartment house supplements the facilities and services rendered its guests\nor tenants, by making available to them the facilities and services of the\ntelephone company, the hotel or apartment house is considered as being engaged\nin the business of selling telephone service and shall include in its gross\noperating income its entire receipts from such supplemental service. (See\nsections under Part 46-Gross Operating Income.) Thus, the telephone company\nwill pay a tax upon the amount which it receives from the sale of telephone\nservice and the hotel on the amount which it receives from the sale of\nsupplemental telephone service. Question 39: A telephone company furnishes service to a hotel, which\nuses part of such service in the operation of the hotel. Guest calls, both\nlocal and toll, are also included in the service. The telephone company charges\nthe hotel rental for facilities and specified rates for local and toll\nmessages. Are such charges to be included in gross income by the telephone\ncompany?\nAnswer: Yes. (d) Utilities, which manufacture the products\nthey sell, frequently have residuals or by- products, resulting from the\nmanufacturing process, which are sold. Receipts from such sales are taxable if\nthe sales are for ultimate consumption or use by the purchaser in this State. Question 40: A gas company, as a by-product from the manufacture of gas, obtains tar, which it sells to a manufacturer of roofing supplies, who\nprocesses the tar and resells it. Are the receipts of the gas company from the\nsale of this by-product taxable?\nAnswer: No. The above sale is\nnot a sale for ultimate consumption, but is a sale for resale. Question 41: A gas company, as a result of the manufacture of gas, has a\nby- product of coke which it sells to householders for heating purposes. Are\nthe receipts from such sales taxable?\nAnswer: Yes. Question 42: If the gas company referred to in the preceding question\nsells the coke to a coal dealer, who in turn sells it to householders, are the\nreceipts of the gas company from such sales taxable?\nAnswer: No. Notes\nN.Y.
