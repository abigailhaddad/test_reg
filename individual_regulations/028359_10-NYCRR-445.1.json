  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 445.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n[4000]\n(a) The account distribution index serves as\na reference for proper classification of supplies and services\nexpenses. (b) [4100] The account\ndistribution index is divided into two sections. Section\n445.2\nof this Part, \"Job Titles by\n\nNatural Classification Index\", lists various job titles and the natural\nclassification of salaries and wages to which they must be charged as expenses. For example, the job title \"accountant\" requires that the salaries of an\naccountant must be charged to the natural classification.02 (Technician and\n\nSpecialist). (c) Section\n445.3\nof this Part, \"Supplies and\n\nServices by Natural Expense Classification Index\", lists various types of\nsupplies and services and the cost center and natural classification to which\nthey must be charged as expenses. In many cases, the cost center which\noriginally receives the supply items is not the cost center to which the supply\nexpense must be charged. For instance, although nonchargeable sutures may be\nreceived in the Central Service and Supply cost center and charged to\ninventory, upon requisition they are sent to an Operating Room cost center and\ntheir cost must be transferred interdepartmentally to that using cost center. It is this using cost center which is indicated in the Supplies and Services by\n\nNatural Expense Classification Index. All medical and surgical supplies and\nequipment expense related to patient chargeable items is to be charged to the\n\nMedical Supplies Sold cost center (account 7110), regardless of the cost center\nwhich actually issues the supplies. In order to have a matching of revenue and\nexpense, the revenue related to the patient-chargeable supplies is to be\ncredited to the Medical Supplies Sold revenue center (account 4110). All drug\nexpense related to patient-chargeable pharmacy items is to be charged to the\n\nDrugs Sold cost center (account 7150) regardless of the cost center which\nactually issues the item. The revenue related to the patient-chargeable item is\nto be credited to the Drugs Sold revenue center (account 4150). (d) Many of the items listed are not\nreferenced to a single cost center, but to the \"using\" or \"appropriate\" cost\ncenter. These are items commonly used in more than one cost center, whose cost\nmust be recorded directly or by interdepartmental transfer to the using cost\ncenter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n445.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
