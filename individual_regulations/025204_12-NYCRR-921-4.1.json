(b) An offer of reassignment to a different\nsite of employment shall not be deemed to be an offer of transfer if the new\njob otherwise constitutes a constructive discharge. (c) For purposes of this Part, reasonable\ncommuting distance is the distance an individual could be reasonably expected\nto commute to their job and is determined solely for purposes of transfers. Reasonable commuting distance will vary with local conditions with\nconsideration given to the geographic accessibility of the place of work, the\nquality of the roads, customarily available transportation, and the usual\ntravel time, provided however, in no event shall such distance exceed that\nwhich can be reasonably traveled in one and one-half hours when the site of\nemployment is being moved to a location within the City of New York or on Long\n\nIsland, or one hour when the site of employment is being moved to any other\nlocation in the state.
