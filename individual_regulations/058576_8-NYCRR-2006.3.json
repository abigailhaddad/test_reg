  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2006.3 - Procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Informal\ncompliance. If the president receives a complaint, or has other information\nwhich indicates that a violation of applicable laws, regulations, agreements or\nlimitations has occurred or is occurring, the president may informally call\nsuch matter to the attention of the institution involved and shall give such\ninstitution a reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegation and, if the\nalleged violation occurred, to show that it has been corrected or to submit an\nacceptable plan as to those measures which will be undertaken to correct the\nviolation and to prevent its recurrence. Undertaking informal compliance\nprocedures under this subdivision shall not prevent the president from\ninstituting limitation, suspension or termination proceedings or from imposing\nsanctions, based upon the same allegations or violations. (b) Formal sanctions. (1)\n\nIn the event that the president receives\nsufficient evidence of the violations set forth in section\n2006.5\nof this Part or determines\nthat there is a reasonable likelihood that an institution has violated any\nstatute, regulation, the terms of its participation agreement or the terms of\nany previous action taken pursuant to this Part, a limitation, suspension or\ntermination proceeding may be commenced. The institution of suspension\nproceedings or any suspension imposed shall not operate to waive the\ncorporation's right to take action based upon the violations found to exist, including but not limited to the taking of limitation or termination\nproceedings or the imposition of such sanctions. A limitation, suspension or\ntermination may be formally initiated whether or not the president has utilized\nthe informal compliance procedure. (2)\n\nThe president shall initiate limitation, suspension or termination procedures by mailing a notice to the institution in\nquestion, by certified mail with return receipt requested: (i) informing the institution of the\ncorporation's intent to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's continued\neligibility to participate in programs hereunder, the nature of any proposed\naction and the basis of such action; (ii)\nspecifying the proposed effective date\nfor the limitation, suspension or termination and the consequences of such\naction; and\n(iii)\ninforming the\ninstitution of its rights, if exercised within a stated period of time, to\nsubmit written material and to request a hearing before the limitation, suspension or termination takes effect. The notice shall also provide\ninformation pertaining to this proceeding as the president may determine to be\nappropriate. The notice shall also invite voluntary efforts to correct the\nviolation which led to the initiation of this action. (3)\n\nIf the institution requests a hearing\nwithin the time permitted, such hearing shall be conducted as promptly as\npossible by the presiding officer pursuant to the provisions of Part 2005 of\nthis Title. (4)\n\nIf the institution\ndoes not request a hearing, the president may, after considering any written\nmaterial submitted on a timely basis by the institution, dismiss the matter or\nnotify the institution that action has been taken and of the terms of such\naction. (c) Emergency\naction. Notwithstanding the notice and hearing procedures of this section, the\npresident may, without prior notice, take immediate action to suspend payments\nand prepayments of awards if he or she determines that such action is necessary\nin order to prevent or minimize an unreasonable risk of substantial loss or\nmisuse of funds provided pursuant to Subchapter C of this Title. Such emergency\naction shall be initiated by sending the institution notice, by certified mail, informing the institution of the suspension and the grounds therefor. Such\nemergency action shall not exceed seven days in length unless limitation, suspension or termination proceedings are initiated, pursuant to this Part, concurrently or within such seven-day period. If limitation, suspension or\ntermination proceedings are so commenced, the president will afford the\ninstitution an opportunity to demonstrate why the suspension should be\nrescinded during the pendency of such proceedings. (d) Effective date. Except as provided in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, the proposed effective date of limitation\nshall not be less than 21 days after the notice of intent has been sent. The\nperiod of time within which the institution may submit written material or\nrequest a hearing shall not be less than 15 days after such notice has been\nsent. If a hearing requested by the institution cannot reasonably be held prior\nto the proposed effective date of the limitation, the president may extend the\ndate of limitation until the completion of such proceedings. (e) Effect of prior proceedings. If any\nproceedings have been previously initiated under this Subchapter against an\ninstitution at the time limitation proceedings are initiated, such proceedings\nneed not duplicate the previous proceedings. Any matters resolved under the\nprevious proceedings shall be considered final and any hearings undertaken in\nthe subsequent limitation proceedings shall be limited to new evidence or new\nissues; provided, however, that the presiding officer may, in his or her\ndiscretion, agree to reconsider matters previously resolved. Moreover, the time\nschedules set forth in paragraphs (b)(2), (3) and (4) of this section may be\nshortened to reflect the previous proceedings in such manner as the presiding\nofficer may deem appropriate.
