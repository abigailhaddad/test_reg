Safety chain, when formed, fastened or rigged as on the vehicles, shall withstand load shown without breaking. Local marking, denting or gouging\nof the chain attaching means at the points of safety chain contact shall not be\nconsidered excessive distortion. The intent is that the chain attaching means\nshall have sufficient strength to break the safety chain consistently. ** \"Maximum GTW\" means the maximum gross trailer weight, pounds, which is to be towed.
