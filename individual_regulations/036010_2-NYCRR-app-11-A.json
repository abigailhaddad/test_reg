Codes R. & Regs. tit. 2, Appendices, app 11-A\nState Regulations\n\nClick to\nview image\n\nGentlemen: You have requested rulings concerning the Federal tax\nconsequences of pre-retirement death benefits payable to the beneficiaries of\ndeceased members under the laws pertaining to the New York State Employees'\nRetirement System and the New York State Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement\n\nSystem (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the System). Information available to this office discloses that the New\n\nYork State. Employees' Retirement System and the New York State Policemen's and\n\nFiremen's Retirement System are held to be qualified under section\n401(a)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code. The death benefits in question are authorized by the provisions\nof section 60, 60a 360 and 360a of the Retirement and Social Security Law and\nare wholly payable from employer contributions. The death benefits payable\npursuant to these sections of the Law are based on such variables as the date\nof original service, length of service, salary and age, and may be summarized\nas the larger of\n(a) three times salary to a maximum of $20,000, or\n(b) a percentum of final salary for each year of service, not\nto exceed 36, to a maximum of 3 years' salary, or\n(c) if the deceased was eligible to retire, the initial value\nof the pension reserve (modified or actual) that would have been payable had\nthe member retired on the date of his death. Member's contributions, if any, with interest are refunded to a\nbeneficiary as an incident to the death of a member but not as a death\nbenefit. -2-\nState of New York Department of Audit and Control\n\nThe New York State Public Employees Group Life Insurance Plan\nwas established on January 1, 1970, and provides group term life insurance to a\nmaximum of $50,000 of the ordinary death benefit. Such insurance coverage is\nwholly paid for by the employer. Your request is based on the following assumed facts\nillustrated by examples (A), (B) and (C) which utilize age 55 as a time for\neligibility for retirement and the above death benefit formulae (b) and (c). In\nsamples (B) and (C), the first $50,000 of the death benefit is group term life\ninsurance.

(You mention that\nexample A was presented merely to show the increase in benefits effected by\npoints in time after December 31, 1969.)\n-4-\nState of New York\n\nDepartment of Audit and Control\n\nYou also request confirmation that the term \"plan years\" as\nused in IRC 402(a)(5) means a fiscal year (i.e., our fiscal year April 1 to\n\nMarch 31) and that any limitation on capital gains would be for benefits\naccrued after March 31, 1970; also that Bryant v. U.S. (DC Md, CCH 1969 USTC S. 12, 636) excludes from estate tax any interest on member contributions. In addition, by letter dated July 6, 1970, you request rulings\nwith respect to the New York State Public Employees Group Life Insurance Plan\nas follows: 1. The group life insurance benefit, not to exceed $50,000, is\nexempt from Federal income tax pursuant to section 101(a)(1) of the\n\nCode; 2. The group life insurance benefit is subject to Federal\nestate tax pursuant to section 2042 of the Code; 3. Because the maximum insurance coverage is limited to\n$50,000, and because the contract is not purchased through either of the\nqualified pension plans administered by the State Comptroller, the cost of the\ninsurance coverage is not taxable to the employee as imputed income under\neither section 72 or 79 of the Code. With regard to the rulings requested in connection with the\ndeath benefits described in examples B and C of your first ruling request, we\nare assuming for the purpose of this ruling that any such death benefits will\nbe distributed of those entitled thereto as a total distribution payable within\nthe intendment of section 402(a)(2) of the Code. Section 402(a)(2) of the Code provides, in the case of an\nemployees' trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under\nsection 501(a), that if the total distributions payable with respect to any\nemployee are paid to the distributee within one taxable year of the distributee\non account of the employees death or other separation from the service, the\namount of such distribution, to the extent exceeding the amounts, if any, contributed by the employee (determined by applying section 72(f)), shall be\ntreated as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more\nthan six months. However, section 402(a)(5), which was added to the Code by\nsection\n515\nof the Tax Reform\n\nAct of 1969, P.L. 91-172, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., provides that such\ntreatment\n-5-\nState of New York\n\nDepartment of Audit and Control\nshall apply to a distribution paid after December 31, 1969, only to the extent that it does not exceed the sum of (A) the benefits accrued\nby the employee on behalf of whom it is paid during plan years beginning before\n\nJanuary 1, 1970, and (B) the portion of benefits accrued by such employee\nduring plan years beginning after December 31, 1969, which the distributee\nestablishes does not consist of the employee's allowable share of employer\ncontributions to the trust by which such distribution is made. Any such excess\nis taxable as provided in Code section 72(n) as amended by section\n515\nof the Tax Reform Act of 1969, Public\n\nLaw\n91-172, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. With respect to benefits paid on account of the death of a\nmember, section 101(b) provides in part that except for \"total distributions\npayable,\" which are paid within one taxable year of the distributee under a\nqualified plan, the $5,000 death benefit exclusion does not apply to amounts\nwith respect to which the deceased employee possessed immediately before his\ndeath, a nonforfeitable right to receive the amounts while living; nor does the\nexclusion apply to amounts received as an annuity under a joint and survivor\nannuity obligation where the employee was the primary annuitant and the annuity\nstarting date occurred before the death of the employee. While the death benefit exclusion under section 101(b)\nordinarily does not apply to amounts to which the deceased employee had a\nnonforfeitable right to receive while living, it will nevertheless, apply to\n\"total distributions payable\" under qualified plans even though the deceased\nemployee had a nonforfeitable right to receive the amounts while living. Furthermore, any amount found to be excludable as a death benefit shall, for\npurposes of section 72, be treated as additional consideration paid by the\nemployee. Section\n79(a)\nof\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides the general rule that there shall be\nincluded in the gross income of an employee for the taxable year an amount\nequal to the cost of group-term life insurance on his life provided for part or\nall of such year under a policy (or policies) carried directly or indirectly by\nhis employer (or employers); but only to the extent that such cost exceeds the\nsum of the cost of $50,000 of such insurance, and the amount (if any) paid by\nthe employee toward the purchase of such insurance. -6-\nState of New York\n\nDepartment of Audit and Control\n\nSection 1.79 -1(b)(1)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations\nprovides, in general, that group-term life insurance is term life insurance\nprotection provided under a master policy, or group of individual policies, which policy or policies, constitute life insurance contracts for purposes of\nsection 101(a) of the Code and form a part of a plan of group insurance as\ndefined in section 1.79 -1(b)(1)(iii) of the regulations. However, section 79\ndoes not apply to any amount of life insurance protection provided for an\nemployee by an employer which is in excess of the maximum amount of such\nprotection which could, under the law of the applicable jurisdiction, be\nprovided by such employer for such employee under a master policy providing\nonly group-term life insurance protection. Section 1.79 -1(b)(1)(iii)(b) of the regulations provides, in\npart, that to constitute a plan of group insurance, the plan must make term\nlife insurance available to a group of lives. Such group must include all of\nthe employees of the employer, or, subject to certain exceptions not pertinent\nhere, a class or classes of such employees the members of which are determined\non the basis of factors which preclude individual selection. Examples of such\nfactors are membership in a union whose members are employed by the employer, marital status, and age. In addition, section 1.79 -1(b)(1)(iii)(c) of the regulations\nprovides, in part, that to constitute a plan of group insurance, the amounts of\ninsurance protection provided under the plan must be based upon some formula\nwhich precludes individual selection of such amounts. Thus, for example, the\namounts of insurance on the lives of those individuals eligible for insurance\nunder the plan must be based on a factor such as salary, years of service or\nposition, or a combination of such factors. Therefore, with regard to ruling requests number 1 and 3 of\nyour letter dated July 6, 1970, we have concluded, based upon the information\npresented and provided the $50,000 of group-term life insurance coverage is not\nin excess of the maximum coverage permitted by section 1.79 -1(b)(1)(i) of the\nregulations, that the cost of the life insurance provided an employee under the\n\nNew York State Public Employee Group Life Insurance Plan will be excludable\nfrom the employee's gross income for Federal income tax purposes under section\n79 of the Code. Moreover, the proceeds of such insurance paid by reason of the\ndeath of such employee will be excludable from the gross income of the\nrecipient pursuant to the provisions of section 101(a)(1) of the Code. It is\nfurther concluded that the insurance coverage is not taxable to the employee as\nimputed income under section 72 of the Code. -7-\nState of New York\n\nDepartment of Audit and Control\n\nFurthermore, with respect to examples B and C in your letter of\n\nMarch 9, 1970, we have concluded that, if the amounts distributed in such cases\nin excess of the amount excludable under Code section 101(a)(1) as proceeds of\nlife insurance under the Group Life Insurance Plan, are distributed to the\ndistributee in a lump-sum, within one taxable year of the distributee, on\naccount of the employee's death, then the amount of such distribution to the\nextent exceeding (1) the amounts contributed by the employee into the System, including the amount, if any, considered to be contributed by the employee\nunder Code section 72(f)(2), plus (2) the amount excludable as a death benefit\nunder Code section 101(b), shall be treated as a long-term capital gain under\n\nCode section 402(a)(2), but only to the extent permitted by Code section\n402(a)(5), if applicable. Since the regulations under section 402(a)(5), which was added\nto the Code by the Tax Reform Act of 1969 have not yet been promulgated, we are\nunable to answer your question concerning the proration under such section of\nthe death benefit exclusion of section 101(b). However, if the regulations, when issued, do not provide a satisfactory answer to the problem, we will be\nglad at that time to give the matter further consideration if you so\ndesire. The term \"plan years\" as used in Code section 402(a)(5) is\ninterpreted to mean a taxable year of the trust which is a part of the plan. Accordingly, we conclude in this case that \"plan years\" would include a fiscal\nyear where the plan and trust so provide. In connection with your questions concerning the Federal estate\ntax consequences of the payment that consists of the decedent's contributions, interest accrued on these contributions, and a death benefit made to a person\nnominated by the decedent or his estate, it should be pointed out that the\n\nInternal Revenue Service does not issue rulings involving the prospective\napplication of the Federal estate tax. See section 3.02 of Revenue Procedure\n69-1, C.B. 1969-1, 381. Therefore, only general information can be\nfurnished. Section 2042 of the Code provides for the inclusion in a\ndecedent's gross estate of the proceeds of insurance on the decedent's life (a)\nreceivable by or for the benefit of the estate and (b) receivable by other\nbeneficiaries. It requires inclusion of the proceeds of insurance on the\ndecedent's life not receivable by or for the benefit of the estate if the\ndecedent possessed at the date of his death any of the incidents of ownership\nin the policy, exercisable either alone or in\n-8-\nState of New York\n\nDepartment of Audit and Control\nconjunction with any other person. Section 20.2042\n-\n1\n(c)(2)\nof the state Tax Regulations provides\nthat generally speaking the term \"incidents of ownership\" has reference to the\nright of the insured or his estate to the economic benefits of the policy and\nincludes among other things the power to change the beneficiary, to surrender\nor cancel the policy, to assign the policy, to revoke an assignment, to pledge\nthe policy for a loan, or to obtain from the insurer a loan against the\nsurrender value of the policy. Section\n2039(a)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code of 1954 provides that the entire value of an annuity or other\nbenefit payable to beneficiaries of the decedent or his estate is includible in\nhis gross estate. However, in the case of benefits distributed under a trust\nqualified under section 401(a), section 2039(c) provides, in effect, that the\nvalue of any benefits payable to any beneficiary, other than his estate, is\nincludible in the proportion thereof that the total payments or contributions\nmade by the decedent bears to the total contributions made, and for this\npurpose, contributions or payments bade by the decedent's employer shall not be\nconsidered to have been contributed by the decedent. The Service has always considered the accumulated interest on a\ndecedent's contributions to a qualified retirement plan as includible in the\ngross estate. This has been expressed in Rev. Rul. 56-1, C.B. 1956-1, 444, Commissioner\nv. Estate of Raymond W. Albright, 356 F. 2d\n319\n(2nd Cir. 1966), and Rev. Rul. 68-556, C.B. 1968-2, 408. Although we are unable to furnish you with a specific ruling\nfor Federal estate tax purposes we are considering publishing a Revenue Ruling\non the subject. Click to\nview image\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp.
