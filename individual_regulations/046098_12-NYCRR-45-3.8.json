(b) Slide construction. (1)\n\nThe sides of slides\nshall have all exposed edges reasonably smoothed and rounded away from the\nsliding surface. (2)\n\nSlides with\nserpentine runs where lanes are not parallel, or the lanes do not have a\nstarting and ending point in close proximity, shall be considered as individual\nslides. (c) End of\nslide. (1)\nA run-out area shall be provided\nat the end of a slide into which a rider enters upon completing a ride; this\narea shall be free of obstacles and obstructions. (2)\n\nRun-out space and/or reverse slope grade\nshall be designed to allow for gradual deceleration, and to minimize contact\nbetween sliding devices. (3)\n\nRoutine stopping of the sliding device shall not be dependent on collision or\nbumper devices. (4)\n\nThe run out\narea, and the end of the slide shall be kept free of non-patrons by the use of\nfences, gates and or suitable barricades. (d) Staging area. At the top of each slide an\narea shall be provided for patrons waiting to ride the slide. Means shall be\nprovided to control crowds in this area. (e) Starting zone. This zone shall begin at\nthe point of the slide where the patron gets into, or on to, the sliding\ndevice, in preparation for going down the incline. It shall continue down the\nincline of the snow slide to a point designated by the slide supervisor. (1)\n\nThe lower end of this zone shall be\nmarked. (2)\n\nNo other sliding\ndevices shall be allowed in this zone until it is clear of the previously\nstarted sliding devices. (3)\n\nThe\nzone shall be long enough to allow for the spacing of sliding devices in order\nto reduce the likelihood of collisions. (4)\n\nOn slides having multiple lanes, the\nprovisions of this subdivision shall apply to each lane individually. (f) Personnel. (1)\n\nSlide supervisor. The slide supervisor\nshall have the following duties: (i) overall\nresponsibility for the operation and maintenance of the snow slide; and\n(ii)\ntraining of the slide\nstarter and slide attendants in the duties and responsibilities of their\nassigned tasks. (2)\n\nSlide starter. The slide starter shall be positioned at the top of the snow\nslide and shall assure that once a sliding device(s) has started down a slide, the next sliding device(s) will not start its descent until the starting zone\nis clear. (3)\n\nSlide attendants. These attendants shall be in addition to those required by Code Rule 32 for the\noperation of ski lifts or tows used in conjunction with the slide. (i) Start of slide. At the start of the slide\nthere shall be at least one attendant whose function shall be to control the\nline of individuals waiting to use the slide. (ii)\n\nEnd of slide. At the end of the slide\nthere shall be at least one attendant who shall direct the riders to leave the\narea promptly with their sliding devices. (4)\n\nOne person may be designated to perform\nmultiple duties as required hereunder. (5)\n\nUnder all conditions each slide shall\nhave a slide starter at the top and one attendant at the bottom. (6)\n\nException. A slide may be operated with\nonly a starter at the top if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the slide starter has clear line of sight\nvision of the entire snow slide incline and run out area; (ii)\nno other sliding device shall be allowed\nto begin its descent until the track to the bottom is clear of other patrons, including those crossing over to an exit from other lanes; and\n(iii)\na means is provided to enable patrons\nat the bottom of the slope to receive instructions from the slide starter at\nthe top. (g) Sign instructions and rules of conduct. A large, well maintained sign, containing instructions and rules of conduct pertaining to the use of the\nslide, shall be conspicuously posted. (h) Communications. On slides where the\nstarter does not have clear line of sight to the attendant at the opposite end\nof the device, or the distance is impractical for the use of hand signals, other communication systems shall be provided between the slide starter and the\nattendants at the bottom of the incline. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n45-3.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
