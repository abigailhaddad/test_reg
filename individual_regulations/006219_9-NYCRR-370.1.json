  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 370.1 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The State\nof New York is abundant in natural, scenic and recreational resources. The\nmagnificent State park, recreational and historic site system, administered by\nthe Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation encourages and\nfacilitates the use and enjoyment of such resources by the public and thereby\npromotes and enhances the well-being of each individual. (b) State parks, however, contain waterfalls, waterways, chasms, slopes and other natural features which, by their nature, may constitute hazards and present dangers to persons approaching\nthem. (c) In addition to the\ndangers presented by natural hazards, the use of State parks and historic sites\nby the public for varied and divergent purposes may also, if not controlled, endanger the safety of members thereof and tend to deny certain individuals\nequality of opportunity in the use and enjoyment of these resources. (d) Therefore, to enhance and promote the\nsafety, well-being and enjoyment of each individual in the use of the State\npark, recreational and historic site system, and to assure to each individual\nequality of opportunity in the use and enjoyment of such system, the rules and\nregulations set forth in this Chapter are hereby established to govern the\nconduct of the public with respect thereto. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n370.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
