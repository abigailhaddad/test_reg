  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 82.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 475, 482-a, 483, 488\n(a) While it is recognized that agent, wholesale dealer, chain store and retail dealer activities are not mutually\nexclusive, the intent and the integrity of the cigarette marketing standards, in lieu of requiring accountability for all individual cigarette transactions\nmade within New York State, necessitate that substantially all of an agent's, CMSA wholesale dealer's, chain store's or CMSA retail dealer's cigarette\nactivities, be activities for which an agent, CMSA wholesale dealer, CMSA\nretail dealer, or chain store, respectively, is licensed or registered. That\nis, a person who wishes to purchase and/or sell cigarettes in this State\npursuant to any one section of this Part, shall not conduct secondary cigarette\nactivities in excess of 10 percent of such person's total cigarette activities. Such percentage is to be measured by the number of cartons of cigarettes sold\nin each calendar quarter. Accordingly: (1)\nsubstantially all (\ni.e., 90 percent or more) of such an\nagent's cigarette activities must pertain to unstamped packages of cigarettes\nupon which the agent affixes New York State cigarette tax stamps; (2)\nsubstantially all of such a CMSA\nwholesale dealer's cigarette activities must pertain to cigarettes sold for\npurposes of resale; (3)\nsubstantially all of such a chain store's cigarette activities must pertain to\ncigarettes sold at retail as described in section\n80.2\n(c) of this Title; and\n(4)\nsubstantially all of such a CMSA retail dealer's cigarette activities must\npertain to cigarettes sold to consumers. (b) A person, other than one purchasing\nand/or selling cigarettes pursuant to any one section of this Part in\naccordance with subdivision (a) of this section (\ni.e., exclusively as an agent, CMSA wholesale dealer, chain store or CMSA retail\ndealer), who wishes to purchase and/or sell cigarettes in this State in more\nthan one capacity, at a price which is less than the cost of the CMSA retail\ndealer (as defined in section\n82.5\nof this Part), may do so with the written consent of the Department of Taxation\nand Finance. Such person must separately account for all individual cigarette\ntransactions and, in determining such person's costs of doing business, must\nattribute specific costs to specific sales of cigarettes in each of the\ncapacities in which the person is eligible to conduct business. Such\nattribution must be to the satisfaction of the department. For example, a\nperson who qualifies as a CMSA wholesale dealer and who makes retail sales of\ncigarettes in excess of 10 percent may be permitted to purchase and/or sell\ncigarettes as both a CMSA wholesale dealer and a CMSA retail dealer, provided\nsuch person: (1)\ncan clearly account for its\nactivities in each capacity; (2)\ncan satisfactorily attribute costs to sales made in each capacity; (3)\ncomplies with the licensing provisions in\n\nPart 72 and the registration provisions in Part 73 of this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n82.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
