  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 442.2 - De-Escalation Rooms\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of this section, a\nde-escalation room means a room approved by the Office of Children and Family\n\nServices where a child may voluntarily be placed for clinical purposes when the\ncircumstances meet the needs identified in the child's support plan or\nindividualized crisis intervention plan. De-escalation rooms may only be used\nto assist in calming a child's escalating behavior. De-escalation rooms shall\nnot be used as a form of punishment or for the convenience of staff. An\ninstitution may use de-escalation room(s) only in accordance with the standards\nset forth in this section. The term de-escalation rooms, as used in this\nsection does not apply to therapeutic sensory rooms. (b) A child that is seriously depressed, has\na cognitive or developmental disability or has a seizure disorder shall never\nbe placed in deescalation rooms. (c) Use of de-escalation rooms must be\nvoluntary at the time the intervention is used and throughout its use. Voluntary means that any child being placed in a de-escalation room must agree\nto this intervention. Absent a risk/safety assessment and determination that\nthe child is in imminent danger of inflicting self-harm, harming another\nindividual,or the child's express request when such request is consistent with\nthe child's individualized crisis intervention plan, the duration of a child\nplaced in a de-escalation room shall not exceed two hours. (d) Any instance where a child remains in a\ndeescalation room for more than two hours in any 24-hour period, or is returned\nto a deescalation room two or more times during any seven-day period, must be\napproved by the director of the institution. In addition, the staff persons\ninvolved must discuss with their supervisors the events leading to the use of\nthe de-escalation room, the reasons the period was prolonged or used\nfrequently, and the child's continued request to be placed in the de-escalation\nroom, or the imminent concern leading to the extended stay. A summary of such\nsupervisory conference shall be recorded and kept in the child's case\nrecord. (e) Every effort shall be\nmade to return the child to the regular program of care as quickly as\npossible. (f) A staff person(s)\nshall maintain supervision and direct visual observation of the child for the\nduration the child is in the de-escalation room. (g) Each child in a de-escalation room shall\nhave access to bathroom and toilet facilities. In no instance shall a child be\nprohibited from receiving regular meals. (h) The agency's medical department must be\nalerted to each instance of placement of a child in a de-escalation room. Any\nchild in a de-escalation room for two or more hours must be assessed by either\na medical or mental health professional as soon as practicable upon exiting a\nde-escalation room, but no later than the next day if the instance occurred\nafter the close of business hours. (i) Each room used for de-escalation shall be\nheated, lighted, and ventilated as any other room in the facility and be\nlocated in a main program area, or within close proximity to a main program\narea. The de-escalation room is intended to be a soothing environment, and at a\nminimum, shall have: (1)\na door with an\nobservation window made of an unbreakable material that allows a total view of\nthe room; (2)\nno exposed electrical\noutlets; (3)\nconspicuous display\nof signage advising the child of their right to voluntarily enter and leave the\nde-escalation room at a time of their choosing; and. (4)\nfurniture that provides for a level of\ncomfort to aid in de-escalation, while also considering potential risks\nassociated with such furniture given that the nature of the room is to\nde-escalate children. Any room(s) used for de-escalation shall be inspected by\nthe department architect to determine if the wall construction is sufficient to\nwithstand attacks from a violent child. (j) The de-escalating room(s) must be\nunlocked, and the youth must have access to a bathroom. (k) Each use of the de-escalation room shall\nbe documented in the child's case record; and\n(i) Each authorized agency shall maintain\ndaily records of the number of children who are placed in de-escalation room(s). These records shall include the name and age of each such child, the reasons\nfor the use of the deescalation room, other methods of intervention that have\nbeen tried and proved unsuccessful and steps that will be taken to reduce the\ntime such child remains in a de-escalation room. This information shall be\nmaintained so that it is easily accessible and shall be made available to the\n\nOffice of Children and Family Services staff upon request. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
