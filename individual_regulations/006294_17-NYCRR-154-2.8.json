  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 §§ 154-2.8 - Safety-general\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe issuance of a divisible load overweight permit will\nbe guided by considerations for the safety of the traveling public and the\nprotection of the highways and the environment. (a) Accident reporting. Whenever a vehicle or\ncombinations of vehicles operating under a divisible load overweight permit is\ninvolved in an accident reportable under section\n605\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law, a copy of the report (MV 104) filed with the\n\nCommissioner of Motor Vehicles shall be submitted to the Advisory Council\nwithin 10 days of such accident. Reports shall be mailed to the Advisory\n\nCouncil, Department of Transportation, Building 5, Room 311, 1220 Washington\n\nAvenue, Albany, NY 12232. Failure to timely report such accidents may result in\nrevocation of the permit. (b) [Reserved]\n(c) Operation. (1)\n\nDivisible load overweight vehicles\noperating on four-lane or divided highways should be driven in the right-most\nlane of traffic, except where the right lane must exit. In the event that\nextremely slow traffic is encountered in the right-most lane, permit vehicles\nmay legally pass such traffic unless otherwise prohibited by regulatory sign. Vehicles operating on an incline and unable to maintain the posted speed limit\nshould pull off the highway whenever possible to allow traffic to pass. Permit\nvehicles shall be driven, as nearly as practicable, entirely within a single\nlane and shall not move from that lane unless such movement can safely be\nmade. (2)\n\nThe front or steering\naxle shall not carry more than 22,400 pounds. (3)\n\nPermit vehicles registered to the same\nowner(s) shall not travel in the same direction of travel closer than 1,000\nfeet apart unless specified on the permit. (4)\n\nLoads must be adequately secured to the\npermit vehicle to prevent shifting. (5)\n\nPermit movements during periods of high\nwinds, poor visibility, or when the highways are slippery due to snow, ice or\nrain should be restricted, based upon the necessity of the load reaching its\ndestination promptly. During such periods, such vehicles may be halted by any\npolice officer and ordered removed from the highway. (6)\n\nAll axles taken into consideration to\nestablish weight limitations must support a reasonable proportion of the load\nwhen the vehicle is laden. (7)\n\nThe\napplicant may be required to demonstrate to the department that the number of\naxles on the vehicle does not unduly hinder steering capacity so as to make\noperation of the vehicle unsafe. (8)\n\nThe applicant/permittee may have to\ndemonstrate that the steering capacity of the vehicle will not be unduly\nhindered if the vehicle maintains a bogey or air axle. (9)\n\nEach vehicle must be loaded so that the\ncenter of gravity of the laden vehicle will not cause the unsafe operation of\nthe vehicle. (10)\n\nNo permitted\nvehicle should be operated in excess of the manufactured-recommended gross\nweight rating (replacement vehicles only) or the weight rating(s) set forth in\nthe permit application for that vehicle. No permitted vehicle shall operate in\nexcess of the registered gross vehicle weight of that vehicle. Operation of\npermitted vehicles in excess of the above weights is considered to be per se\nunsafe. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§§\n154-2.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
