  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.557 - Upgrading to a pressure less than 125 psig (862 kpa)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unless the requirements of this section\nhave been met, no person may subject a segment of steel or plastic pipeline to\na higher maximum allowable operating pressure that is less than 125 psig (862\nkPa). (b) Increasing the maximum\nallowable operating pressure for cast iron, ductile iron, and wrought iron\npipeline segments is prohibited without prior approval. (c) Before increasing the operating pressure\nabove the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure, the\noperator shall comply with the following requirements: (1)\nreview the design, operating and\nmaintenance history of the segment of pipeline; (2)\nmake a leakage survey (if it has been\nmore than one year since the last survey) and repair any leaks that are\nfound; (3)\nmake any repairs, replacements or alterations in the segment of pipeline that are necessary for\nsafe operation at the increased pressure; (4)\nfor effectively coated steel systems, establish adequate cathodic protection in compliance with section\n255.463\nof this Part; (5)\nfor ineffectively coated or bare steel\nsystems, perform a review for active corrosion, isolate and cathodically\nprotect all coated segments and all services, and where active corrosion exists\nestablish adequate cathodic protection in compliance with section\n255.463\nof this Part; (6)\nreinforce or anchor offsets, bends and\ndead ends in pipe joined by compression couplings or bell and spigot joints to\nprevent failure of the pipe joint, if the offset, bend, or dead end is exposed\nin an excavation; (7)\nisolate the\nsegment of pipeline in which the pressure is to be increased from any adjacent\nsegment that will continue to be operated at a lower pressure; and\n(8)\nif the pressure in mains or service\nlines, or both, is to be higher than the pressure delivered to the customer, install a service regulator of adequate capacity on each service line and test\neach new or existing service regulator to verify that it is functioning\nproperly and adequately vented in compliance with sections\n255.355\n(b) and\n255.744\n(e) of\nthis Part. Pressure may be increased as necessary to test each regulator, after\na regulator has been installed on each pipeline subject to the increased\npressure. (d) After\ncomplying with subdivision (c) of this section, the increase in maximum\nallowable operating pressure must be made in increments that are equal to 10\npsig (69 kPa) or 25 percent of the total pressure increase, whichever produces\nthe fewer number of increments. Whenever the requirements of paragraph (c)(8)\nof this section apply, there must be at least two approximately equal\nincremental increases. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.557\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
