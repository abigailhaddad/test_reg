  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 418.2 - Mortgage loan servicer registration; exemptions\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection 590 (2)(b-1) of the Banking Law provides that no\nperson, partnership, association, corporation or other entity shall engage in\nthe business of servicing mortgage loans with respect to any property located\nin this State without first being registered with the superintendent as a\nmortgage loan servicer. A person servicing mortgage loans made under the Power\n\nNew York Act of 2011 (chapter 388 of the Laws of 2011) shall not thereby be\ndeemed to be engaged in the business of servicing mortgage loans. All\nservicers, including third-party servicers, engaged directly or indirectly in\nservicing mortgage loans, are required to register hereunder. When a mortgage\nloan servicer delegates servicing of one or more mortgage loans to another\nservicer without transferring ownership of the mortgage servicing rights, it\nremains obligated to comply with all requirements of this Part with respect to\nthe servicing of such loan mortgage loan(s). The sub-servicer likewise remains\nresponsible under this Part. The registration provisions of this Part shall not\napply to the following persons, provided that each such exempt person notifies\nthe superintendent that it is servicing mortgage loans in this State and\ncomplies with the regulations applicable to mortgage loan servicers (other than\nthose regarding registration): (a) Exempt organization. Any insurance company, banking organization, foreign\nbanking corporation licensed by the superintendent or the Comptroller of the\n\nCurrency to transact business in this State, national bank, Federal savings\nbank, Federal savings and loan association, Federal credit union, or any bank, trust company, savings bank, savings and loan association, or credit union\norganized under the laws of any other state, or any instrumentality created by\nthe United States or any state with the power to make mortgage\nloans. (b) Mortgage\nbanker. Any person licensed pursuant to section\n592\nof the Banking\n\nLaw to engage in the business of making mortgage loans. (c) Mortgage broker. Any person registered pursuant to section\n592-a\nof the\n\nBanking Law to engage in the business of soliciting, processing, placing or\nnegotiating mortgage loans for others, or offering to solicit, process, place\nor negotiate mortgage loans for others. (d) Assisting in incidental\nactivities. No person shall be subject to the registration provisions\nof this Part if he or she is employed by an exempt organization, a mortgage\nbanker or mortgage broker, or a mortgage loan servicer to assist in the\nservicing of mortgage loans for such employer. The preceding sentence shall not\naffect the obligation of any person to be licensed as a mortgage loan\noriginator when required under article 12-E of the Banking\n\nLaw. (e) Exemptions\napproved by the superintendent. Other persons may be exempted with the prior written\napproval of the superintendent for good cause. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
