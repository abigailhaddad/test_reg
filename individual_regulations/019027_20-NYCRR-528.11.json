  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.11 - Research and development\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1115(a)(10) and 1115(b)(ii)\n(a) Exemption. (1)\n\nThe sale of tangible personal property\npurchased for use or consumption directly and predominantly in research and\ndevelopment in the experimental or laboratory sense is exempt from the sales\nand use tax. (2)\n\nThe exemption does\nnot extend to installation and repair services for such property. (3)\n\nAn exemption is allowed for the sale of\ngas, electricity, refrigeration and steam, and gas, electric, refrigeration and\nsteam service of whatever nature for use or consumption directly or exclusively\nin research and development in the experimental or laboratory sense. (4)\n\nAn Exempt Use Certificate (form ST-121)\nis used to make purchases eligible for this exemption, without payment of sales\ntax. (See section\n532.4\n[e]\nof this Title.)\n(b) Research and development. (1)\n\nResearch and development, in the experimental or laboratory\nsense, means research which has as its ultimate goal: (i) basic research in a scientific or\ntechnical field of endeavor; (ii)\nadvancing the technology in a scientific or technical field of\nendeavor; (iii)\nthe development of\nnew products; (iv)\nthe improvement\nof existing products; and\n(v) the\ndevelopment of new uses for existing products. (2)\n\nResearch and development in the\nexperimental or laboratory sense does not include: (i) testing or inspection of materials or\nproducts for quality control (for machinery and equipment used for quality\ncontrol in the production of products for sale, see section\n528.13\nof this Part); (ii)\nefficiency\nsurveys; (iii)\nmanagement\nstudies; (iv)\nconsumer surveys, advertising and promotions; and\n(v) research in connection with literary, historical or similar projects. (c) Directly, predominantly, exclusively. (1)\n\nDirect use in research and development\nmeans actual use in the\nresearch and development operation. Tangible personal property for direct use\nwould broadly include materials worked on, and machinery, equipment and\nsupplies used to perform the actual research and development work. Usage in\nactivities collateral to the actual research and development process is not\ndeemed to be used directly in research and development. (2)\n\nTangible personal property is used\npredominantly in research and development if over 50 percent of the time it is\nused directly in such function. (3)\n\nTangible personal property is exempt only if it meets the tests of direct and\npredominant use. Example 1: Test tubes, flasks, reagents, microscopes and slides\npurchased by a chemical manufacturer for its research laboratory for developing\nnew pesticides are exempt from sales tax. Example 2: Laboratory tables for use in a research laboratory are\nexempt, but desks and chairs used by clerical personnel are not used directly\nin research. Example 3: A company constructs apparatus in its own machine shop, for\nuse only in its research department in experiments on the strength of different\nalloys. It purchases the materials from which the apparatus is constructed, and\nspecial tools and dies needed to construct the apparatus from its suppliers. The materials may be purchased without payment of tax, as directly and\npredominantly used in research. The special tools and dies are not exempt, as\nthey are not used directly and predominantly in research. Example 4: An aircraft manufacturer assembles two airplanes, which it\nuses for function and reliability tests prior to manufacturing this type of\nairplane for sale. The parts, equipment, instrumentation and fuel used on the\nairplanes during the testing phase are exempt as they are used directly and\npredominantly in research and development. Example 5: Technical books and journals purchased for a research and\ndevelopment laboratory, for use in doing background research are exempt. Example 6: Paper on which research and development test results are\nrecorded is exempt, but paper for in-house printing of a summary of research\nand development findings so that decisions may be made as to the marketability\nof the new products is taxable as the decisionmaking activity is\nadministrative. (4)\n(i) Gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam\nand gas, electric, refrigeration and steam service is used exclusively in\nresearch and development if 100 percent of its use is in such\nfunction. (ii)\n\nBecause gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam when purchased by the user is normally\nreceived in bulk or in a continuous flow and a portion thereof is used for\npurposes which would make the exemption inapplicable to such purchases, the\nuser may claim a refund or credit for the tax paid on the portion used or\nconsumed directly and exclusively in research and development. (iii)\n\nThe user must maintain adequate records\nwith respect to the allocation of gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam\nused directly and exclusively in research and development from that used for\nnonexempt purposes, the user must, when claiming a refund or credit, submit an\nengineering survey or the formulae used in arriving at the amounts used in an\nexempt manner. Example 7: A biological laboratory that develops new vaccines has an\nautoclave to sterilize instruments and a refrigerator for storage of the\nvaccine, both run by electricity. It receives one electric bill, which covers\ngeneral lighting and the electricity required for the autoclave and\nrefrigerator. It may obtain a refund of the portion of the tax applicable to\nthe charge for electricity required to run the autoclave and\nrefrigerator. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n528.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
