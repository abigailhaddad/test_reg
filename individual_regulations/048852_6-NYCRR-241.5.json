No asphalt based surface coating may be applied, sold, offered for\nsale, or manufactured if it contains more than 100 grams of VOC per\nliter. (b) VOC content\ndetermination. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, the VOC content of an asphalt based surface\ncoating must be determined through the use of the following equation: (Ws)\nVOC Content = ----------------------\n( Vm - Vw)\nwhere: VOC content = grams of VOC per liter of coating\n\nWs = weight of VOCs, in grams\n\nVm = volume of coating, in liters\n\nVw = volume of water, in liters\n\nThe VOC content of a tint base shall be determined prior to\nthe addition of the colorant. (2)\n\nAn alternative method may be used if\napproved by the department and the administrator. (3)\n\nThe department may additionally require\nthe manufacturer to conduct a 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, method 24 (see Table\n1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) analysis to\nverify the VOC content.

Each container must\ndisplay either the maximum or the actual VOC content of the coating, as\nsupplied, including the maximum thinning as recommended by the manufacturer. VOC content shall be displayed in grams of VOC per liter of coating. VOC\ncontent displayed shall be calculated using manufacturer's formulation data, or\nshall be determined according to subdivision (b) of this section. (2)\n\nBulk asphalt-based surface\ncoating recordkeeping. (i) Any person who\nsells or offers for sale any asphalt-based surface coating in quantities\ngreater than 10 gallons in size must provide to the purchaser, and the\ndepartment upon request, the following information regarding the coating: (a) the invoice sheet, bill of sale, or\nproduct manifest document; (b) the\nname of the supplier; (c) the name\nof the manufacturer; (d) the\nproduct name; (e) the VOC content; and\n(f) the material safety data\nsheet. (ii)\n\nAny person\nwho applies an asphalt-based surface coating from a container greater than 10\ngallons in size must have available for inspection by department staff the\ndocumentation described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph until the time\nthat all the relevant coating is applied or discarded.
