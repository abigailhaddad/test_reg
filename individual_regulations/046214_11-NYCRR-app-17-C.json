Regional conversion factors are used in the Workers' Compensation medical fee schedule to recognize differences in the cost of conducting a medical practice in various geographic regions of the State. Regional conversion factors were developed after a study was made by the chair of the Workers' Compensation Board. The components considered in the study made by the chair of the Workers' Compensation Board relative to the cost of conducting a medical practice generally apply to dentists, social workers, speech therapists and optometrists and, while there may be differences in some components, it has been determined by the superintendent that the percentage difference in relative cost by region applicable to physicians is also applicable to the cost of conducting a dental, social worker, speech therapy, optometric practice and by a thermographic technician. This determination will maintain consistency between the schedules established by the chair of the Workers' Compensation Board and specified schedules established by the superintendent under section 5108 of the New York Insurance Law. Regional conversion factors are listed in Parts A, C, D, I and L of this Appendix. For this purpose there are established four regions, based on the differences in the cost of maintaining various health provider practices in different localities of the State. The regions defined in Appendix 17-A of this Title, using United States Postal Service ZIP codes for the State of New York, are hereby adopted as being applicable to Parts A, C, D, I and L of this Appendix. The fee payable for care and treatment rendered by health care providers in accordance with Parts A, C, D, I and L of this Appendix shall be determined by the region in which the services were rendered. There are hereby established for each region the following regional conversion factors for the indicated Parts of this Appendix: REGIONAL CONVERSION FACTORS\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\nRegion IV\nA\n(Dental)\n$22.62\n$23.70\n$27.12\n$29.47\nC\n(Social workers)\n3.47\n3.64\n4.16\n4.52\nD\n(Therapy)\n6.22\n6.51\n7.45\n8.10\nI\n(Eye exams)\n15.89\n16.65\n19.05\n20.70\nL\n(Thermography)\n-Medical Doctor\n44.55\n46.67\n53.41\n58.04\n-Dentist\n44.55\n46.67\n53.41\n58.04\n-Chiropractic Doctor\n42.33\n44.35\n50.75\n55.14\n\nTo determine the maximum allowable fee for a procedure, it is necessary to multiply the unit value by the conversion factor. Example: If the dental procedure designated as procedure 02510 in the dental fee schedule is performed in Region II, the maximum allowable fee is determined by multiplying the unit value, 8.5, by 23.70, the dental conversion factor, i.e., 8.5 x 23.70 = 201.45.
