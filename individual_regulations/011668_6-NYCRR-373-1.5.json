(1)\n\nThe\npermit application consists of a completed part A application, the general\ninformation requirements of this section, and the specific information\nrequirements in subdivisions of this Subpart applicable to the facility. The\ninformation requirements presented in subdivisions (a)-(p) of this section\nreflect the standards in Subpart 373-2 of this Part. These information\nrequirements are necessary in order for the department to determine compliance\nwith the Subpart 373-2 standards. If the owner and operator of a hazardous\nwaste management facility can demonstrate, to the department's satisfaction, that the information prescribed in this paragraph, other than in the Part A\napplication, cannot be provided to the extent required, the department may make\nallowance for submission of such information on a case-by-case basis. However, such submission must be sufficient to allow the department to determine\ncompliance with the Subpart 373-2 standards. Information requirements in this\nsection must be submitted to the department and signed in accordance with\nrequirements in section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart. Certain technical data, such as design drawings and\nspecifications, and engineering studies and reports must be certified by a\nprofessional engineer registered in New York State. The location of property\nboundaries must be certified by a person or firm registered to practice land\nsurveying in the State of New York. For post-closure permits, the information\nspecified in subdivision (o) of this section is required in the permit\napplication. (2)\n\nGeneral\ninformation requirements. The following information is required for all HWM\nfacilities: (i) A general description of the\nfacility.

Include, where applicable, as part of the contingency plan, specific requirements in\nsection\n373-2.11\n(e) of\nthis Part. (viii)\nA description of\nprocedures, structures or equipment used at the facility to: (a) prevent hazards in loading and unloading\noperations. Physical hazards may be minimized, for example, by using ramps and\nspecial forklifts. Procedures and equipment used to prevent or contain spills\nmust take into account the pressure and volume of the transfer lines, and the\ntime needed for an operator to respond to a spill (\ne.g., failure of a transfer line or connection point); (b) prevent runoff from hazardous waste\nhandling areas to other areas of the facility or environment, or to prevent\nflooding (for example, berms, dikes, trenches); (c) prevent contamination of water\nsupplies; (d) mitigate effects of\nequipment failure and power outages; (e) prevent undue exposure of personnel to\nhazardous waste (for example, protective clothing); and\n(f) prevent releases to the\natmosphere.

(x) Traffic pattern, estimated volume (number, types of vehicles) and control (for example, show\nturns across traffic lanes, and stacking lanes, if appropriate; describe access\nroad surfacing and load-bearing capacity; show traffic control\nsignals). (xi)\n\nFacility location\ninformation. (a) Owners and operators of all\nfacilities must provide an identification of whether the facility is located\nwithin a 100-year flood plain. This identification must indicate the source of\ndata for such determination and include a copy of the relevant Federal\n\nInsurance Administration (FIA) flood map, if used, or the calculations and maps\nused where an FIA map is not available. Information shall also be provided\nidentifying the 100-year flood level and any other special flooding factors\n(\ne.g., wave action) which must be considered in designing, constructing, operating or maintaining the facility to withstand washout from a\n100-year flood. Comment: Where maps for the National Flood Insurance program\nproduced by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency\n\nManagement Agency are available, they will normally determine if a facility is\nlocated within or outside of the 100-year flood plain. However, where the FIA\nmap excludes an area (usually areas of the flood plain less than 200 feet in\nwidth), these areas must be considered and a determination made as to whether\nthey are in the 100-year flood plain. Where FIA maps are not available for a\nproposed facility location, the owner or operator must use equivalent mapping\ntechniques, approved by the commissioner, to determine whether the facility is\nwithin the 100-year flood plain and, if so located, what the 100-year flood\nelevation would be. (b) Owners and operators of facilities located in the 100-year flood plain must\nprovide the following information: (1)\nengineering analysis to indicate the various hydrodynamic and hydrostatic\nforces expected to result at the site as a consequence of a 100-year\nflood; (2)\nstructural or other\nengineering studies showing the design of operational units\n(\ne.g., tanks, incinerators) and flood protection devices\n(\ne.g., floodwalls, dikes) at the facility, and how these will\nprevent washout; (3)\nif applicable, and in lieu of subclauses (\n1\n) and (\n2\n) of this\nclause, a detailed description of procedures to be followed to remove hazardous\nwaste to safety before the facility is flooded, including: (i) timing of such movement relative to flood\nlevels, including estimated time to move the waste, to show that such movement\ncan be completed before floodwaters reach the facility; (ii)\na description of the location(s) to\nwhich the waste will be moved and demonstration that those facilities will be\neligible to receive hazardous waste in accordance with the regulations under\nthis Part or, if the facility is not located in New York State, in accordance\nwith applicable regulations of the state in which the facility is\nlocated; (iii)\nthe planned\nprocedures, equipment and personnel to be used and the means to ensure that\nsuch resources will be available in time for use; and\n(iv)\nthe potential for accidental discharges\nof the waste during movement. (c) Existing facilities not in compliance\nwith section\n373-2.2\n(j) of this\n\nPart must provide a plan showing how the facility will be brought into\ncompliance and a schedule for compliance.
