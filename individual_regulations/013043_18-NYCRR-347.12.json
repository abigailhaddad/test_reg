(b) In any case in which\nsupport is collected for a recipient of public assistance with respect to whom\nan assignment of support rights under section 369.2 or\n370.2\nof this Title is effective, and where arrears are due to the family pursuant to section\n347.13\nof this Part, such\ncollections on those arrears shall be distributed and disbursed directly to the\nfamily. (c) An amount which\nrepresents the required monthly support obligation for one month, or the cash\nmedical support obligation for one month in a medical assistance-only case, must be determined from the order of support. If the order of support is set\nout in a frequency other than monthly, it must be converted to an amount which\nrepresents the required monthly support obligation. (d) Any amount collected in a month which\nexceeds the required monthly support obligation or the cash medical support\nobligation determined pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section represents a\ncollection towards the required monthly support obligation or cash medical\nsupport obligation for past months. (e) As soon as possible, but not later than\n10 business days after the end of a month, the support collection unit will\ninform the public assistance unit, the medical-assistance unit and foster care\nunit of the social services district of the amount of the collection which\nrepresents payment on the required monthly support obligation for that month, or the cash medical support obligation for that month in a medical\nassistance-only case, and for past months as determined pursuant to section\n347.13\nof this Part. (f) When the public assistance unit is\ninformed of the amount pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section, the public\nassistance unit must determine pursuant to section\n352.31\n(a)(6)\nof\nthis Title if the amount collected will affect the family's eligibility for\npublic assistance payments. If the amount collected represents payment on the\nrequired monthly support obligation for that month and is sufficient to make\nthe family ineligible for a public assistance payment pursuant to this Title, the public assistance unit must notify the support collection unit of such\nfact, except in those cases pursuant to Part 358 of this Title in which a\nfamily is nevertheless entitled to a public assistance payment pending the\nresult of a hearing. (g) Upon\nnotice from the public assistance unit that the family is no longer eligible\nfor public assistance pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, or upon\nnotice from the medical assistance or foster care units that the family is no\nlonger in receipt of medical assistance or that foster care maintenance\npayments have terminated, the support collection unit must notify the family\npursuant to section\n347.17\nof this Part that the\nsupport collection unit will continue to distribute and disburse collections\nreceived pursuant to section\n347.13\nof this Part. (h) Where the entire amount of support\ncollected is distributed and disbursed to the social services district pursuant\nto subdivision (a) of this section and that disbursement exceeds the cumulative\namount that the family actually received as public assistance, such excess\nshall be paid to the family pursuant to section\n352.15\n(c) of this\n\nTitle.
