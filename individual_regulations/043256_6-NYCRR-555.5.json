  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 555.5 - Plugging methods, procedures and reports\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The plugging of a well shall be conducted\nin accordance with the following sequence of operations: (1)\n\nThe well bore, whether to remain cased or\nuncased, shall be filled with cement from total depth to at least 15 feet above\nthe top of the shallowest formation from which the production of oil or gas has\never been obtained in the vicinity. Alternatively, a bridge topped with at\nleast 15 feet of cement shall be placed immediately above each formation from\nwhich the production of oil or gas has ever been obtained in the\nvicinity. (2)\n\nIf any casing is to\nbe left in the ground, a cement plug of at least 15 feet in length shall be\nplaced at the bottom of such section of casing. A similar plug shall be placed\nat the top of such section of casing unless it shall extend to the surface. In\nthe latter event, the casing shall be capped in any such manner as will prevent\nthe migration of fluids and not interfere with normal soil\ncultivation. (3)\n\nIf casing\nextending below the deepest potable fresh water level shall not remain in the\nground, a cement plug of at least 15 feet in length shall be placed in the open\nhole at a position approximately 50 feet below the deepest potable fresh water\nlevel. (4)\n\nIf the conductor or\nsurface casing is drawn, a cement plug of at least 15 feet in length shall be\nplaced immediately below the point where the lower end of the conductor or\nsurface casing shall previously have rested. The hole thereabove then shall be\nfilled with cement, sand or rock sediment or other suitable material in such a\nmanner as will prevent erosion of the well bore area and not interfere with\nnormal soil cultivation. (5)\n\nThe\ninterval between all plugs mentioned in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this\nsubdivision shall be filled with a heavy mud-laden or other approved\nfluid. (6)\n\nThe operator shall have\nthe option as to the method of placing any cement in the hole by either (i)\ndump bailer, (ii) pumping or siphoning through tubing or drill pipe, (iii) pump\nand plug, or (iv) such other method as shall be approved by the\ndepartment. (b) In the\nevent mechanical or other unusual conditions in the well are such as to make\nplugging following the sequence outlined in subdivision (a) of this section\nimpractical, the owner or operator may be granted permission by the department\nto use some alternative or equivalent plugging procedure. (c) As a part of the plugging and abandonment\noperation, the owner or operator shall fill with earth any pit or other\nexcavation, including any rat hole or mouse hole, which has been created to\nfacilitate the drilling or production of the well. In addition, a reasonable\neffort to smooth the surface adjacent to the well and filled pit or excavation\nso as to place the surface in a condition similar to the adjacent terrain and\nwithout undue elevation shall be made. If it can be demonstrated to the\nsatisfaction of the department that no hazard will result and the landowner has\nsigned an appropriate release, these surface restoration requirements will be\nwaived. (d) Within 30 days after\nthe plugging of any well, a plugging report on form OG13 shall be filed with\nthe department by the owner or operator or person responsible for the plugging\noperation.
