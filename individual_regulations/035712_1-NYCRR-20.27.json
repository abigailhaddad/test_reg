(3)\n\nThe market administrator finds on the\nbasis of available information that the handler operating a plant or unit or\nthe cooperative reporting a plant or unit is not utilizing milk received from\nproducers in accordance with the minimum percentage set forth in the\ndetermination of the market administrator previously announced pursuant to\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision: provided, that the suspension of the\ndesignation of a plant or unit may be made effective during the months of\n\nNovember and December if the market administrator finds that the handler is\nutilizing any milk received from producers in classes other than those set\nforth in the determination of the market administrator announced pursuant to\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (i) The cancellation of pool plant or pool\nunit designation for failure to meet the requirements of section\n20.26\n(a) of this\n\nPart shall be subject to the following conditions: (1)\n\nNo pool plant or pool unit designation\nshall be canceled if the handler operating the plant or unit utilized the milk\nreceived by the handler from producers during the month in which the suspension\nis made effective in accordance with the minimum percentage set forth in the\ndetermination of the market administrator announced pursuant to paragraph\n(h)(2) or subdivision (1) of this section. (2)\n\nNo pool plant or pool unit designation\nshall be canceled if the handler operating the plant or unit utilized in the\nspecified classes set forth in the determination of the market administrator\nannounced pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section a percentage of the\ntotal milk received by such handler from producers during the month in which\nthe suspension is made effective which is not less than the percentage of the\ntotal pool milk reported by all handlers for such month to have been used in\nthe specified classes. (3)\n\nIn the\nevent that all milk received from producers at a plant or unit is reported to\nthe market administrator by a cooperative association qualified pursuant to\nsection\n20.77\nof this Part and such\nassociation pays the producer for such milk, the pool plant or pool unit\ndesignation shall not be canceled if a percentage of all milk reported by such\ncooperative association is utilized in accordance with the minimum percentage\nset forth in the determination of the market administrator announced pursuant\nto paragraph (h)(2) of this section, or in accordance with the percentage set\nforth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nCancellation of designations shall be\nlimited to those plants or units necessary to result in a utilization of milk\nreceived at the remaining pool plants and pool units operated by the handler, or reported by the cooperative, as the case may be, in accordance with the\nminimum percentage set forth in subdivision (1) of this section, or in the\ndetermination of the market administrator announced pursuant to paragraph\n(h)(2) of this section. (j) Loss of approval by health authorities of\na plant as a source of milk for the marketing area may in itself constitute\nadequate reason for the market administrator to suspend the designation of the\nplant for failure to meet the requirements of section\n20.26\n(b) of this\n\nPart only if the absence of such approval continues for more than 15\ndays. (k) The designation shall be\ncanceled effective on the first of the month following three consecutive months\nin in the absence of this designation milk received from dairy farmers and\nunits at the plant would have been classified and priced under another order\nwith a provision for marketwide equalization and if in each of such months the\npercentage of milk received from dairy farmers and units at the plant which is\nclassified as Class I-A and disposed of in the marketing area defined in such\nother order is greater than the percentage of such milk so classified and\ndisposed of in this marketing area.
