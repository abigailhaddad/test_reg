  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5322.2 - Gaming chips; physical characteristics, issuance and use\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Physical characteristics applicable to\nall chips; issuance and use. (1)\n\nEach chip\nshall be in the form of a disk and, except as otherwise provided in this Part, shall have a uniform diameter of one and 9/16\nths\ninches, or the metric equivalent, for each chip in a denomination of less than\n$500. Each chip in a denomination of $500 or more shall have a uniform diameter\nof one and 11/16\nth\ninches, or the metric\nequivalent. (2)\n\nNo chip shall be\nused in a gaming facility unless and until the design specifications of the\nproposed chip are, prior to the manufacture of the chip, submitted to and\napproved in writing by the commission, which submission shall include a\ndetailed schematic depicting the actual size and, as appropriate, location of\nthe following: (i) each face, including any\nindentations or impressions; (ii)\nthe edge; and\n(iii)\nany colors, words, designs, graphics or security measures contained on or in the\nchip. (3)\n\nEach chip\nissued by the gaming facility shall be designed and manufactured with\nsufficient graphics or other security measures to the greatest extent possible, to prevent the counterfeiting of the chip. (b) Value chips; denominations; physical\ncharacteristics. (1)\nA gaming facility shall\nbe authorized to issue and use value chips in denominations of $1, $2, $2.50, $5, $10, $20, $25, $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, $25,000 and\n$100,000 and other denominations approved in writing by the\ncommission. (2)\n\nEach monetary\ndenomination of value chip issued by the gaming facility shall contain a\npredominant color unique to that denomination, to be known as the primary\ncolor, as set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. A secondary color on\na value chip is any color, other than that such chip's primary color, included\non the face or edge of the chip as a contrast to such chip's primary color, except that no primary color shall be used as a secondary color on a value chip\nof another denomination where such use on the edge is reasonably likely to\ncause confusion as to the chip's denomination when the edge alone is\nvisible. (3)\nA value chip shall\nappear as the color set forth in this paragraph when such chip is viewed both\nin daylight and under incandescent light. In conjunction with the primary\ncolors, the gaming facility shall use contrasting secondary colors for the edge\nspots on each denomination of value chip. The primary color that the gaming\nfacility shall use for each denomination of value chip shall be as follows: Denomination\n\nColor\n$1\n\nWhite\n$2\n\nLight blue\n$2.50\n\nPink\n$5\n\nRed\n$10\n\nBlue\n$20\n\nYellow\n$25\n\nGreen\n$100\n\nBlack\n$500\n\nPurple\n$1,000\n\nOrange\n$5,000\n\nGray\n$10,000\n\nBrown\n$20,000\n\nGold\n$25,000\n\nFluorescent radiant red\n$100,000\n\nMetallic gold\n(4)\n\nEach value chip issued by a gaming\nfacility shall contain certain identifying characteristics that may appear in\nany location at least once on each face of the chip and are applied in a manner\nthat ensures that each such characteristic shall be visible clearly and remain\na permanent part of the chip. These characteristics shall, at a minimum, include: (i) the monetary denomination of the\nvalue chip, expressed in numbers; (ii)\nthe name, logo or other approved\nidentification of the gaming facility issuing the value chip, which shall be\napplied in such a manner so as to be visible to the gaming facility's\nsurveillance department using the closed-circuit television system; and\n(iii)\nthe primary color of the\nvalue chip. (5)\n\nIn\naddition to the characteristics specified in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, each value chip in a denomination of $25 or more shall contain a design or\nother identifying characteristic that is unique to the manufacturer of the\nchip. (6)\n\nEach value chip issued by\nthe gaming facility shall contain an identifying characteristic, to be known as\nan edge spot, which shall: (i) be applied in\na manner that ensures that the edge spot shall be clearly visible on the edge\nand on each face of the value chip and remain a permanent part of the value\nchip; and\n(ii)\nbe created by using: (a) the primary color of the chip; (b) one or more secondary colors; and\n(c) a design, pattern or other\nfeature that a person with adequate training readily could use to identify, when viewed through a closed-circuit television system, the denomination of the\nparticular value chip when placed in a stack of chips, in the table inventory\nor in any other location where only the edge of the value chip is visible; provided, however, that the design, pattern or feature created by the primary\nand secondary colors shall be sufficient by itself to satisfy the requirements\nof this subdivision if approved in writing for that purpose by the\ncommission. (7)\n\nEach value chip with a denomination less\nthan $25 shall contain at least one anti-counterfeiting measure and each value\nchip with a denomination of $25 or more shall contain at least three\nanti-counterfeiting measures in addition to those items required to appear on\nthe face or edge of a value chip by this section. Each value chip with a\ndenomination of $25,000 or more shall contain at least four anti-counterfeiting\nmeasures in addition to those items required to appear on the face or edge of a\nvalue chip by this section. (8)\n\nIn\naddition to any other requirement imposed by the commission and this section, the edge spots on a value chip that has non-identical faces shall appear\nuniform in design, pattern or other feature when viewed from the perspective of\nthe same face on any other value chip in the set. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, the edge spots on a value chip that has non-identical faces and a\ndenomination below $25 may appear uniform in design, pattern or other feature\nor as an inverted mirror image thereof when viewed from the perspective of\neither face on any other value chip in the set. (c) Non-value chips; physical\ncharacteristics, permitted uses, inventory and impressment. (1)\n\nEach non-value chip shall be used only in\ngames authorized by the commission. (2)\n\nEach non-value chip issued by the gaming\nfacility shall contain certain identifying characteristics that may appear in\nany location at least once on each face of the chip and shall be applied in a\nmanner that ensures that each such characteristic shall be clearly visible and\nremain a permanent part of the chip. The characteristics required by\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph shall be applied in such a manner\nso as to be visible to the gaming facility's surveillance department using the\ngaming facility's closed-circuit television system. The identifying\ncharacteristics of a non-value chip, at a minimum, shall include: (i) the name, logo or other approved\nidentification of the gaming facility issuing the non-value chip; (ii)\na design, insert or symbol that will\npermit a set of non-value chips being used at a particular gaming table to be\ndistinguished readily from the non-value chips being used at every other gaming\ntable in the gaming facility; (iii)\nthe name of the game; and\n(iv)\nsuch\ncolor and design combinations as approved by the commission so as to\ndistinguish readily the non-value chips of each player at a particular gaming\ntable from the non-value chips of every other player at the same gaming table\nand the value chips issued by the gaming facility. (3)\n\nEach non-value chip issued by the gaming\nfacility shall contain an identifying characteristic, to be known as an edge\nspot, that shall: (i) be applied in a manner\nthat ensures that the edge spot shall be clearly visible on the edge and on\neach face of the non-value chip and remain a permanent part of the non-value\nchip; (ii)\nbe created by using the\ncolors approved by the commission for the face of the particular non-value\nchip, in combination with one or more other colors that provide a contrast with\nthe color on the face of the chip; and\n(iii)\ninclude a design, pattern or other\nfeature approved in writing by the commission that a person with adequate\ntraining readily could use to identify, when viewing the non-value chip through\na closed-circuit television system, the player to whom the non-value chip has\nbeen assigned when the non-value chip is placed in a stack of chips or in any\nother location where only the edge of the non-value chip is visible; provided, however, that the design, pattern or feature created by the colors required by\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision shall be sufficient by itself to satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision if approved in writing for that purpose by the\ncommission. (4)\n\nEach\nnon-value chip shall be assigned to a particular gaming table and shall be\nissued and used for gaming at that table only. All non-value chips used at a\nparticular gaming table shall have the same design, insert or symbol. Neither\nthe gaming facility nor any employee thereof shall knowingly allow any patron\nto remove a non-value chip from the table at which it was issued. (5)\n\nAn impressment of the non-value chips\nassigned to each gaming table shall be completed at least once every 30 days. The gaming facility shall record the results of the impressment in a chip\ninventory ledger and shall perform the impressment in accordance with the\nsystem of internal controls as set forth section\n5313.1\nof this\nsubchapter. (6)\n\nThe gaming facility\nshall record in a chip inventory ledger and submit to the commission, a monthly\nsummary of the non-value chip inventory for each gaming table. This monthly\nsummary shall include, at a minimum, the following information for each\nnon-value chip color, design and other identifiers: (i) the number of non-value chips received\nfrom the manufacturer during the month; (ii)\nthe balance on hand at the beginning of\nthe month; (iii)\nthe number of\nnon-value chips distributed to each roulette table during the month; (iv)\nthe number of non-value chips returned\nto inventory during the month; and\n(v) the balance on hand at the end of the\nmonth. (d) A\ngaming facility licensee may issue promotional chips only to be used in\npromotions as approved by the commission. The physical characteristics of such\nchips shall be sufficiently distinguishable from the approved design\nspecifications of any gaming value or non-value chip issued by the gaming\nfacility licensee so as reasonably to ensure that such promotional chip will\nnot be confused with authorized chips. At a minimum, such promotional chips\nshall: (1)\nbe unique in terms of size, weight\nand color; (2)\nhave no edge designs\nunique to chips; (3)\nbear the name\nof the gaming facility issuing them and the phrase \"No Cash Value\" on both\nfaces; and\n(4)\nshall include the\nletters \"NY\" and the name of the city or county in which the gaming facility is\nlocated. (e) A gaming\nfacility licensee may issue promotional non-chips that are prohibited from use\nin gaming. The physical characteristics of such non-value chips shall be\nsufficiently distinguishable from approved design specifications of any gaming\nvalue or non-value chip issued by the gaming facility licensee so as reasonably\nto ensure that such promotional non-chips will not be confused with authorized\nchips. At a minimum, such promotional non-chips shall: (1)\nbe unique in terms of size, weight and\ncolor; (2)\nhave no edge designs\nunique to chips; (3)\nbear the name\nof the gaming facility issuing them and language on both faces stating that\nthey have no redeemable value; and\n(4)\nshall include the letters \"NY\" and the\nname of the city or county in which the gaming facility is located. (f) A gaming facility may use RFID\nchips. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
