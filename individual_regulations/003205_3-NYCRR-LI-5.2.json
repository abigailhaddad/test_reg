  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 5.2 - Manner of holder bearer securities\n\nState Regulations\nA credit union inquired whether securities in which it could\nlegally invest but which were available only in bearer form could be held in an\naccount with a broker who in turn would place them in the broker's own name in\na custody account with a commercial bank in this State, but with a designation\nthat they were the property of the credit union. Subdivision 14 of section\n453\nof the Banking\n\nLaw, pertaining to securities in which a credit union may invest, provides with\nexceptions not here relevant that such securities if non-registrable \"shall be\nplaced in the custody of a bank or trust company or a national bank located in\nthis State, in the name of the credit union________\"\nThe department replied that the arrangement described would\nnot be in compliance with law. As a technical matter the securities would be\nheld by the bank in the name of the broker, not of the credit union as required\nby statute. As a matter of substance, the fact that there was some form of\ndesignation regarding the credit union's ownership would not give the credit\nunion the same control over the securities as it would have if the account were\nin its own name. In addition, the placement of a broker in the chain of\nownership, however nominal its interest may appear to be, adds a degree of risk\nto the liquidity of, and clarity of ultimate title to the investment securities\nconcerned. DATED: November 26, 1973\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 5.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
