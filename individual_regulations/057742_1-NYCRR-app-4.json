MANUAL DIVERSION\n(when booster pump is\ninstalled in the HTST system)\n\nApparatus. -None. Method. -Observe the response of the system to\nmanual diversion. Procedure. -With the HTST system in operation and\nthe flow-diversion device in the forward-flow position, press the manual\ndiversion button. This should (a) cause the valve to assume the divert\nposition, and (b) de-energize the booster pump; the pressure differential\nbetween raw and pasteurized milk in the regenerator should be\nmaintained. Corrective Action. -If (a) and (b) above do not\noccur as described or the necessary pressure differential between raw and\npasteurized milk is not maintained, the assembly and wiring of the HTST system\nmust be immediately reviewed and the indicated deficiencies corrected. 6. RESPONSE TIME\nApparatus. -Stopwatch. The stopwatch should be used\nto determine that the response time interval does not exceed 1 second. Method. -Determine the elapsed time between the\ninstant of the activation of the control mechanism at cut-out temperature on\ndeclining temperature and the instant the flow-diversion device takes the fully\ndiverted-flow position. Procedure. -a. With water or oil bath at a\ntemperature above cut-out temperature, allow the water or oil to cool\ngradually.

The device immediately moves to the diverted-flow position\nand the metering pump is turned off. b. The device remains in the diverted-flow position while the\nmetering pump is running down. c. After the metering pump stops turning, the device assumes\nthe forward-flow position. d. Repeat the above procedure by moving the control switch to\nthe cleaned-in-place (CIP) position. e. Record test results and seal the control enclosure. Corrective action. -If the above sequence of\nevents does not occur, either a timer adjustment or wiring change is\nrequired. TEST 6.

TEST 7. INDICATING THERMOMETERS ON PIPELINES-THERMOMETRIC\nRESPONSE\nReference.-Item 16p(D). Application. -To all indicating thermometers\nlocated on pipelines and used for determination of milk temperatures during\npasteurization. Frequency. -Upon installation and once each 3\nmonths thereafter. Criteria. -Four seconds under specified\nconditions. Apparatus. -Test thermometer, stopwatch, water bath\n(10-gallon can), agitator, heat supply, and indicating thermometer from\npasteurizer. Method. -By measuring the time required for the\nreading of the thermometer being tested to increase 12°F (7°C) through a\nspecified temperature range (temperature range must include pasteurization\ntemperature). The temperature used in the water or oil bath will depend upon\nthe scale range of the thermometer to be tested. Procedure. -1. Immerse indicating thermometer in\nwater or oil bath heated to a temperature at least 19°F (11°C) higher than\nminimum scale reading on indicating thermometer. Bath temperature should be\nhigher than maximum pasteurization temperature for which thermometer is\nused. 2. Immerse indicating thermometer in bucket of cold water for\nseveral seconds to cool it. Note.-Continuous agitation of water baths during the\nperformance of steps 3, 4, and 5 is required. Elapsed time between end of step\n1, and beginning of step 3 should not exceed 15 seconds so hot water bath does\nnot cool significantly. 3. Insert indicating thermometer in hot water or oil bath to\nproper bulb immersion depth. 4. Start stopwatch when indicating thermometer reads 19°F\n(11°C) below bath temperature. 5. Stop stopwatch when indicating thermometer reads 7°F (4°C)\nbelow bath temperature. 6. Record thermometric response time for office record. Example. -On a thermometer with a range of\n150°F to 175°F (66°C to 80°C) used at pasteurization temperatures of 161°F and\n166°F (72°C and 75°C), a water bath of 170°F (77°C) could be used. 19°F (11°C)\nbelow 170°F (77°C) would be 151°F (66°C); 7°F (4°C) below 170°F (77°C) would be\n163°F (73°C). Hence, after immersing the thermometer which has been previously\ncooled, in the 170°F (77°C) bath, the stopwatch is started when the thermometer\nreads 151°F (66°C) and stopped when it reads 163°F (73°C). Note.-The test included the pasteurization temperature of 161°F\nand 166°F (72°C and 75°C). Corrective Action. -If the response time should\nexceed 4 seconds, the thermometer should be replaced or returned for\nrepair. TEST 8. RECORDER/CONTROLLER-THERMOMETRIC\nRESPONSE\nReference. -Item 16p(B). Application. -To all recorder/controllers used in\nconnection with continuous-flow pasteurizers except those in which the\nflow-diversion device is located at the end of the cooler section. Frequency. -Upon installation and at least once\neach 3 months thereafter. Criteria. -Five seconds, under specified\nconditions. Apparatus. -Previously tested indicating\nthermometer on pasteurizers), stopwatch, water or oil bath (10-gallon milk\ncan), agitator, heat supply. Method. -Measure the time interval between the\ninstant when the recording thermometer reads 12°F (7°C) below the cut-in\ntemperature and the moment of cut-in by the controller. This measurement is\nmade when the sensing element is immersed in a rapidly agitated water or oil\nbath maintained at exactly 7°F (4°C) above the cut-in temperature. Procedure. -1. Check and, if necessary, adjust the\npen-arm setting of the recording thermometer in the proper reference arc to\nagree with the indicating thermometer reading at pasteurization\ntemperature. 2. Determine the cut-in temperature of controller (Test 10), either while in normal operation or by using a water or oil bath. 3. Remove sensing element and allow to cool to room\ntemperature. 4 Heat water or oil bath to exactly 7°F (4°C) above the cut-in\ntemperature while vigorously agitating bath to insure uniform\ntemperature. 5. Immerse recorder/controller bulb in bath. Continue agitation\nduring items 6. and 7. below. 6. Start stopwatch when the recording thermometer reaches a\ntemperature of 12°F (7°C) below the cut-in temperature. 7. Stop stopwatch when the controller cuts in. 8. Record thermometric response time for office record. Corrective Action. -If the response should exceed 5\nseconds, the recorder/controller should be repaired. TEST 9. SETTING OF CONTROL SWITCHES-REGENERATOR\nPRESSURE\nReference. -Item 16p(D). 1. PRESSURE SWITCHES. -Used to control operation of\nbooster pumps. Application. -To all pressure switches controlling\nthe operations of booster pumps on HTST pasteurizer systems employing\nregenerators. Frequency. -Upon installation, each 3 months\nthereafter, after any change in the booster pump or the switch circuit, and/or\nwhenever the pressure switch seal is broken. Criteria. -The pump shall not operate unless there\nis at least a 1-pound pressure differential on the pasteurized milk side of the\nregenerator. Apparatus. -Sanitary pressure gauge and pneumatic\ntesting device, for checking and adjusting pressure switch settings. A simple inexpensive pneumatic testing device may be made from\na discarded 2 inch-7BX sanitary tee, with two additional 13H nuts, one of which\nis provided with a 16A cap, drilled and tapped for a 1/2-inch galvanized iron\nnipple for the air connection. A hose connection is made to a compressed air\nsource in the plant by means of a snap-on fitting. The air pressure can be\ncontrolled by an inexpensive pressure reducing valve (range 0-60 psig) followed\nby a 1/2-inch globe type bleeder valve connected into the side outlet of a\n1/2-inch tee installed between the pressure reducing valve and the testing\ndevice. The pressure switch to be tested is disconnected from the pasteurizer\nand connected to another of the outlets of the sanitary tee, and the pressure\ngauge is connected to the third outlet of the sanitary tee. By careful\nmanipulation of the air pressure reducing valve and the air bleeder valve, the\nair pressure in the testing device may be regulated slowly and precisely. (In\noperating the device, care should be taken to avoid exposing the pressure\nswitch and the sanitary pressure gauge to excessive pressure which might damage\nthem. This can be done by first closing off the air pressure regulating valve\nand opening fully the bleeder valve; these may then be manipulated slowly to\nbring the air pressure in the testing device within the desired range.) A test\nlight of proper voltage can be placed in series with the pressure switch\ncontact and in parallel with the electrical load (booster pump starter) so the\nactuation point may be readily determined. Method. -Check and make adjustment of pressure\nswitch so as to prevent the operation of the booster pump unless the pressure\non the pasteurized milk side of the regenerator is greater by at least 1 psi\nthan any pressure that may be generated on the raw side. Procedure. -(a) Determine maximum pressure of\nbooster pump. (1.) Install sanitary pressure gauge in tee at discharge of\nbooster pump. (2.) Operate the pasteurizer with water, with the\nflow-diversion device in forward-flow position, the metering pump operating at\nminimum speed possible, and the booster pump operating at its rated speed. If\nvacuum equipment is located between the raw outlet from the regenerator and the\nmetering pump, it should be bypassed while this determination is made. (3.) Note maximum pressure indicated by pressure gauge under\nthese conditions. (b) Check and set the pressure switch. (1.) Install a sanitary pressure gauge of known accuracy on the\npneumatic testing device to which the pressure switch sensing element should\nalso be connected. (2.) Remove the seal and cover to expose adjustment mechanism\non pressure switch. (3.) Operate the testing device and determine the pressure\ngauge reading at the cut-in point of the pressure switch which will light the\ntest lamp. (If the switch is short circuited, the lamp will be lighted before\nair pressure is applied.)\n(4.) The cut-in point should be adjusted, if necessary, so as\nto occur at a pressure gauge reading at least 1 psi greater than the maximum\nbooster pump operating pressure, as determined under section a. of this method. Where adjustment is necessary, refer to manufacturer's instructions for\nadjusting procedure. After adjustment, recheck actuation point and readjust if\nnecessary. (5.) Replace cover and seal the pressure switch and restore\nsensing element to original location. (6.) Record test results for the office record. 2. TIME DELAY SWITCHES. -Used to control operation\nof booster pumps. Application. -To all time-delay switches\ncontrolling operation of booster pumps. Frequency. -Upon installation, after any change in\nthe pump or relay circuit and whenever seal is broken. Criteria. -The booster pump shall not operate until\nthe pasteurized milk has achieved a pressure at least 1 pound greater than the\nmaximum pressure developed by the booster pump. Apparatus. -Accurate stopwatch, graduated at\nintervals not to exceed 0.2 of 1 second, pressure gauge or manometer. Method. -Reference: Dashiell, W. N., Use of\n\nTime Delay Relay To Control Booster Pump Operation. Journal of Milk\nand Food Technology, 21:7. July 1958. Procedure. -a. Operate pasteurizers with water with\nthe flow-diversion device in forward-flow position, metering pump operating at\nminimum speed, booster pump at rated speed. Vacuum equipment not operating or\nbypassed. b. Determine the maximum pressure developed at the discharge of\nthe booster pump. Following the determination of the height of the liquid\nlevel, add at least 3 feet to provide the 1-pound pressure differential\nequivalent of 0.7 feet of water column to compensate for difference in the\nspecific gravity between water at 161°F (72°C) and raw milk at 40°F (4°C). The\npasteurized liquid level must rise to the computed elevation, above the outlet\nlevel of the booster pump and be vented to the atmosphere at this or higher\nlevel. c. Time the interval from the moment the forward flow is\nestablished until the pasteurized liquid level rises to the required elevation. The time measurement shall be made at the beginning of a run when no water is\nin the pasteurized product line. The booster pump shall not be\noperating. d. The time delay relay shall be installed in the circuit, interlocked with the metering pump, forward-flow of the flow-diversion device\nand the booster pump. Adjust the time delay setting to provide the time\ninterval. Check the setting several times. Seal the time delay relay. e. Record for permanent office record. Corrective Action. -Adjust pasteurized milk pipe\nto proper elevation. If time delay relay is not accurate, return for\nrepair. 3. PRESSURE GAUGES. -Used with booster pump\noperations\n\nApplication. -To all required pressure gauges\nused to measure relative raw milk and pasteurized milk pressure in HTST\nregenerators. Frequency. -Upon installation, each 3 months\nthereafter, and whenever the gauges are adjusted or repaired. Criteria. -Required pressure gauges shall be\naccurate. Apparatus. -Identical testing device used to check\nproper operation of pressure switch (Test 9, 1). A pressure gauge of known accuracy is connected to one outlet\nof the test apparatus. The gauge being checked is connected to the second\noutlet of the sanitary tee. Air is bled into the system through the third\noutlet and comparative readings made. Record test results for office\nrecord. Corrective Action. -Inaccurate gauges should be\nreturned to the factory for repair. It is not recommended that the plant\noperator attempt the adjustment of pressure gauges. 4. DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROLLER\nApplication. -To all differential pressure\ncontrollers used to control operation of booster pumps on HTST and HHST\nsystems, or used to control operation of flow-diversion devices on HHST systems\nwhen no vacuum breaker is located downstream from the holding tube. Frequency. -Upon installation, each 3 months\nthereafter, and whenever the differential pressure controller is adjusted or\nrepaired. Criteria. -The booster pump shall not operate or\nthe pasteurizer shall not operate in forward flow unless the product pressure\nin the pasteurized side of the regenerator is at least 1 psi greater than the\nproduct pressure in the raw side of the regenerator. When the differential\npressure controller is used to control the flow-diversion device on HHST\nsystems, and improper pressures occur in the regenerator, the flow-diversion\ndevice shall move to the diverted-flow position and remain in diverted flow\nuntil proper pressures are reestablished in the re-generator and all\nproduct-contact surfaces between the holding tube and flow-diversion device\nhave been held at or above the required pasteurization temperature, continuously and simultaneously for at least the required pasteurization time\nas defined in section\n2.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. Apparatus. -A sanitary pressure gauge and a\npneumatic testing device described under PRESSURE SWITCHES (Test 9,1) above can\nbe used for checking and adjusting the differential pressure switch\nsetting. Method. -The differential pressure switch is\nchecked and adjusted to prevent operation of the booster pump, or prevent\nforward flow, unless the product pressure in the pasteurized side of the\nregenerator is at least 1 psi greater than the pressure in the raw side of the\nregenerator. Procedures. -a. Loosen the process connection at\nboth pressure sensors and wait for any liquid to drain through the loose\nconnections. Both pointers should be within 0.5 psi of 0 psig. If not, adjust\npointer(s) to read 0 pounds psig. b. Remove both sensors from the process and mount them in a\ntee, either at the discharge of the booster pump, or connected to the pneumatic\ntesting device. Note the separation between the two pointers. The change in\nelevations of the sensors will have caused some change in the zero readings. Turn on the booster pump switch and depress the test push button to operate the\nbooster pump. If the pneumatic testing device is used in lieu of the booster\npump, adjust air pressure to the normal operating pressure of the booster pump. Note that the pointer separation is within 1 psi of that observed before\npressure was applied. If not, the instrument requires adjustment or\nrepair. c. Return the pressure sensors to their normal process\nlocations and turn off the booster pump switch. Manually move and hold the\nwhite pointer (raw side of the regenerator) at the normal operating pressure of\nthe booster pump. Press the test push button while manually moving the orange\npointer (pasteurized side of the regenerator) upscale until the pilot light\nturns on, then slowly move the orange pointer downscale until the pilot light\nturns off. The pilot light should not turn on until the orange pointer is at\nleast 2 psi higher than the white pointer, and the pilot light should turn off\nwhen the orange pointer is no less than 2 psi higher than the white pointer. If\nnecessary, adjust the differential setting. The 2 psi differential represents\nthe sum of the 1 psi differential required between raw and pasteurized product\nin the regenerator, plus the 1 psi imprecision permitted between the two\npressure sensors. d. Seal the instrument and record test results for the office\nrecord. TEST 10. MILK-FLOW CONTROLS-MILK TEMPERATURES AT CUT-IN\nAND CUT-OUT\nReferences. -Item 16p(B), 16p(D). Milk-flow controls shall be tested for milk temperature at\ncut-in and cut-out by one of the following applicable tests at the frequency\nprescribed: 1. Application. -All recorder/controllers used in\nconnection with HTST pasteurizers except those in which the flow-diversion\ndevice is located at the end of the cooler section. Frequency. -Upon installation and quarterly by the\nregulatory agency; daily by the plant operator. Criteria. -No forward flow until pasteurization\ntemperature has been reached. Flow diverted before temperature drops below\nminimum pasteurization temperature. Apparatus. -No supplemental materials\nneeded. Method. -By observing the actual temperature of the\nindicating thermometer at the instant forward flow starts (cut-in) and stops\n(cut-out). Procedure. -a. Cut-in temperature. (1.) While milk or water is completely flooding the sensing\nelement of the recorder/controller and the indicating thermometer, increase the\nheat gradually so as to raise the temperature of the water or milk at a rate\nnot exceeding 1°F (0.5°C) every 30 seconds. (2.) Observe the indicating thermometer reading at the moment\nthe forward flow starts (i.e., flow-diversion device moves). Observe that the\nfrequency pen reading is synchronized with the recording pen on the same\nreference arc. (3.) Record the indicating thermometer reading on the recorder\nchart: inscribe initials. The regulatory agency shall record test\nfindings. b. Cut-out temperature. (1.) After the cut-in temperature has been determined and while\nthe milk or water is above the cut-in temperature, allow the water to cool\nslowly at a rate not exceeding 1°F (0.5°C) per 30 seconds. Observe indicating\nthermometer reading at the instant forward flow stops. (2.) Record the indicating thermometer reading on the recorder\nchart. Corrective Action. -Should the reading be below the\nminimum pasteurization temperature, the cut-in and cut-out mechanism and/or the\ndifferential temperature mechanism should be adjusted to obtain proper cut- in\nand cut-out temperatures by repeated tests. When compliance is achieved, seal\nthe controller mechanism. 2. Application. -All HHST pasteurizers using\nindirect heating. Frequency. -Upon installation, and every 3 months\nthereafter; whenever the thermal controller seal is broken. Criteria. -The pasteurizer shall not operate in\nforward flow unless pasteurization temperature has been achieved. The product\nflow shall be diverted at a temperature no lower than the chosen pasteurization\nstandard. Apparatus. -No supplemental materials\nneeded. Method. -The cut-in and cut-out temperatures are\ndetermined by observing the actual temperature in the constant temperature bath\nat which the two sensing elements signal for forward flow (cut-in) and diverted\nflow (cut-out). Procedures. -a. Wire the test lamp in series with\nthe control contacts of the sensing element (holding tube). Immerse this\nsensing element in the constant temperature bath. Raise the bath temperature at\na rate not exceeding 1°F (0.5°C) every 30 seconds. Observe the temperature\nreading at the cut-in temperature. Record the temperature for the office\nrecord. b. After the cut-in temperature has been determined and while\nthe bath is above the cut-in temperature, allow the bath to cool slowly at a\nrate not exceeding 1°F (0.5°C) per 30 seconds. Observe the temperature reading\non the controller when the test lamp goes out (cut-out temperature). Determine\nthat the cut-out temperature on the thermal limit controller is equivalent to\nor greater than the chosen pasteurization standard. Where adjustment is\nnecessary, refer to manufacturer's instructions. After adjustment, repeat the\nprocedure above and when the results are satisfactory, record results for the\noffice records. c. Repeat the procedure for the other sensing element, (flow-diversion device). When proper cut-out temperature has been verified for\nboth sensing elements, seal the controller system. 3. Application. -All HHST pasteurizers using direct\ncontact heating. Frequency. -Upon installation, and every 3 months\nthereafter; whenever the thermal limit controller seal is broken. Criteria. -The pasteurizer shall not operate in\nforward flow unless pasteurization temperature has been achieved. The product\nflow shall be diverted at a temperature no lower than the chosen pasteurization\nstandard. Apparatus. -No supplemental materials\nneeded. Method. -The cut-in and cut-out temperatures are\ndetermined by observing the actual temperature in the constant temperature bath\nat which each of the three sensing elements signals for forward flow (cut-in)\nand diverted flow (cut-out). Procedures. -a. Wire the test lamp in series with\nthe control contacts of the sensing element (the holding tube). Immerse this\nsensing element in the constant temperature bath. Raise the bath temperature at\na rate not exceeding 1°F (0.5°C) every 30 seconds. Observe the temperature\nreading on the controller when the test lamp lights (cut-in temperature). Record the temperature for the office record. b. After the cut-in temperature has been determined and while\nthe bath is above the cut-in temperature, allow the bath to cool slowly at a\nrate not exceeding 1°F (0.5°C) per 30 seconds.

Determine\nthat the cut-out temperature on the thermal limit controller is equivalent to\nor greater than the chosen pasteurization standard. Where adjustment is\nnecessary, refer to manufacturer's instructions. After adjustment, repeat the\nprocedure above and when the results are satisfactory, record results for the\noffice record. c. Repeat the procedure for the other two sensing elements, i.e., the vacuum chamber and flow-diversion device. Rewire the test lamp in\nseries with the control contacts from each sensing element, respectively. When\nproper cut-out temperatures have been verified for all three sensing elements, seal the controller system. TEST 11. CONTINUOUS FLOW HOLDERS-HOLDING\nTIME\nReference. -Item 16p(B). Continuous flow holders shall be tested for holding times by\none of the applicable tests. 1. Application. -To all HTST pasteurizers employing\na holding time of 15 seconds or longer. Frequency. -As set forth in application 2\nbelow. Criteria. -Every particle of milk shall be held for\nat least 15 seconds in both the forward- and diverted-flow positions. Apparatus. -Electrical conductivity measuring\ndevice, Appendix 4 (I.) capable of detecting change in conductivity, equipped\nwith standard electrodes; table salt (sodium chloride), 50 ml. syringe; stopwatch; suitable container for salt solution. Method. -The holding time is determined by timing\nthe interval for an added trace substance to pass through the holder. Although\nthe time interval of the fastest particle of milk is desired, the conductivity\ntest is made with water. The results found with water are converted to the milk\nflow time by formulation since a pump may not deliver the same amount of milk\nas it does water. Procedure. -a. Examine the entire system to insure\nthat all flow promoting equipment is operating at maximum capacity and all flow\nimpeding equipment is so adjusted or bypassed as to provide the minimum of\nresistance to the flow. There shall be no leakage on the suction side of the\ntiming pump. b. Adjust variable speed pump to its maximum capacity\n(preferably with a new belt and full size impellers). Check homogenizers for\nseals and/or gears or pulley identification. c. Install one electrode at the inlet to the holder and the\nother electrode in the holder outlet. Close the circuit to the electrode\nlocated at the inlet to the holder. d. Operate the pasteurizer using water at pasteurization\ntemperature, with flow-diversion device in forward-flow position. e. Quickly inject 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution\ninto the holder inlet. f. Start the stopwatch with the first movement of the indicator\nof a change in conductivity. Open the circuit to the inlet electrode and close\nthe circuit to the electrode at the outlet of the holder. g. Stop the stopwatch with the first movement of the indicator\nof a change in conductivity. h. Record results\ni. Repeat the test six or more times, until six successive\nresults are within 0 5 seconds of each other. The average of these six tests is\nthe holding time for water in forward flow. When consistent readings cannot be\nobtained, purge the equipment, check instruments and connections, and check for\nair leakage on suction side. Repeat tests. Should consistent readings not be\nobtained, use the fastest time as the holding time for water. j. Repeat steps d. through i. for testing time on water in\ndiverted flow. k. With the pump at the same speed and equipment adjusted as in\na. above, time the filling of a 10-gallon can with a measured weight of water\nusing the discharge outlet with the same head pressure as in normal operation. Average the time of several trials. (Since flow rates of the large capacity\nunits make it very difficult to check by filling a 10-gallon can, it is\nsuggested that a calibrated tank of considerable size be used.)\nl. Repeat procedure k. using milk. m. Compute the holding time for milk from the following formula\nby weight, using the average specific gravity. Compute separately for forward\nflow and diverted flow. Holding time for milk=(1.032(TMw)/Ww) (by weight), in\nwhich-\n1.032 = specific gravity for milk; T = average holding time for water; Mw = average time required to deliver a measured weight of\nmilk. Ww = average time required to deliver an equal weight of\nwater. n. Record results for office record. Corrective Action. -When the computed holding time\nfor milk is less than that required either in forward flow or diverted flow, the speed of the timing pump shall be reduced or adjustment made in the holding\ntube, and the timing test repeated until satisfactory holding time is achieved. Should an orifice be used to correct the holding time in diverted flow, there\nshould be no excessive pressure exerted on the underside of the valve seat of\nthe flow-diversion device. Governors shall be sealed on motors that do not\nprovide a constant speed as provided in Item 16p(B) §\n2.46\nb.6.ii. 2. Application. -To all HHST pasteurizers using\nindirect heating. Frequency.-Upon installation and quarterly thereafter, whenever\nseal on speed setting is broken: any alteration is made affecting the holding\ntime, the velocity of the flow (such as replacement of pump, motor, belt, drive\nor driven pulleys, or decrease in number of HTST plates) or the capacity of\nholding tube: or whenever a check of the capacity indicates a speedup. Except\nthat semiannually two canfill measurements may be substituted for electrical\nconductivity measurements. The canfill measurements shall be conducted as\nprovided in Item k. of Test 11 of this Appendix. Criteria. -Every particle of product shall be held\nfor the minimum holding time in both the forward-and diverted-flow\npositions. Apparatus. -No supplemental materials\nneeded. Method. -Fully developed laminar flow is assumed\nand holding tube length is calculated. An experimental determination of pumping\nrate is required; this is accomplished by determining the time required for the\npasteurizer to fill a vessel of known volume, converting these data by division\nto obtain flow rate in gallons per second, and multiplying this value by the\nproper number in Table 8 of this paragraph to obtain the required length of\nholding tube. Holding tube lengths for HHST pasteurizers with indirect heating\nfor a pumping rate of 1 gallon/second are: TABLE 8\n\nTubing size\n(inches)\n\nHolding time (seconds)\n1\n11/2\n2\n21/2\n3\n\nHolding tube length\n(inches)\n1\n723.0\n300.0\n168.0\n105.0\n71.4\n0.5\n362.0\n150.0\n84.0\n52.4\n35.7\n0.1\n72.3\n30.0\n16.8\n10.5\n7.14\n0.05\n36.2\n15.0\n8.4\n5.24\n3.57\n0.01\n7.23\n3.0\n1.68\n1.05\n0.714\n\nProcedures. -a. Examine the entire system to\nensure that all flow promoting equipment is operating at maximum capacity and\nall flow impeding equipment is so adjusted or bypassed to provide the minimum\nof resistance to the flow. This means that in-line filters must be removed, booster pumps must be in operation, and vacuum equipment in the system must be\noperating at a maximum vacuum. Also, before the tests are begun, the\npasteurizer should be operated at maximum flow for a sufficient time to purge\nair from the system (about 15 minutes) and pipe connections on the suction side\nof the metering pump should be made tight enough to exclude entrance of air. With the pasteurizer operating with water, adjust the metering pump to its\nmaximum capacity, preferably with a new belt and full-size impellers. b. Determine that no flow exists in the diverted line, and\nmeasure the time required to deliver a known volume of water at the\nforward-flow discharge line. Repeat the test at least once to determine that\nthe measurements are consistent. c. Repeat the steps in paragraphs a. and b. of this procedure\nin diverted flow by collecting the effluent at the discharge of the divert\nline. d. Select the greatest flow rate (shortest delivery time for\nthe known volume) and calculate the flow rate in gallons per second by dividing\nthe known volume by the time required to collect the known volume. Multiply\nthis value with the appropriate value in Table 8 to determine the required\nholding tube length. e. Determine the number and type of fittings in the holding\ntube and convert these to equivalent lengths of straight pipe with the use of\n\nTable 9 of this paragraph. Determine the total length of the holding tube by\nadding the equivalent lengths of the fittings to the measured straight lengths\nof pipe. Record the number and type of fittings, the number and length of\nstraight pipes, and the holding tube configuration for the office record. If\nthe temperature sensor is located at the beginning of the holding tube, the\nholding tube shall be protected against heat loss by material that is\nimpervious to water.

Remove\nthe divert line from the raw-product supply tank, and turn off the product pump\nfeeding the raw-product supply task. Suspend a sanitary dip stick in the\nraw-product supply tank, and operate the pasteurizer at maximum capacity. Record the time required for the water level to move between two graduations on\nthe dip stick. The volume of water is calculated from the dimensions of the\nraw-product supply tank and the drop in water level. Flow rate is determined as\nfollows: Divide the volume of water removed from the raw-product supply tank by\nthe time required to remove it. Corrective action. -If the length of the holding\ntube is shorter than the calculated length, reseal the metering pump at a\nslower maximum speed, or lengthen the holding tube, or both, and repeat the\nabove determination. 3. Application. -To all HHST pasteurizers using\ndirect contact heating. Frequency. -When installed and semiannually\nthereafter; whenever seal on the speed setting is broken; whenever any\nalteration is made affecting the holding time, the velocity of the flow, e.g., replacement of pump, motor, belt, driver or driven pulley, or decrease in the\nnumber of heat exchange plates, or the capacity of the holding tube; whenever a\ncheck of the capacity indicates a speedup. Apparatus. -No supplemental materials\nneeded. Criteria. -Every particle of product shall be held\nfor the minimum holding time in both forward- and diverted-flow\npositions. Method. -Fully developed laminar flow and a\ntemperature increase by steam injection of 120°F (67C) are assumed, the\ntemperature-time standard is chosen by the processor, and the required holding\ntube length is calculated from an experimental determination of pumping\nrate. Procedures. -a. Examine the entire system to\nensure that all flow promoting equipment is operating at a maximum capacity and\nall flow impeding equipment is so adjusted or bypassed as so provide the\nminimum resistance to the flow. Remove in-line filters, make certain booster\npumps are operating and that vacuum equipment in the system is operating at\nmaximum vacuum. Also, before the tests are begun, operate the pasteurizer at\nmaximum flow for a sufficient time to purge the air from the system (about 15\nminutes) and tighten pipe connections on the suction side of the metering pump\nto exclude entrance of air. With the pasteurizer operating on water, adjust the\nmetering pump to its maximum capacity. Determine that no flow exists in the\ndiverted line, and measure the time required to deliver a known volume of water\nat the discharge of the pasteurizer in forward flow. Repeat the test at least\ntwice to determine that the measurements are consistent. b. Repeat the last step (a. above) in diverted flow by\ncollecting the effluent at the discharge of the divert line. Select the\ngreatest flow rate, the shortest delivery time for the known volume, and\ncalculate the flow rate in gallons per second by dividing the known volume by\nthe time required to collect the known volume. Multiply this value, gallons per\nsecond, with the appropriate value in Table 10 of this paragraph to determine\nthe required holding tube length. Holding tube lengths for direct contact\nheating pasteurizers with a pumping rate of 1 gallon/second are: TABLE 10\n\nTubing size\n(inches)\n\nHolding time (seconds)\n1\n11/2\n2\n21/2\n3\n\nHolding tube length\n(inches)\n1\n810.0\n336.0\n188.0\n118.0\n80.0\n0.5\n405.0\n168.0\n94.0\n59.0\n40.0\n0.1\n81.0\n33.6\n18.8\n11.8\n8.0\n0.05\n40.5\n16.8\n9.40\n5.90\n4.0\n0.01\n8.10\n3.36\n1.88\n1.18\n0.8\nc. Determine the number and type of fittings in the holding\ntube, and convert these to equivalent lengths of straight pipe with the use of\n\nTable 9. Determine the total length of the holding tube by adding the\nequivalent lengths of the fittings to the measured lengths of straight pipe. If\nthe actual holding tube length is equivalent to or greater than the required\nholding tube length, record the number and type of fittings, the number and\nlength of straight pipes, and the holding tube configuration, for the office\nrecord. Make sure that the holding tube slopes upward at least 0.25 inch per\nfoot. The holding tube shall also be protected against heat loss with\ninsulation that is impervious to water if the temperature sensor is located at\nthe beginning of the holding tube. Alternate procedure. -For pasteurizers of large\ncapacity, the method of measuring flow rate at the discharge of the pasteurizer\nis inconvenient, and the following alternate test procedure may be used. Remove\nthe divert line from the raw product supply tank, and turn off the product pump\nfeeding the raw-product supply tank. Suspend a sanitary dip stick in the\nraw-product supply tank, and operate the pasteurizer at maximum capacity. Record the time required for the water level to move between two graduations on\nthe dip stick. Calculate the volume of water from the dimensions of the\nraw-product supply tank and the drop in water level. Determine flow rate as\nfollows: Divide the volume of water, in gallons, removed from the raw-product\nsupply tank by the time, in seconds, required to remove it. Then use Table 10\nto calculate the required holding tube length. Corrective action. -If the length of the holding\ntube is shorter than the calculated length, reseal the metering pump at a\nslower maximum speed, or lengthen the holding tube, or both, and repeat the\nprocedure.
