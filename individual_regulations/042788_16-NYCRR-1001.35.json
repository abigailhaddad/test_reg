  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.35 - Exhibit 35: electric and magnetic fields\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 35 shall contain: (a) For the entire right-of-way of the\nproposed power line providing the electrical interconnection between the\nproposed facility and the existing electric transmission and distribution\nsystem, identify every right-of-way segment having unique electric and magnetic\nfield (EMF) characteristics due to structure types and average heights, rights-of-way widths, and co-location of other transmission facilities in the\nright-of-way. (b) For each\nidentified right-of-way segment, provide both \"base case\" and \"proposed\"\ncross-sections to scale showing: (1)\nall\noverhead electric transmission, sub-transmission and distribution facilities\nincluding the proposed facility showing structural details and dimensions and\nidentifying phase spacing, phasing, and any other characteristics affecting EMF\nemissions; (2)\nall underground\nelectric transmission, sub-transmission and distribution facilities; (3)\nall underground gas transmission\nfacilities; (4)\nall right-of-way\nboundaries; and\n(5)\nstructural\ndetails and dimensions for all structures (dimensions, phase spacing, phasing, and similar categories) and include a Station number identifying the\nlocation. (c) A set of\nthe aerial photos/drawings enhanced by showing the exact location of each: (1)\nidentified right-of-way\nsegment; (2)\ncross-section; and\n(3)\nnearest residence or\noccupied non-residential building in each identified right-of-way segment with\na stated measurement of the distance between the edge of right-of-way and the\nnearest edge of the residence or building. (d) An EMF study with calculation tables and\nfield strength graphs for each identified right-of-way segment cross-section, as follows: (1)\nthe study must be signed and\nstamped/sealed by a licensed professional engineer registered and in good\nstanding in the State of New York; (2)\nprovide the name of the computer software\nprogram used to model the facilities and make the calculations; (3)\nregarding electric fields, model the\ncircuits at rated voltage and provide electric field calculation tables and\nfield strength graphs calculated at one meter above ground level with five foot\nmeasurement intervals depicting the width of the entire right-of-way and out to\n500 feet from the edge of the right-of-way on both sides, including digital\ncopies of all input assumptions and outputs for the calculations; (4)\nregarding magnetic fields, model the\ncircuit phase currents equal to the summer normal, summer short term emergency\n(STE sum), winter- normal, and winter short term emergency (STE win) loading\nconditions and provide magnetic field calculation tables and field strength\ngraphs calculated at one meter above ground level with five foot measurement\nintervals depicting the width of the entire right-of-way and out to 500 feet\nfrom the edge of the right-of-way on both sides, including digital copies of\nall input assumptions and outputs for the calculations; (5)\nregarding magnetic fields, also model the\ncircuit phase currents equal to the maximum average annual load estimated to be\noccurring on the power lines within 10 years after the proposed facility is put\nin operation and provide magnetic field calculation tables and field strength\ngraphs calculated at one meter above ground level with five foot measurement\nintervals depicting the width of the entire right-of-way and out to 500 feet\nfrom the edge of the right-of-way on both sides, including digital copies of\nall input assumptions and outputs for the calculations; and\n(6)\nregarding magnetic fields, also model a\n\"base case\" with the circuit phase currents equal to the maximum average annual\nload currently estimated to be occurring on the existing power lines within the\nright- of-way (without construction or operation of the proposed Facility) and\nprovide magnetic field calculation tables and field strength graphs calculated\nat one meter above ground level with five foot measurement intervals depicting\nthe width of the entire right-of-way and out to 500 feet from the edge of the\nright-of-way on both sides, including digital copies of all input assumptions\nand outputs for the calculations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.35\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
