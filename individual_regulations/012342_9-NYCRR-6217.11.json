  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6217.11 - Voter registration list security and user administration\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Statewide. NYSVoter relies on shared security with both the county board and State Board\nhaving responsibilities over specific system resources and administration. The\n\nState Board will be responsible for providing tools necessary for county boards\nto authorize local users to NYSVoter functions, verify that local users\nidentified in transaction headers are authorized for that purpose, and for\ninsuring that a message was not altered in transmission. (b) County board. Security over county voter\nregistration systems and networks, administration of local users, authentication and authorization of county board personnel will be the\nresponsibility of each county board. Each county board will configure the local\ncounty user to have access pursuant to NYSVoter. Since access to NYSVoter will\nbe through the county voter registration system, administration and\nauthorization to the county voter registration system must include the\nassignment of a user ID and password for the county voter registration system\nthat has a role or user-based security management. County boards will have the\nrights to create and modify county users as well as delete users when\nappropriate in their own county. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n6217.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
