  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2100.11 - Conversions after May 1, 1950\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any housing accommodations resulting from conversion of housing accommodations\ncreated on or after May 1, 1950 shall continue to be subject to rent control\nunless the administrator issues an order decontrolling them which he shall do\nif there has been a structural change in a residential unit or units involving\nsubstantial alterations or remodeling; and such change has resulted in\nadditional housing accommodations consisting of self-contained family units, provided, however, that such order of decontrol shall not apply to that portion\nof the original housing accommodations occupied by a tenant in possession at\nthe time of the conversion, only so long as such tenant continues in occupancy. Such order shall be effective as of the date of the completion of such\nconversion. Where the date of first renting is prior to the date of completion\nthe landlord may make application for an order establishing a maximum rent\npursuant to section\n2102.6\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. Such maximum rent shall remain in effect until further order of the\nadministrator pursuant to this section. (1)\n\nThe term self-contained family unit shall mean a housing accommodation with\nprivate access, containing two or more rooms, consisting of at least one\nbedroom and a living room- dining space area in addition to a kitchen (with\ncooking and refrigeration facilities and a sink), having a minimum total area\nof 410 square feet for the foregoing rooms, and a private bathroom (with a wash\nbasin, toilet and bathtub or enclosed shower). Such accommodation shall also\ncontain at least one closet plus an additional closet for each bedroom which\nshall not be included in the computation of the total floor area. In lieu of a\nkitchen the accommodation may include an enclosed kitchenette or an area in the\nliving room which is either recessed or semienclosed provided that all of the\nabove-specified kitchen facilities and equipment are within such recessed or\nsemi-enclosed area. Where, however, the landlord establishes that either the\ntwo-room or total floor area requirement, or both, cannot be complied with\nbecause of unique or peculiar circumstances, the administrator may waive this\nrequirement where he finds that such waiver is not inconsistent with the\npurposes of the act or this Subchapter and would not be likely to result in the\ncircumvention or evasion thereof. (b) No order of decontrol shall be issued\nunder this section unless such conversion occurred after the entire structure, or any lesser portion thereof as may have been thus converted, was vacated by\nvoluntary surrender of possession or in the manner provided in Part 2104 of\nthis Subchapter and unless the administrator shall find that the landlord has\nsatisfied all of the requirements of the authorities having jurisdiction over\nsuch conversion and over the occupancy of the newly created housing\naccommodations. (c) Where housing\naccommodations were or are decontrolled by an order issued pursuant to this\nsection and a municipal department having jurisdiction thereafter certifies the\nhousing accommodations to be a fire hazard or in a continued dangerous\ncondition or detrimental to life or health, such housing accommodations shall\nbe subject to this Subchapter, but only so long as such illegal or hazardous\ncondition continues and without further certification with respect\nthereto. (d) No order of decontrol\nshall be issued by the administrator where there is a conversion of occupied\nhousing accommodations unless and until the landlord obtains an order\nauthorizing subdivision or a certificate of eviction in accordance with the\nprovisions of section\n2104.7\nof this Title.
