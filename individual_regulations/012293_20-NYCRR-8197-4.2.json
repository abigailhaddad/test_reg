  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8197-4.2 - Complaints; hearings; reports\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A complainant, either an owner of special\nfranchise property or an assessing unit in which special franchise property is\nlocated, may obtain administrative review of a tentative assessment or full\nvalue of such property as determined, pursuant to section\n608\nof the Real Property Tax Law by serving\na complaint as specified in section\n610\nof the Real Property Tax Law. Complaints\nand supporting documentation may be served personally at the Albany Office of\nthe commissioner or by mail. If a complaint is not supported by documentation\nor is otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of this section, the\ncommissioner will recommend to the State Board that the tentative special\nfranchise assessments or full values be established as final. (b) (1)\n\nThe\ncomplaint shall be in writing on a form prescribed by ORPTS and signed by the\nchief executive officer or legal representative of the complainant, or by a\nperson authorized in writing by either of those individuals to file such a\ncomplaint. The complaint submitted shall consist of the original and two\ncopies. A complaint must specify the owner and assessing unit of each tentative\nassessment or tentative full value against which that complaint is filed. Each\ncomplaint must provide, at a minimum, an opinion of the proper value of the\nspecial franchise as of the appropriate valuation date, documentation to\nsupport that opinion of value, and an explanation of how that opinion is\nderived from the documentation submitted. Nothing herein shall be deemed to\nprevent a complainant from receiving a larger reduction than requested on a\ncomplaint form or a larger increase than requested on a complaint\nform. (2)\n\nIf a complainant owns\nspecial franchise property in more than one assessing unit, a single complaint\nfrom may be filed for all tentative assessments or full values that are subject\nof a particular hearing, and supporting documentation submitted with that\ncomplaint may reference property in more than one assessing unit. However, there must be a separate opinion of value and explanation of that opinion for\neach tentative assessment or full value which is a subject of that\ncomplaint. (3)\n\nNothing herein shall\nbe deemed to allow a complainant to challenge the computation or establishment\nof a final State equalization rate, special equalization rate or uniform\npercentage of value used to equalize tentative special franchise assessments\npursuant to section\n606\nof the Real Property Tax Law. (4)\n\nAny request in a complaint by an owner\nfor economic obsolescence, functional obsolescence or use of an alternative\nvaluation component that was not submitted with the reports required by Subpart\n8197-2 of this Part must contain an explanation of why such request was not\nsubmitted with those reports as required by section\n8197-2.8\nof this Part and that such failure was due to circumstances beyond the control\nof the owner. (5)\n\nAny complainant\nthat has failed to submit a report required by Subpart 8197-2 of this Part, or\nto submit a report within the time limits of that Subpart, or to submit\nadditional information requested pursuant to section\n8197-2.12\nof this Part, must submit with its complaint information showing that this\nfailure was due to circumstances beyond the control of the complainant. This\nrequest and a staff evaluation shall be submitted to the State Board along with\nthe staff recommendation for final assessment or full value. (6)\n\nNothing herein shall be deemed to require\nan owner or an assessing unit to submit with a complaint any information\nalready provided to ORPTS. This information may be incorporated by\nreference. (c) (1)\n\nThe hearing shall not constitute an\nadjudicatory proceeding subject to article 3 of the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act. The commissioner's designee as hearing officer shall rule on any\nprocedural matters arising at the hearing and shall report to the State Board\non these matters and any legal issues raised in any complaint. The hearing\nofficer may accept materials offered by a complainant at the hearing. All\nmaterials not submitted and served with a complaint shall be accompanied by an\naffidavit of service upon the adverse party. An adverse party may participate\nat a hearing, even though that party has not submitted a complaint, to the\nextent of providing information to support the tentative assessment or full\nvalue in response to issues raised in the complaint filed. The hearing officer\nmay, in his or her discretion, grant a complainant or an adverse party that has\nnot submitted a complaint up to 10 days to submit written information in\nrebuttal of any assertion made or information submitted at the hearing or\ncontained in a complaint. (2)\n\nIf\nnot satisfied that the complainant has established that the tentative\nassessment or full value is incorrect, ORPTS, through the hearing officer, may\nrequest that the assessing unit or owner produce any papers or other\ninformation relating to the tentative assessment or full value at the hearing\nor within a reasonable time thereafter. If a complainant shall willfully\nneglect or refuse to provide such material, ORPTS shall recommend to the State\n\nBoard that, as provided in sections\n512, 525\nand\n612\nof the Real Property Tax Law, the\nrequested changes not be made to the tentative assessment or full\nvalue. (d) If a special\nfranchise owner or assessing unit establishes that a different assessment or\nfull value should have been computed and established, that assessment or full\nvalue shall be submitted by ORPTS to the State Board with a recommendation that\nit be established as the final special franchise assessment or final special\nfranchise full value. Otherwise, the final special franchise assessment or\nfinal special franchise full value shall be computed using the data used to\ncompute the tentative assessment or tentative full value. (e) Where a complainant owner seeks a\nreduction in a tentative assessment or full value and no complaint is received\nfrom the appropriate assessing unit, the tentative assessment or full value may\nnot be increased. Where a complainant assessing unit seeks an increase in a\ntentative assessment or full value and no complaint is received from the\nappropriate owner, the tentative assessment or full value may not be\nreduced.
