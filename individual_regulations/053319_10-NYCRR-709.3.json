  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 709.3 - Residential health care facility beds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section\n709.1\n(a), (b), and (c) of this Part, the methodology and procedures in this section will be\nused in the evaluation of certificate of need applications involving the\nconstruction of new or replacement residential health care facility beds, the\nrenovation of residential health care facilities, the sale or transfer of\nresidential health care facility beds between facilities, or the establishment\nof residential health care facilities, including changes of ownership subject\nto review by the Public Health Council. (b) (1)\n\nFor\npurposes of this methodology, the base year shall be 2006 and the planning\ntarget year shall be 2016. The planning area shall be the county except as\notherwise provided for in this section. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of\nthis section, the estimates of public need for residential health care facility\nbeds determined under this section for the planning target year shall continue\nto be the estimates of public need for such beds for years subsequent to the\nplanning target year until a new bed need methodology is promulgated. (c) The methodology uses the\nfollowing steps to estimate the need for residential health care facility beds\nin the planning target year: (1)\n\nThe\npopulation age 0-64 is estimated by county for the base year and planning\ntarget year in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (2)\n\nThe number of functionally dependent\nindividuals in the population age 65 and older is estimated by county for the\nbase year and the planning target year in paragraph (d)(2) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nThe population age\n0-64 and the number of functionally dependent individuals aged 65 and older in\neach county for the base year is summed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section to\nderive the statewide totals for each age group. (4)\n\nStatewide normative use rates for\nresidential health care facilities, long term community based care and\nsupportive housing are calculated in paragraphs (d)(4), (5) and (6) of this\nsection for the population age 0-64 and for the functionally dependent\npopulation age 65 and older. (5)\n\nThe statewide pattern need estimates for residential health care facility beds, long term community based services and supportive housing in the planning\ntarget year are calculated in paragraph (d)(7) of this section by county by\nmultiplying the statewide normative use rates by the appropriate population\ngroup. (6)\n\nThe need estimates for\nresidential health care facility beds, long term community based services and\nsupportive housing are summed to determine total long term care need for each\ncounty in paragraph (d)(8) of this section. (7)\n\nLocal pattern need estimates for\nresidential health care facility beds, long term community based services and\nsupportive housing in the planning target year are calculated based on the\nlocal pattern distribution of long term care services in the base year in\nparagraph (d)(9) of this section. (8)\n\nThe statewide pattern need estimates and\nthe local pattern need estimates are averaged in paragraph (d)(10) of this\nsection to derive the blended need estimate for residential health care\nfacility beds, long term community based care and supportive housing. (9)\n\nThe blended need estimates for\nresidential health care facility beds are adjusted to reflect a 99 percent\noccupancy rate in paragraph (d)(11) of this section. (10)\n\nThe residential health care facility bed\nneed estimates are adjusted to reflect migration between counties in the State, to facilities outside the State and for patients migrating from other states to\n\nNew York in paragraph (d)(12) of this section. (11)\n\nThe relationship of the need estimates\nfor residential health care facility beds to special populations is addressed\nin paragraphs (d)(13) and (14) of this section. (12)\n\nThe requirement for the department to\nevaluate the residential health care facility bed need methodology and the\nappropriateness of certain assumptions set forth in this section is addressed\nin paragraph (d)(15) of this section. (13)\n\nThe development of long term care plans\nby the health systems agencies and the types of adjustments to the need\nestimates that may be recommended in these plans is addressed in subdivision\n(e) of this section. (14)\n\nSubdivision (f) of this section provides that the bed need estimates for the\nplanning target year shall constitute the public need for residential health\ncare facility beds in the planning area. (15)\n\nRemaining need for construction of\nadditional residential health care facility beds is calculated by county in\nsubdivision (g) of this section. (16)\n\nFactors which could be considered by the\ndepartment to modify the need estimates developed in accordance with\nsubdivision (d) of this section are described in subdivision (h) of this\nsection. (d) The\nmethodology for determining the public need for residential health care\nfacility beds and the estimates of projected need by county for the planning\ntarget year shall be as follows: (1)\n\nThe\npopulation age 0-64 shall be estimated by county for the base year and the\nplanning target year using New York State Data Center projections. (2)\n(i) The\npopulation age 65-74 and 75 and older shall be estimated by county for the base\nyear and the planning target year using New York State Data Center\nprojections. (ii)\n\nThe total number\nof functionally dependent individuals age 65 and older shall be estimated by\ncounty for the base year and planning target year based on the percentage of\nsuch individuals found in the population age 65 and older derived from U.S. Census Bureau data which identified those with a self-care limitation as those\nwho resided in the community but report having a condition that makes\nactivities of daily life difficult, plus those who resided in residential\nhealth care facilities. Estimating the functionally dependent population age 65\nand older identifies a sub-set of the population age 65 and older of which a\nfurther sub-set will need long term care services from the formal support\nsystem, such as residential health care facility beds, supportive housing and\nlong term community based services. (3)\n\nThe population estimates for those age\n0-64 derived in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision in each\ncounty and the population estimates of the functionally dependent individuals\nage 65 and older derived in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision\nin each county for the base year shall be summed to derive the State total for\neach age group. (4)\n\nThe average\ndaily census of persons served with long term care services in the base year\nshall be determined by age for the 0-64 age group and for those age 65 and\nolder. Such data shall include, but not be limited to, the following long term\ncare services: (i) residential health care\nfacility patients by county of origin including New York State residents served\nin out-of-state facilities; (ii)\npersons served in the personal care program; (iii)\npersons served in adult care facilities\nserving the frail elderly; (iv)\npersons served by certified home health agencies with a length of stay of 90\ndays or longer; (v) persons served\nby long term home health care programs; (vi)\npersons served by managed long term care\nplans; and\n(vii)\npatients in\ngeneral hospitals on alternate level of care status with a length of stay on\nsuch status of seven days or more. (5)\n\nFor purposes of calculating appropriate\nnormative use rates, the number of long term care patients served in the base\nyear shall be summed by age group for the three long term care categories of\nresidential health care facilities, long term community based care (including\nlong term home health care programs, certified home health agency services to\nlong term care patients, managed long term care plans and personal care\nprograms) and supportive housing (including adult care homes and enriched\nhousing programs. The number of patients on alternate level of care status\nshall be allocated between long-term community based care services and\nresidential health care facilities. (6)\n\nStatewide normative use rates shall be\ncalculated for residential health care facilities, long term community based\ncare and supportive housing for the population age 0-64 and for the\nfunctionally dependent population age 65 and older. Such statewide normative\nuse rates shall be calculated by dividing the total patient population for\nresidential health care facilities, long term community based services and\nsupportive housing determined in accordance with paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision by the estimated base year population age 0- 64 and the number of\nthe functionally dependent age 65 and older. (7)\n\nThe statewide normative use rates derived\nin paragraph (6) of this subdivision shall be multiplied by the estimated\ncounty level population age 0- 64 and estimated number of the functionally\ndependent age 65 and older for the planning target year to derive county level\nestimates of the need for residential health care facility beds, persons to be\nserved in supportive housing and long term community based services needs. These need estimates shall be referred to as the statewide pattern need\nestimates. (8)\n\nThe total long term\ncare need for each county is calculated by summing the need for residential\nhealth care facility beds, long term community based care and supportive\nhousing. This sum represents an estimate of the total number of people in need\nof long term care services on a daily basis as represented by the statewide\nnormative use rates. (9)\n\nThe local\npattern of distribution of long term care services shall be calculated by\ncounty using the percentage distribution of resources in the county for\nresidential health care facility beds, supportive housing and long term\ncommunity based services in the base year. These percentages are multiplied by\nthe total long term care need for the county derived in paragraph (8) of this\nsubdivision to calculate the local pattern need estimates for residential\nhealth care facility beds, supportive housing and long term community based\ncare. (10)\n\nThe need for residential\nhealth care facility beds calculated using the statewide pattern and the local\npattern shall be averaged to estimate the blended need for each service\ncategory in the county for the planning target year. (11)\n\nThe residential health care facility\nbeds in each county resulting from blending the statewide pattern need and the\nlocal pattern need in paragraph (10) of this subdivision shall be adjusted to\nreflect a 99 percent occupancy rate. (12)\n\nThe residential health care facility\nbeds in each county resulting from the occupancy adjustment in paragraph (11)\nof this subdivision shall be adjusted to reflect migration between counties and\nto and from other states. In general, migration is estimated to be 50 percent\nvoluntary and likely to continue regardless of the availability of resources in\nthe county of origin and 50 percent involuntary resulting from the\nunavailability of resources in the county of origin. Migration adjustments\nshall be based on base year data and shall include: (i) Migration from the county of origin to\nother New York State counties. Such migration adjustment shall be equal to 50\npercent of the number of residential health care facility beds that would be\nrequired in the planning target year for residents who have migrated from\nanother county for residential health care facility services calculated based\non the proportion of county of origin patients migrating to the county of\ndestination in the base year multiplied by the planning target year county of\norigin residential health care facility need. (ii)\n\nMigration to facilities outside New York\n\nState. Such migration adjustment shall be equal to 50 percent of the Medicaid\npatients served outside New York State calculated based upon Medicaid claims\ndata concerning out-of-state placements in the base year. (iii)\n\nOut-of-state migration to New York\n\nState facilities. Such migration adjustment shall be equal to 100 percent of\nthe patients reported by residential health care facilities in the base\nyear. (13)\n\nThe estimates\nof need for residential health care facility beds determined in accordance with\nthis subdivision do not include estimates of need for residential health care\nfacility beds for special pediatric beds, ventilator beds, patients with\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome or those in need of long term\nrehabilitation for head injury. Need for residential health care facility beds\nto serve such patients shall be in addition to the estimates of need determined\nin accordance with paragraphs (1) through (12) of this subdivision. (14)\n\nThe estimates of need for residential\nhealth care facility beds determined in accordance with this subdivision\ninclude beds needed for dementia patients, e.g., Alzheimers disease and related\ndisorders. (15)\n\nThe department\nshall conduct an evaluation of the residential health care facility bed need\nmethodology set forth in this section by December 31, 2013. (e) (1)\n\nThe estimates of need for residential\nhealth care facility beds, supportive housing and long term community based\nservices developed in accordance with subdivision (d) of this section shall\nserve as the basis for development of long term care plans by the health\nsystems agencies that are operational. These need estimates may be modified in\naccordance with paragraph (4) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe long term care plans shall describe\nthe steps that will be taken on a regional basis to develop the long term care\nsystem to meet the needs for residential health care facilities, long term\ncommunity based services and supportive housing. These plans should be\ndeveloped by the health systems agency in consultation with providers, consumers, local governments and other entities within the health systems\nagency region having an interest in long term care services. To be used by the\ndepartment in reviewing certificate of need applications, the long term care\nplan must be approved by the Commissioner of Health with the advice of the\n\nState Hospital Review and Planning Council, provided, however, that if a long\nterm care plan has not been developed by the health systems agency and approved\nby the Commissioner of Health with the advice of the State Hospital Review and\n\nPlanning Council at the time an application is considered by the department, the need estimates shall be determined in accordance with subdivision (d) of\nthis section without a long term care plan adjustment. (3)\n\nThe long term care plans developed by the\nhealth systems agencies shall include but need not be limited to: (i) Designation of long term care planning\nareas. Long term care planning areas may include a single county or two or more\ncounties grouped together but may not include portions of a county. The\ncriteria for establishing long term care planning areas shall be reflective of\nat least the following: (a) voluntary patient\nmigration patterns; (b) travel\npatterns including driving time. (4)\n\nThe health systems agency long term care\nplans may make recommendations for amending the need estimates developed in\naccordance with subdivision (d) of this section to reflect local\ncharacteristics. Factors that may be considered in this analysis include, but\nare not limited to, the following: (i) Adjustments for additional migration between health systems agency regions that\nis documented and agreed upon in writing by the affected health systems\nagencies. (ii)\n\nAdjustments to the\nallocation of long term care services between components of the long term care\nservice system-residential health care facilities, long term community based\nservices and supportive housing. Factors that may be considered in reallocation\nof the need between components of the long term care service system may include\nissues related to geographic considerations or manpower availability. All such\nrecommendations should clearly demonstrate why these adjustments are necessary\nand how they will benefit the planning area. (f) (1)\n\nThe\nbed need estimates developed pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section, together with any approved adjustments developed in accordance with subdivision\n(e) of this section, shall constitute the public need for residential health\ncare facility beds in the planning areas defined subject to further adjustments\nin accordance with subdivision (h) of this section. (2)\n\nFor purposes of determining public need\nfor residential health care facility beds in the City of New York, the public\nneed estimates for each county in the City of New York, determined in\naccordance with this section, shall be summed. For purposes of determining\npublic need for residential health care facility beds in the counties of Nassau\nand Suffolk, the public need estimates for each of these two counties, determined in accordance with this section, shall be summed. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding that there is an\nindication of need in a planning area for additional residential health care\nfacility beds as determined in accordance with subdivision (d) or (e) of this\nsection, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that there is no need for any\nadditional residential health care facility beds in such planning area if the\noverall occupancy rate for existing residential health care facility beds in\nsuch planning area is less than 97 percent based on the most recently available\ndata. It shall be the responsibility of an applicant in such instances to\ndemonstrate that there is a need for additional residential health care\nfacility beds despite the less than 97 percent occupancy rate in the\napplicant's planning area utilizing the factors set forth in subdivision (h) of\nthis section. (g) The\nevaluative procedure for determining public need for residential health care\nfacility beds in a planning area for the planning target year shall include, but not be limited to: (1)\nidentification of\nexisting residential health care facility beds in the planning area; (2)\nidentification of residential health care\nfacility beds that have been approved for construction but are not in operation\nin the planning area; (3)\nidentification of resulting total residential health care facility beds that\nwill be available in the planning area; (4)\nidentification of remaining need in the\nplanning area, based upon public need for residential health care facility beds\nin the planning area determined in accordance with subdivision (d) or (e) of\nthis section or adjusted in accordance with subdivision (h) of this\nsection. (h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, when the estimates of\nneed for residential health care facility beds developed in accordance with\nsubdivision (d) or (e) of this section indicate the need for additional\nresidential health care facility beds, such estimates of additional need may be\nmodified, based on information and data gathered from relevant sources relating\nto significant local factors pertaining to an applicant's service/planning\narea, or on statewide factors, where relevant, which factors may include, but\nnot necessarily be limited to, those set forth in paragraphs (1) through (7) of\nthis subdivision. When making recommendations to the State Hospital Review and\n\nPlanning Council and Public Health Council concerning the impact of the factors\nset forth in this subdivision, the department shall, to the extent practicable, indicate the relative priority of such factors. (1)\n\nThe impact of requirements pertaining to\nplacing persons with disabilities into the most integrated setting appropriate\nso as to enable persons with disabilities to interact with nondisable persons\nto the fullest extent possible. (2)\n\nThe growth, availability and cost-effectiveness of long-term home and\ncommunity-based services, other non-institutional residential programs and of\nother programs and services that may serve as a substitute for or prevent the\nneed for residential health care facility placement. (3)\n\nOccupancy rates, and the trend of those\nrates of existing residential health care facilities in the planning area and\nin contiguous counties. (4)\n\nPatient\nmigration patterns that vary from those included in the methodology set forth\nin subdivision (d) of this section. (5)\n\nThe health status of residents of the\nplanning area or the State, as applicable. (6)\n\nRecommendations made by the local health\nsystems agency, if applicable. (7)\n\nDocumented evidence of the unduplicated number of patients on waiting lists who\nare appropriate for and desire admission to a residential health care facility\nwho experience a long waiting time for placement and who cannot be served\nadequately in other settings. (i) An applicant for residential health care\nfacility beds should anticipate that the review of the certificate of need\napplication will be on a competitive basis. Therefore, all information and\nfactors that the applicant deems relevant to the department's determination of\npublic need must be included in the applicant's certificate of need submission. Review of the proposal as submitted by the applicant shall include: (1)\nthe proposal's responses to and\nconsistency with priority considerations specified in any requests for\nproposals issued by the department or the health systems agency; (2)\nthe relationship of the residential\nhealth care facility beds being proposed to any applicable regional or\nstatewide plans; (3)\nthe proposal's\nconsistency with the provisions of section\n709.1\n(d) of this\n\nPart; (4)\nthe availability of less\ncostly or more effective alternative methods of providing the residential\nhealth care facility beds being reviewed; (5)\nwhether the proposed residential health\ncare facility beds would provide improvements or innovations in the financing\nand delivery of health services and serve to promote quality assurance and cost\neffectiveness; (6)\nthe quality of\ncare provided by the residential health care facility in the past; (7)\nin cases involving the reduction or\nelimination of residential health care facility beds including those cases\ninvolving the relocation of a facility or service, the extent to which need\nwill be met adequately and the effect of the reduction, elimination, or\nrelocation of the facility on the ability of low income persons, racial and\nethnic minorities, and other underserved groups, to obtain needed long term\ncare services; (8)\nin cases\ninvolving a proposed service area which includes a neighboring planning area, the ability of residents of such neighboring planning area to access the\nresidential health care facility beds proposed; (9)\nthe contribution the proposed residential\nhealth care facility would make in meeting the health needs of members of\nmedically underserved groups which have traditionally experienced difficulties\nin obtaining equal access to residential health care facility beds (for\nexample, low-income persons, racial and ethnic minorities, and patients on\nalternate level of care status in general hospitals). For the purpose of\ndetermining the extent to which the proposed facility will be accessible to\nsuch persons, the following shall be considered: (i) the extent to which medically underserved\npopulations currently use the applicant's services, where the applicant\ncurrently provides residential health care facility services, in comparison to\nthe percentage of all users of the service in the applicant's planning area or\nto which they are found in the population in general, and the extent to which\nmedically underserved populations are expected to use the proposed residential\nhealth care facility beds if approved; (ii)\nthe performance of the applicant, where\nthe applicant currently provides residential health care facility services, in\nmeeting its obligation under the applicable civil rights statutes prohibiting\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, handicap, sex and\nage; and\n(iii)\nthe extent to which\n\nMedicaid and medically indigent patients are or would be served by the\napplicant; (10)\nwhen the\nremaining public need identified in subdivision (g) of this section is not\nsufficient to permit the approval of all applications for residential health\ncare facility beds which are considered in the batch under consideration which\notherwise meet all statutory and regulatory criteria specified under the Public\n\nHealth Law, the proposals will be competitively reviewed. In the competitive\nreview process consideration will be given to those proposals which meet any or\nall of the following: (i) make a commitment\nto admit a percentage of patients who are Medicaid eligible or\n\nMedicare/Medicaid eligible in excess of that required under subdivision (m) of\nthis section; (ii)\nmake a\ncommitment to admit a percentage of patients who have been on alternate level\nof care status in a general hospital for more than 90 days. Additional\nconsideration will be given to applications that: (a) identify and agree to meet special\nprogram requirements for such patients; and\n(b) demonstrate that they have written\nagreements with general hospitals for admission of alternate level of care\npatients; (iii)\nagree in\nwriting to participate in available local long term care case management\nprograms. Existing written agreements with local case management programs\nshould be documented in the application; (iv)\npropose to establish or expand adult\ncare facility beds or other supportive housing programs; (v) provide an architectural design, as\ndemonstrated through room-by-room single line drawings and project narrative, that offers innovative designs and other factors (such as interior finishes, lighting, decorating and furnishings) to enhance quality of life in the\nfacility. (j) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, the applicant may\npropose a service area that includes a long term care planning area outside of\nthat in which the facility or proposed facility is located. If any application\nis approved on this basis, the number of residential health care facility bed\nresources available in the external planning area determined in accordance with\nsubdivision (g) of this section will be adjusted to reflect that portion of the\nfacility's bed complement which will serve residents of the external planning\narea. (k) Any application for\nconstruction wherein a determination of public need is made pursuant to this\nsection shall be subject to the provisions of section\n709.1\n(e) of this\n\nPart. (l) Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this section to the contrary, up to 300 additional residential\nhealth care facility beds for the State as a whole may be approved, which shall\nbe in additional to the total statewide number of residential health care\nfacility beds otherwise estimated to be needed under this section. Such\nadditional beds may be approved in response to applications to add a single bed\nor multiple beds to an existing facility, to add an extension unit to an\nexisting facility or to construct a new facility. Such additional beds may be\napproved only to meet emergency situations or other unanticipated\ncircumstances, which shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the\nfollowing: (1)\nnatural disasters, such as\nfloods, fires and disease outbreaks; (2)\nunanticipated changes in population\nmigration patterns or census growth; (3)\nunanticipated reduction in availability\nof alternative placement settings; and\n(4)\nunanticipated changes in population\nhealth or age group characteristics. (m) Any residential health care facility or\ngeneral hospital filing an application to add residential health care facility\nbeds shall be subject to the following requirements which shall apply to all of\nthe facility's existing and proposed certified residential health care beds: (1)\n\nIn determining the need for residential\nhealth care facilities, beds and services, consideration shall be given to the\nneeds of persons who receive or are eligible to receive medical assistance\nbenefits at the time of admission to a facility pursuant to title XIX of the\n\nFederal Social Security Act and title 11 of article 5 of the Social Services\n\nLaw, hereafter referred to as Medicaid patients, and the extent to which the\napplicant serves or proposes to serve such persons, as reflected by factors\nincluding, but not necessarily limited to, the applicant's admissions policies\nand practices. An application by an applicant that is or will be a provider\nthat participates in the medical assistance (Medicaid) program shall not be\napproved unless the applicant agrees to comply with the requirements of this\nsubdivision. An applicant that, at the time of consideration of its application\nby the commissioner, proposes not to participate in the Medicaid program may be\napproved, provided all other review criteria have been met, upon the condition\nthat if, in the future, it does participate in the Medicaid program, it would\ncomply fully with the requirements of this subdivision. (2)\n\nTo ensure that the needs of Medicaid\npatients in an applicant's service area are met and that such patients have\nadequate access to appropriate residential health care facilities, beds and\nservices, applicants shall be required to accept and admit at least a\nreasonable percentage of Medicaid patients as determined pursuant to this\nsubdivision. Such reasonable percentage of Medicaid patient admissions, also\nreferred to herein as the Medicaid patient admissions standard, shall be equal\nto 75 percent of the annual percentage of all residential health care facility\nadmissions, in the long term care planning area in which the applicant facility\nis located, that are Medicaid patients. The calculation of such planning area\npercentage shall not include admissions to residential health care facilities\nthat have an average length of stay of 30 days or less. If there are four or\nfewer residential health care facilities in a planning area, the applicable\n\nMedicaid patient admissions standard for such planning area shall be equal to\n75 percent of the planning area annual percentage of all residential health\ncare facility admissions that are Medicaid patients or 75 percent of the annual\npercentage of all residential health care facility admissions, in the health\nsystems agency area in which the facility is located, that are Medicaid\npatients, whichever is less. In calculating such percentages, the department\nwill use the most current admissions data which have been received and analyzed\nby the department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate\nadjustments in its admissions policies and practices so that the proportion of\nits own annual Medicaid patient admissions is at least equal to 75 percent of\nthe planning area percentage or health systems agency area percentage, whichever is applicable. (3)\n\nThe\nproportion of an applicant's admissions that must be Medicaid patients, as\ncalculated under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, may be increased or\ndecreased based on the following factors: (i) the number of individuals within the planning area currently awaiting placement\nto a residential health care facility and the proportion of total individuals\nawaiting such placement that are Medicaid patients, provided that patients\nawaiting placement include, but need not be limited to, alternate level of care\npatients in general hospitals; (ii)\nthe proportion of the facility's total patient days that are Medicaid patient\ndays and the length of time that the facility's patients who are admitted as\nprivate paying patients remain such before becoming Medicaid\neligible; (iii)\nthe proportion of\nthe facility's admissions who are Medicare patients or patients whose services\nare paid for under provisions of the Federal Veterans' Benefit Law; (iv)\nthe facility's patient case mix based on\nthe intensity of care required by the facility's patients or the extent to\nwhich the facility provides services to patients with unique or specialized\nneeds; and\n(v) the financial impact\non the facility due to an increase in Medicaid patient admissions. (4)\n(i) An applicant shall submit a written plan, subject to the approval of the department, for reaching the Medicaid patient\nadmissions standard required by this subdivision. The plan shall provide for\nreaching the standard within no longer than a two-year period and the facility\nshall give preference, as necessary, to Medicaid patients in order to reach the\nadmissions standard within the prescribed time period. (ii)\n\nOnce the Medicaid patient admissions\nstandard is reached, the facility shall not reduce its proportion of Medicaid\npatient admissions so as to go below the standard unless and until the\napplicant, in writing, requests the approval of the department to adjust the\nstandard and the department's written approval is obtained. In reviewing\nrequests to adjust a facility's Medicaid patient admissions standard, the\ndepartment shall consider factors which may include, but need not be limited\nto, those factors set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this\nsubdivision. (iii)\n\nAfter a\nfacility's initial Medicaid patient admissions standard has been reached, the\ndepartment may increase such facility's Medicaid patient admissions standard, based on the criteria set forth in this subdivision, if the percentage of\n\nMedicaid patients admitted by residential health care facilities in the\nfacility's planning area or health systems agency area, as appropriate, increases due to factors other than an increase in Medicaid patient admissions\nby the applicant. (5)\n(i) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, after the phase-in period provided for in paragraph (4)\nof this subdivision, a facility shall be prohibited from failing, refusing or\nneglecting to accept or admit a Medicaid patient for whom it is otherwise able\nto provide care, regardless of whether the level of reimbursement received for\nsuch patient is less than the rate the facility charges private pay patients, unless the facility has reached and is maintaining compliance with the Medicaid\npatient admissions standard imposed by this subdivision. Compliance with the\nrequirements of this subdivision shall be determined on the basis of a\nfacility's total annual admissions, so that a facility may exercise its\ndiscretion in determining when during a year it will admit a sufficient number\nof Medicaid patients to maintain its Medicaid patient admissions\nstandard. (ii)\nA facility may be\nexempt from the requirement of admitting a Medicaid patient in order to meet or\nmaintain its Medicaid patient admissions standard if it can demonstrate in\nwriting to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the Medicaid patient was\ndenied admission solely in order to admit another patient who had a greater\nneed of residential health care facility services, as determined by the\nintensity of care anticipated to be required by such patient, and that there\nwas only one bed available in the facility at the time of the admission\ndecision to accommodate a new admission. Facilities shall not be required to\nobtain prior department approval in order to accept a non-Medicaid patient in\nplace of a Medicaid patient pursuant to this subparagraph, but shall maintain\nsufficient documentation including, but not necessarily limited to, a copy of\nthe patient review instrument for the patient admitted and the Medicaid patient\ndenied admission in order to justify the admission decision. Copies of such\ndocumentation shall be provided to the department upon request. (6)\n\nIf any provision of this\nsubdivision or the application thereof is held invalid, the remainder of this\nsubdivision and the application thereof to other circumstances shall not be\naffected by such holding and shall remain in full force and effect.
