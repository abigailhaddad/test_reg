  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 364.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe sections of the Retirement and Social Security which\nprovide the eligibility requirements for disability retirement benefits require\napplicants to be permanently incapacitated for the performance of duty. It is\nclear under the pertinent statutory provisions and case law that the issue of\npermanent incapacity must be determined on the basis of the individual's own\nactual duties. In 1994, the Comptroller commissioned Buck Consultants, Inc. (\"Buck\"), to study and make recommendations with respect to the Retirement\n\nSystems' disability retirement programs. This study involved analyses of the\nprograms of many other public systems, and also involved analysis of testimony\ntaken at public meetings conducted by Buck throughout the State. A report of\nthe study's findings and recommendations was issued by Buck on February 1, 1995. This report found that one of the most significant issues which emerged\nduring the course of the public meetings is how the Retirement System should\ndetermine the issue of permanent incapacity with respect to disability\nretirement applicants (especially police officers and firefighters) who, although permanently disabled from their former full duties are, in fact, performing light duty, limited duty or restricted duty assignments as the case\nmay be (\"light duty cases\"). Buck further found that some misunderstanding\nexists, among both participating employers and employees, regarding the\n\nSystem's policy for determining the permanent incapacity issue in cases where\nthe individual had been assigned to light, limited or restricted duties at the\ntime of or prior to the filing of the disability retirement application. The Buck report included a recommendation that the System\npromulgate a regulation which would set forth its policy for determining the\npermanent incapacity issue in light duty cases and clarify the significance of\nan applicant having performed overtime work in the months and years immediately\npreceding the filing of the disability retirement application. This part sets\nforth the rules and standards to be applied by the Retirement System with\nrespect to determining the issue of permanent incapacity in such cases. This\npart also guides the employer with respect to providing the pertinent\ninformation regarding job requirements, in order to facilitate the Retirement\n\nSystem's attempts to apply such rules and standards. For the purposes of this part, the term applicant shall mean\na member of the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System or the\n\nNew York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System who is the subject\nof an application for disability retirement filed with the Retirement System\neither by such member, the member's employer or an individual legally\nauthorized to file such application on behalf of the member.
