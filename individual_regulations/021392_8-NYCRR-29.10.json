Independence will be considered to be impaired if the licensee, a partner in the firm or a member of his or her or the partner's immediate\nfamily, is or has been a director or officer of the enterprise, or is or has\nbeen involved in any situation creating a conflict of interest, during the\nperiod covered by the examination or at the time of issuance of a\nreport; (6)\noffering or rendering\nprofessional services under a contingency fee arrangement when serving a client\nfor whom the licensee performs: an audit or review of a financial statement; or\na compilation of a financial statement when the licensee knows or has reason to\nknow that a third party will use the financial statement and the licensee's\ncompilation report does not disclose a lack of independence; or an examination\nof prospective financial information; or an original or amended tax return or\nclaim for a tax refund; or any public accounting services for a client during\nthe period in which the licensee is engaged in the foregoing services for that\nclient or for any period covered by historical financial statements involving\nsuch foregoing services.

Fees charged may vary depending on the complexity of the\nservice rendered; (7)\npermitting\nthe public accountant's name to be associated with statements purporting to\nshow financial position or results of operations in such a manner as to imply\nthat he or she is acting as an independent certified public accountant or\npublic accountant, unless: (i) the licensee\nhas complied with generally accepted auditing standards. The State Board for\n\nPublic Accountancy may consider statements on auditing standards promulgated by\nthe United States Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company\n\nAccounting Oversight Board for licensees subject to such requirements, or a\nrecognized national accountancy organization whose standards are generally\naccepted by other regulatory authorities in the United States, including but\nnot limited to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to be\ninterpretations of generally accepted auditing standards.

In addition, it\nshall include any records, tax returns, reports, or other documents and\ninformation which are contained in an accountant's working papers that were\nprepared for the client by the accountant and for which the accountant has\nreceived payment from the client; (v) after the licensee has complied with the\nforegoing requirements by providing information to a client, it shall not\nconstitute unprofessional conduct for an accountant to refuse to provide the\nsame information to the client pursuant to a subsequent request by that\nclient; (vi)\nthis paragraph shall\napply in lieu of section\n29.1\n(b)(7)\nof this\n\nPart; (9)\npermitting any\npartner, or employee acting as such, to perform any service for his or her\nclient which the licensee or the firm is not permitted to perform; (10)\nsoliciting or advertising for clients in\nviolation of section\n29.1\n(b)(12)\nof\nthis Part, which shall be interpreted as follows: soliciting and advertising\nnot in the public interest shall include, but not be limited to, obtaining\nclients through any other corporation or business used as a \"feeder\"; using the\ntitle of certified public accountant or public accountant together with that of\nany other business or occupation on any letterhead, card, circular or other\nmedia, if the certified public accountant or public accountant conjointly\nengages in such business or occupation with his or her public accounting\npractice; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit a certified\npublic accountant or public accountant licensed to practice another profession\nfrom including such professional designation on his or her letterhead or\nbusiness card or upon any listing or other designation of his or her\noffice; (11)\nfailing to maintain\nand/or make available to the department work papers in accordance with the\nrequirements of this paragraph.
