  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.187 - Vaults: sealing, venting and ventilation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each underground vault or closed top pit\ncontaining either a pressure regulating or reducing station, or a pressure\nlimiting or relieving station, must be sealed, vented or ventilated. (b) When the internal volume exceeds 200\ncubic feet (5.66 cubic meters), each of the following apply: (1)\n\nThe vault or pit must be ventilated with\ntwo ducts, each having at least the ventilating effect of a pipe four inches\n(102 millimeters) in diameter. (2)\n\nThe ventilation must be enough to minimize the formation of combustible\natmosphere in the vault or pit. (3)\n\nThe ducts must be high enough above grade to disperse any gas-air mixtures that\nmight be discharged. (c) When the internal volume is more than 75 cubic feet (2.12 cubic meters) but\nless than 200 cubic feet (5.66 cubic meters), the following apply: (1)\n\nIf the vault or pit is sealed, each\nopening must have a tight-fitting cover without open holes through which an\nexplosive mixture might be ignited, and there must be a means for testing the\ninternal atmosphere before removing the cover. (2)\n\nIf the vault or pit is vented, there must\nbe a means of preventing external sources of ignition from reaching the vault\natmosphere. (3)\n\nIf the vault or pit\nis ventilated, subdivision (b) or (d) of this section applies. (d) If a vault or pit covered by\nsubdivision (c) of this section is ventilated by openings in the covers or\ngratings and the ratio of the internal volume, in cubic feet, to the effective\nventilating area of the cover or grating, in square feet, is less than 20 to 1, no additional ventilation is required. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.187\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
