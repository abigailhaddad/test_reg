Tit. 9 §§ 1640-4.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe term indeterminate expenditure refers to those\nexpenditures made by a local agency with respect to a planned or proposed\nproject prior to the date of the duly executed and approved contract for State\naid for that project. This date has previously been defined as marking the\nbeginning of the development period. Funds advanced or to be advanced by the\n\nState may not be used to meet indeterminate expenditures, and the local agency\nmust look to other sources for its funds. Such other sources may, however, upon\nexecution and approval of the contract for State aid and after audit, review, and approval of the expenditures by the division, be reimbursed, out of loan\nfunds advanced or to be advanced by the State, for such expenditures as are\napproved by the division as being eligible charges to the development cost of\nthe project. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-4.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
