(c) Notwithstanding that a surgical procedure is consistent with the guidelines, a\nsecond or subsequent performance of such surgical procedure shall require a\nPAR: special services if it is repeated because of the failure or incomplete\nsuccess of the same surgical procedure performed earlier, and if the medical\ntreatment guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures. (d) This section shall not apply to prior\nauthorization requests from the formulary, as set forth in Part 441 of this\nchapter, or the durable medical equipment fee schedule, as set forth in Part\n442 of this chapter. (ii)\nA PAR must be requested and granted by the carrier, selfinsured employer, or\nthird-party administrator, the Board or order of the Chair before medical care\nthat varies from the Medical Treatment Guidelines or special service is\nprovided to the claimant and the carrier, self-insured employer, or third-party\nadministrator may deny the PAR and deny payment of the treatment requested if\nthe treatment is rendered prior to the PAR being granted by the carrier, self-insured employer, third-party administrator, the Board or order of the\n\nChair. (iii)\n\nFor the purposes of\nthis section, a treating medical provider shall not include a physician\nassistant, acupuncturist, physical therapist, or occupational therapist, as\ndefined in section 13-b. (b) Insurance carriers, self-insured\nemployers, and third-party administrators. (1)\n\nInsurance carriers, self-insured\nemployers, or third-party administrators shall provide the Chair or his or her\ndesignee in the manner prescribed by the Chair with the name and contact\ninformation for the point(s) of contact for PAR review. Such contact\ninformation may include the contacts' direct telephone number(s) and email\naddress(es). (i) If the designated point(s)\nof contact changes at any time for any reason, the insurance carrier, self-insured employer, or third-party administrator shall notify the Chair or\nhis or her designee of such change in the manner prescribed by the\n\nChair. (ii)\n\nThe list of designated\npoints of contact for each insurance carrier, self-insured employer, or\nthird-party administrator shall be maintained by the Board electronically. When\na treating medical provider submits a PAR electronically, it shall be directed\nto the appropriate contact person. Any change in the designated contact shall\nnot be effective until the designated contact information has been updated in\nthe Board's electronic records. (iii)\n\nIn the event that a carrier, self-insured employer, or third-party administrator fails to so provide the\n\nChair or his or her designee with such name and contact information (in the\nmanner prescribed), or provides incorrect or incomplete contact information\nduring initial registration or when updating pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, such carrier may be subject to: (a) Orders of the Chair granting any PAR\nsubmitted during such time when the name and contact information is missing, incomplete or incorrect; and\n(b) Penalties issued pursuant to section\n114-a\n(3)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law for\nevery case, where a PAR was submitted. (2)\n\nReview by insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer, or third-party administrator. When an insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer, or third-party administrator denies or partially approves a PAR, the\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer, or third-party administrator must\nalso assert any other basis for denial or such basis for denial will be deemed\nwaived. Except as set forth in subdivision (b) below, all denials or partial\napprovals must be made by the Carrier's Physician. A partial approval limits\nthe length of time or frequency of the treatment, or authorizes a related but\ndifferent treatment than that requested in the PAR. (i) Without IME or review of records. (a) The insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer, or third party administrator shall review the PAR and respond to the\nrequest in the format prescribed by the chair within 15 calendar days of\nreceipt, except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. Receipt is\ndeemed to be the date submitted. (1)\n\nIn the\nevent the PAR is submitted after the mandatory first report of injury pursuant\nto section\n300.22\n(b) of this\n\nChapter shall become due and no such report has been filed, the Board may issue\nan Order of the Chair granting the requested treatment. (b) In the following circumstances a PAR may\nbe denied without an opinion by the Carrier's Physician or an IME or review of\nrecords. (1)\n\nIf the PAR was submitted after\nthe medical care was rendered, a medical opinion by the Carrier's Physician, a\nreview of records, or independent medical examination is not required and the\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer or third party administrator may deny\nthe PAR on the basis that it was not requested before the medical care was\nprovided. (2)\n\nThe insurance\ncarrier, self-insured employer, or third-party administrator may deny a PAR on\nthe basis that: (i) the treating medical\nprovider seeks a PAR for a treatment, procedure or test that is substantially\nsimilar to a prior request from the treating medical provider that has not yet\nbeen denied by the carrier, self-insured employer or third party administrator; or\n(ii)\nthat a prior substantially\nsimilar request has been denied, and the subsequent request does not contain\nany additional documentation or justification to the previous request. The\ncarrier self-insured employer or third-party administrator may deny the PAR by\nspecifying the basis for the denial. The carrier self-insured employer or\nthird-party administrator may submit the denial without a medical opinion by\n\nCarrier's Physician's or independent medical examination. (3)\n\nIf a case is closed, disallowed or\ncancelled, where ongoing medical treatment is resolved by an agreement pursuant\nto section\n32\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law, subject to an offset pursuant to an approved\nthird-party settlement in accordance with section\n29\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law, or controverted in accordance with section\n300.22\n(b)(1)(ii) or\n(c)(1)\nof this Chapter, or when a claimant\nfails to appear for a scheduled IME as set forth in (b)(ii)(2) herein, the\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator may deny\na PAR without review by the Carrier's Physician, or an independent medical\nexamination. (i) Nothing herein shall\nprohibit a carrier from seeking review of a PAR by a Carrier's Physician or\nindependent medical examiner. (ii)\n\nWhen a PAR is denied without review by Carrier's Physician in accordance with\nsubdivision (b) herein, there shall be no review by the Medical Director's\n\nOffice. A claimant may request review by the Board by filing a Request for\n\nFurther Action, that demonstrates that the basis for denial is factually\ninaccurate. The Board may respond to such requests for review by letter or by\nreferral to adjudication, as appropriate in the discretion of the Chair or his\nor her designee. (c) A denial or partial approval of the\nrequest for a variance for reasons other than those set forth in clause (a) of\nthis subparagraph, including a denial for failure of the medical provider to\nmeet the burden of proof that the PAR was appropriate for the claimant and\nmedically necessary, or an approval that concedes medical necessity but does\nnot affirm that the approved medical care will be paid at the fee schedule\nrate, must be reviewed by the Carrier's Physician, if an independent medical\nexamination or review of records is not conducted as set forth in this\nparagraph. A denial or partial approval issued by other than a Carrier's\n\nPhysician is not valid and may be deemed approved by the Board. Invalid denials\nmay be subject to penalties pursuant to sections\n13-a\n(6)(a)\nand\n114-a\n(3)\nof the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw. (d) The carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third-party administrator shall send the claimant notice of the\napproval, partial approval or denial of the PAR. Failure to send the claimant\nsuch notice may result in penalties under section 25(3)(e), for failure to file\na required report with the Board, and section\n13-a\n(6)(a)\nof the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw\n(ii)\n\nReview with IME\nor review of records. (a) If the insurance\ncarrier, self-insured employer, or third party administrator wants an\nindependent medical examination conducted of the claimant or a review of\nrecords in order to respond to the variance request, it shall provide\nnotification of this decision in the format prescribed by the Chair which may\nbe electronic within five business days of receipt of the PAR. A final response\nto the PAR shall be submitted in the format prescribed by the Chair which may\nbe electronic within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request. (b) If the claimant fails to appear without\nreasonable cause for an independent medical examination scheduled by the\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator in order\nto respond to a PAR, the request for a variance shall be denied. The insurance\ncarrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator shall submit the\nresponse to the PAR within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request. Receipt\nis determined as provided in clause (a) of this subparagraph. If the claimant\nrequests review of the denial of the PAR based on his or her failure to appear, such request for review shall be reviewed by the Board in the manner prescribed\nby the Chair. Such request for review of the denial of the PAR shall be\nsubmitted in the manner prescribed by the Chair within 21 business days of\nreceipt of the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator 's denial by the claimant. If the claimant requests review of the\ndenial of the PAR and it is determined that the failure to appear was for\nreasonable grounds, the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third party\nadministrator will have 30 calendar days from the date of the filing of the\ndecision to obtain an independent medical examination or 15 calendar days if\nproceeding in accordance with paragraph (i) herein, and provide a further\nresponse to the response to PAR. (3)\n\nInsurance carrier, Self-insured employer\nor Third party administrator, response to PAR. (i) The PAR response shall be in the format\nprescribed by the Chair and shall clearly state whether the PAR has been\ngranted, denied, granted with respect to medical necessity but liability for\npayment is withheld, or partially granted. If a PAR has been partially granted, the response shall specify the medical treatment, procedure or test that has\nbeen granted. (ii)\n\nIf the insurance\ncarrier, self-insured employer or third party administrator denies a PAR, it\nshall state the basis for the denial in detail and, if for reasons other than\nthose set forth in clause (2)(i)(b) or (c) or (2)(ii)(b) of this subdivision, submit with its response the written report of the Carrier's Physician that\nreviewed the PAR. When the denial is based on an independent medical\nexamination, the denial shall identify the independent medical examination\nreport or review of records report, if already submitted to the Board, by the\ndocument identification number in the electronic case folder and date received\nby the Board. The insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator may submit citations or copies of relevant literature published\nin recognized, peer-reviewed medical journals in support of a denial of a PAR. If the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator\nconcedes the medical necessity of the medical care, it may grant without\nliability, only if the case has been controverted in accordance with section\n300.22\n(b)(1)(ii) or\n(c)(1)\nof this Chapter, or the medical care\nis for a body part or condition that has not been accepted by the insurance\ncarrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator or established by\nthe Board. (iii)\n\nWhen a PAR is\ndenied without review by Carrier's Physician in accordance with subdivision (b)\nherein, there shall be no review by the Medical Director's Office. A claimant\nmay request review by the Board by filing a Request for Further Action, that\ndemonstrates that the basis for denial is factually inaccurate. The Board may\nrespond to such requests for review by letter or by referral to adjudication, as appropriate in the discretion of the Chair or his or her\ndesignee. (4)\n\nIf a claim\nis controverted or the time to controvert the claim has not expired, and the\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer, or third party administrator grants\nor partially grants a PAR, such grant is limited to the question of\nappropriateness for the claimant and medical necessity, and it shall not be\nconstrued as an admission that the condition for which the PAR is requested is\ncompensable and the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third party\nadministrator is not liable for the cost of such treatment unless the claim or\ncondition is established. (5)\n\nUnless the insurance carrier, self-insured employer, or third-party\nadministrator has properly denied or granted as to medical necessity but\nwithheld liability for the claim, the carrier may not thereafter object to\npayment for such medical care at the fee schedule rate and any such objections\nwill be rejected by the Board and applicable penalties\nimposed. (c) Request for\nreview of denial of a PAR. Upon receipt of the denial of a PAR by Carrier's\n\nPhysician or by an Independent Medical Examination, the treating medical\nprovider may request review of the denial by the Medical Director's Office as\nset forth in subdivision (d) herein. A request for review of the denial of the\nPAR shall be submitted within 10 calendar days of the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator 's denial. The request shall\nbe made in the format prescribed by the Chair and provide all information\nrequested. When a denial is not based on a claimant's failure to appear for an\nindependent medical examination pursuant to subparagraph (2)(ii)(b) of this\nsection and the treating medical provider seeks review of such denial, the\ntreating medical provider may request review of the PAR denial through the\nprocess set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. If the request is not\nreceived by the Board within 10 calendar days of receipt of the denial, the\ndenial of the PAR will be deemed final. A claimant may request review of a\ndenial of a PAR by an independent medical examination in accordance with\nparagraph (d)(3) herein. (d) Process for requesting review of denial of PARs except denials based on the\nclaimant's failure to appear for an IME. 1. All requests for review of denials or partial approvals of a PAR by a Carrier's\n\nPhysician shall be submitted to the Medical Director's Office in the format\nprescribed by the Chair. 2. When a\ndenial is based on a reason set forth in (b)(2)(i)(b), in addition to a\n\nCarrier's Physician review, the request for review shall be submitted to the\n\nMedical Director's Office. 3. When\na denial or partial approval is based upon an independent medical examination, the medical provider may request review by the Medical Director's Office unless\na request for further action through adjudication is filed by the claimant. In\nthe event a decision is rendered by the Medical Director's Office, the claimant\nretains the rights set forth in subparagraph (7) herein. 4. The Chair or Medical Director may\ndesignate private entities to evaluate such requests for review of denials by\nthe carrier's physician provided that the entity has: i. the appropriate URAC accreditation or such\naccreditation/certification as designated by the Chair, ii. other demonstrated expertise and criteria\nestablished by the Board; and\niii. no conflict of interest exists in resolving the subject dispute. 5. When a medical provider wishes\nto request review of a denial or partial approval of a PAR, the medical\nprovider shall submit the request to the Medical Director's Office in the\nformat prescribed by the Chair within 10 calendar days of the denial date\ntogether with all documentation submitted in support of its initial request, and the denial or partial approval issued following request. 6. A decision by the Medical Director's\n\nOffice (or designated accredited entity) is final and binding on the medical\nprovider, and upon the carrier for issues related to medical necessity. Such\ndecision shall be binding and not appealable under Workers' Compensation Law\nsection 23. 7. Notwithstanding\nparagraph (5) and (6) herein, a claimant may request review of a Medical\n\nDirector's Office decision or a denial by Carrier's Physician by filing a\n\nRequest for Further Action that demonstrates that such treatment is medically\nnecessary. A Request for Further Action following denial by a Carrier's\n\nPhysician shall render a request for review by the Medical Provider to the\n\nMedical Director's Office moot. Decision on the denial will be made in\n\nAdjudication. The Board may respond to such requests for review by letter or by\nreferral to adjudication, including the expedited hearing process, as\nappropriate in the discretion of the Chair or his or her designee. 8. If the insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer, or third party administrator fails to respond to the PAR, fails to\ntimely deny the PAR in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section, or, except if the basis for the denial is one of the reasons set forth in clause\n(b)(2)(i)(b) or (c) or subdivision ( a) of this section, fails to submit the\nwritten report, or identify the report in the electronic case folder, the\nvariance may be deemed approved on the ground that such approval was\nunreasonably withheld and the Chair will issue an order stating that the\nrequest is approved and the carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator shall be subject to a penalty pursuant to section\n25\n(3)(e)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. Such\norder of the Chair is not appealable under Workers' Compensation Law section\n23. When a substantially similar PAR has been submitted in violation of\nparagraph (a)(7) of this section, the failure of the carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third party administrator to timely deny such request shall not\nresult in the PAR being deemed approved and the Chair is not required to issue\nan order stating that the request is approved. 9. When the Chair issues an order as provided\nin paragraph (8) of this subdivision in a claim that is controverted or the\ntime to controvert the claim has not expired, the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third party administrator shall not be responsible for\nthe payment of such medical care until the question of compensability is\nresolved and then only if that insurance carrier,, self-insured employer or\nthird party administrator is found liable for the claim.
