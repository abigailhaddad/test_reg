  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4820.57 - Bonus ball\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nBonus ball may be conducted during single\noccasions, and during each occasion of multiple occasion bingo sessions known\nas double headers and triple headers, as described in subdivision (b) of this\nsection, provided the licensed authorized organization adheres to all of the\nprovisions of this Chapter related to the determination of the bonus ball\nnumber, the sale of opportunities to enroll in bonus ball, and the\nestablishment, awarding, or carrying-over of the bonus ball prize. (2)\n\nThe bonus ball number is determined for\neach occasion by the bingo caller's drawing of a bingo ball from the\nreceptacle, the caller's announcement that the ball drawn is the bonus ball\nnumber for that occasion only, the prominent posting of the bonus ball number\nin an area of the bingo premises visible to the majority of players, and the\nimmediate return of that ball to the receptacle. The bonus ball number must be\ndetermined, announced and prominently posted prior to the start of the first\nbingo game in each occasion and remain posted throughout all bingo games during\nsuch occasion. (3)\n\nTo be eligible\nto participate in bonus ball, each player must pay a fee for that opportunity\nprior to the start of the first bingo game in an occasion wherein bonus ball\nwill be played. To verify payment, the player shall be issued a bonus ball\nreceipt unique to that occasion, or some similar method of verifying payment\nmust be used, such as stamping the player's hand with ink, or indelibly marking\ntheir bingo cards to reflect payment. (4)\n\nThe fee for a single opportunity to\nparticipate in bonus ball, which cannot exceed $1, entitles each participating\nplayer to compete in all bingo games conducted during an occasion that are\nspecified as bonus ball games in the authorized organization's application for\nbingo license, and on the bingo program. (5)\n\nAll sales of opportunities to play bonus\nball must cease prior to the caller's announcement of the total amount\ncollected from the sale of opportunities to participate in bonus ball and the\namount of the bonus ball prize. (6)\n\nThe total amount collected from the sale of opportunities to participate in\nbonus ball and the amount of the bonus ball prize must be announced by the\ncaller at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the first bingo game\ndesignated as a bonus ball game in each occasion. (7)\n\nIf a winner of a designated bonus ball\ngame is verified, a bonus ball prize consistent with paragraph (8) of this\nsubdivision shall be awarded to the winning player, and the caller shall\ndeclare the bonus ball game closed for the remainder of that bingo\noccasion. (8)\n\nEach winner of a\nbonus ball game shall be awarded a cash prize equal to a percentage of the\nproceeds collected from the sale of opportunities to participate in bonus ball, which cannot exceed 75 percent of the proceeds derived from such sales. The\nremaining percentage of the proceeds from those sales, which cannot be less\nthan 25 percent, is retained by the licensed authorized organization as profit. The percentage of sales used to calculate bonus ball prizes must be\nconsistently applied at all occasions, as specified in the licensed authorized\norganization's application for bingo license, on the license, and on the bingo\nprogram. (9)\n\nIf there is no winner\nduring a bingo occasion in which opportunities to play bonus ball are sold, the\nbonus ball prize money is carried-over and added to the specified percentage of\nthe proceeds derived from the sale of bonus ball opportunities during each\nsubsequent bingo occasion, until a winner is determined and the bonus ball\nprize is awarded; provided, however, pursuant to General Municipal Law section\n476(1)(11-b), no bonus ball prize can exceed the sum of $6,000. When a bonus\nball prize reaches $6,000, that prize must remain at $6,000 until a winner is\ndetermined. All proceeds from the sale of opportunities collected after a bonus\nball prize has reached $6,000 shall be retained by the licensed authorized\norganization as profit until the $6,000 bonus ball prize is awarded, at which\ntime the caller shall declare the bonus ball game closed for the remainder of\nthat bingo occasion. (10)\n\nAlthough\nthe prizes awarded in bonus ball games comprise a predetermined percentage of\nthe proceeds collected from the sale of opportunities identical to the prizes\nawarded in early bird bingo games conducted pursuant to section\n4820.50\nof this Part, early bird\nand bonus ball are two distinctly separate bingo games. Authorized\norganizations may be licensed to conduct two early bird games per occasion and\ncan also designate any or all of the regular and/or special bingo games\nconducted during that occasion to be bonus ball games. (11)\n\nAlthough the prizes awarded in Bonus\n\nBall games are comprised of a predetermined percentage of the proceeds\ncollected from the sale of opportunities identical to the prizes awarded in\nearly bird bingo games defined in section\n4800.1\n(h) and\nconducted pursuant to section\n4820.50\nof this Part, early bird\nand bonus ball are two distinctly separate bingo games. Authorized\norganizations may be licensed to conduct two early bird games per occasion and\ncan also designate any or all of the regular and/or special bingo games\nconducted during that occasion to be bonus ball games. (b) Opportunities to participate in both\noccasions of a double-header or all three occasions of a triple-header session\nmay be sold prior to the first occasion in such sessions, so long as: (1)\nthe proceeds from the total sales of\nbonus ball opportunities are, prior to the start of the first occasion, divided\ninto two equal parts for a double header and three equal parts for a triple\nheader, and that those parts shall be subdivided according to the percentages\nspecified on the application for the bingo license to form the percentage of\nsuch funds to be retained by the licensee as the profit for each occasion, and\nthe percentage of the proceeds to be available as separate prizes in each of\nthe occasions in the session, and\n(2)\nthe bonus ball number must be determined\nby a drawing of a bingo ball from the bingo receptacle, and such number must be\nannounced, prominently posted in the area of the bingo premises occupied by the\nmajority of players and be returned to the receptacle prior to the start of the\nfirst bingo game in each occasion in which bonus ball is conducted, unless the\napplication for bingo license specifies that the bonus ball number drawn prior\nto the first game in the first occasion of a double header or triple header\nsession shall be designated the bonus ball number for all of the occasions\nconducted during that session.
