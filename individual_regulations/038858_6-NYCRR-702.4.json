  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 702.4 - Procedures for deriving standards and guidance values based on oncogenic effects\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Standards\nand guidance values based on oncogenic effects shall be calculated using\ndose-response data from scientifically valid human or animal studies. Considering factors including but not limited to route, duration and timing of\nexposure, species, strain, tumor types and sites, nature and severity of\neffects, pharmacokinetics, mode-of-action, study quality, and statistical\nsignificance, the dose-response data deemed to be the most appropriate for\nevaluating potential human health risks at environmental exposures shall be\nused as the basis of the value. (b) Standards and guidance values shall be based on the point-of-departure for the\nselected dose-response data. (1)\n\nThe\npoint-of-departure shall be the LED10, which is the 95 percent lower confidence\nlimit on the dose associated with 10 percent excess risk for oncogenic effects\nadjusted for background risk. A different level of excess risk may be used if\ndeemed more appropriate based on scientific evidence. (2)\n\nThe point-of-departure shall be estimated\nusing a validated, biologically-based dose-response model. If such a model does\nnot exist, the point-of-departure shall be estimated using a mathematical model\n(i.e., the multistage, probit, logistic, or Weibull model) that best describes\nthe dose-response data within the range of observation. Statistical measures, including the Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, shall be used to determine\nwhich model best describes the data. (3)\n\nIf the selected dose-response data are\nnot adequately described by methods in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, an\nalternative point-of-departure (e.g., a NOEL or LOEL) shall be used. (c) If the point-of-departure is\nderived from an animal study, the human equivalent dose (milligrams of\nsubstance per kilogram of body weight per day) at the point-of-departure shall\nbe estimated by multiplying the animal-to-human body weight ratio raised to the\n0.25 power by the animal dose in milligrams of substance per kilogram of body\nweight per day. An alternative trans-species conversion method may be used if\ndeemed more appropriate based on scientific evidence. (d) The standard or guidance value shall be\nderived by extrapolating from the point-of-departure to the human dose at the\nstandard or guidance value. (1)\n\nIf a validated\nbiologically-based dose-response model is used to estimate the\npoint-of-departure, the standard or guidance value shall be based on the 95\npercent lower confidence limit on the human dose corresponding to an excess\nlifetime cancer risk of one-in-one million and shall be estimated using the\nmodel. If such a model is not available or is not validated for humans, the\nextrapolation method from the point-of-departure to the human dose at the\nstandard or guidance value shall depend on the results of a mode-of-action\nanalysis. (2)\n\nIf data on\nmode-of-action are unavailable, or if the mode-of-action analysis provides\nevidence of linearity at low doses or does not provide unequivocal evidence of\nnonlinearity at low doses, the standard or guidance value shall be based on the\n95 percent lower confidence limit on the human dose corresponding to an excess\nlifetime cancer risk of one-in-one million. The human dose at the standard or\nguidance value shall be estimated by multiplying the human equivalent dose at\nthe point-of-departure derived according to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this\nsection by a factor equal to the risk level of one-in-one million divided by\nthe risk level at the point-of-departure. (3)\n\nIf a mode-of-action analysis provides no\nevidence for linearity at low doses and provides unequivocal evidence of\nnonlinearity at low doses, the standard or guidance value shall be based on the\nhuman equivalent dose at the point-of-departure identified by the methods in\nsubdivision (b) of this section divided by an uncertainty factor that will\ninsure that the human dose at the standard or guidance value will be without\nappreciable risk to the human population, including children. The magnitude of\nthis factor will generally range from 10 to 3,000. Factors that will be\nconsidered in determining the magnitude of the uncertainty factor shall\ninclude: the nature of the dose-response curve and the point-of-departure; the\nrelative sensitivities of experimental animals and humans; the nature and\nextent of human variation, including age-dependent differences in sensitivity\nduring a lifetime; and the data gaps in the toxicological database. (e) Standards and guidance values\nbased on the 95 percent lower confidence limit on the human dose corresponding\nto an excess lifetime cancer risk of one-in-one million shall be derived using\nage-specific body weights for a lifetime exposure period of 70 years if\nscientific evidence is sufficient to show that children may be more sensitive\nthan adults to the oncogenic effect. If such evidence is not available, a body\nweight of 70 kilograms and a lifetime exposure period of 70 years shall be\nused. (f) Standards and guidance\nvalues based on the human equivalent dose at the point-of-departure divided by\nan uncertainty factor shall allow no more than 20 percent of the human dose at\nthe standard or guidance value to come from drinking water and shall be derived\nusing age-specific body weights for a childhood exposure period (18 years or\nless) if scientific evidence is sufficient to show that children may be more\nsensitive than adults to the oncogenic effect. If such evidence is not\navailable, a body weight of 70 kilograms shall be used. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
