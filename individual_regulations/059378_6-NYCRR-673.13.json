  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 673.13 - Engineering assessments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nowner of a dam that been assigned a hazard classification of class B or C shall\nperform engineering assessments on a regular basis, as is set forth in this\nsection. (b) The department may\nrequire an engineering assessment from the owner of a dam that has been\nassigned a condition rating of \"unsafe\" or \"unsound\", based on the department's\nconsideration of public safety and the specific characteristics of the dam and\nits location. (c) All engineering\nassessments shall be performed on behalf of the owner by a professional\nengineer, who shall document the results of the inspection in an engineering\nassessment report, which shall be signed and sealed by the professional\nengineer. (d) An engineering\nassessment shall be performed, and an engineering assessment report submitted\nto the dam safety section, at a minimum frequency of every 10 years for dams\nthat have been assigned a hazard classification of class B or C. (e) Unless a shorter time frame is imposed by\nthe department in the interest of public safety based on the assignment of a\ncondition rating of \"unsafe\" or \"unsound\" in accordance with section\n673.16\nof this Part, the schedule\nfor submission of the first engineering assessment report is as follows. (1)\n\nLarge class C dams. For dams that have\nbeen assigned a hazard classification of class C as of the effective date of\nthis Part, the first engineering assessment report shall be submitted within\nthree years of the effective date of this Part if the dam is a large class C\ndam, which shall mean the dam either has a height greater than or equal to 40\nfeet or impounds 1,000 acre-feet or more at normal water surface. (2)\n\nSmall class C dams. For dams that have\nbeen assigned a hazard classification of class C as of the effective date of\nthis Part, the first engineering assessment report shall be submitted within\nfive years of the effective date of this Part if the dam is a small class C\ndam, which shall mean the dam has a height of less than 40 feet and impounds\nless than 1,000 acre-feet at normal water surface. (3)\n\nClass B dams. For dams that have been\nassigned a hazard classification of class B as of the effective date of this\n\nPart, the first engineering assessment shall be submitted within six years of\nthe effective date of this Part. (4)\n\nFor dams that are assigned a hazard\nclassification of B or C or are reclassified as such after the effective date\nof this Part, the first engineering assessment report or other submission in\nlieu thereof, shall be submitted either: (i) as part of a permit application pursuant to Part 608 of this Title with respect\nto the dam; or\n(ii)\nwhere no\nactivities requiring a permit are pursued, within two years of the department's\nassignment. (5)\n\nThe\ndeadlines for the submission of the first engineering assessment report may be\nextended, at the discretion of the department, in response to a written request\nby a dam owner who is operating a dam in a safe condition and is not otherwise\nin violation of this Part. (f) All engineering assessments shall\ninclude: (1)\na complete safety inspection\npursuant to section\n673.12\nof this Part and a\ncorresponding safety inspection report; (2)\nan evaluation of the dam, including its\nfunction, structural stability, and spillway capacity, that may utilize\ncalculations or computer modeling of the hydrologic, hydraulic, stability\nand/or structural analysis; conclusions as to whether the dam is in a safe\ncondition; and the basis for the conclusions; and\n(3)\nany recommended change in the hazard\nclassification or modification of the emergency action plan due to changes in\nthe dam or inundation area, including, specifically, changes in land\nuse. (g) All engineering\nassessment reports shall be retained by the dam owner and kept in good\norder. (h) The department may\nreview any engineering assessment report at any time to protect life, property\nor natural resources, may require additional information or clarification\nthereto, and/or may provide comments to be addressed in a revised engineering\nassessment report upon a finding that it was not prepared in compliance with\nthis Part and/or generally accepted engineering practice in the field of dam\ndesign and safety. The owner shall revise the engineering assessment report to\nfully incorporate and/or resolve the department's comments and resubmit it to\nthe department within 60 days of the owner's receipt of the department's\ncomments, unless another time frame is either requested by the owner and agreed\nto by the department, or imposed by the department in the interests of public\nsafety for a dam that has a condition rating of \"unsafe\" or\n\"unsound\".
