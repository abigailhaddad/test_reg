  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.17 - Supplemental pension benefits\n\nState Regulations\nA savings bank inquired whether Section\n250\n(5)\nof the Banking Law requires its trustees\nto determine whether a supplemental benefit should be paid for any given year\nin the year in question or whether the trustees may adopt an automatic plan for\nsupplemental benefits, the amount of which would be determined on the basis of\nthe applicable cost-of-living index as provided in subdivision 5, without the\nnecessity of making a specific determination for each year for which benefits\nare to be supplemented. The Department responded that the statute does not require a\nbank's trustees to make an annual decision as to whether the supplemental\nbenefit should be paid for the year in question. The words \"each calendar year\"\nappearing in the first sentence of the subdivision are intended to describe the\nsupplement as an annual payment, the maximum amount of which is to be\ndetermined on the basis of the cost-of-living index figure for the year in\nquestion. The words do not qualify the manner in which the trustees must act in\norder to authorize the supplement. The grammatical sense of the language is\nthat (i) the trustees may, in their discretion, determine to supplement any\nretirement benefit payable by a savings bank and (ii) such supplement may be\nmade \"each calendar year\", measured on the basis of the cost-of-living index\nfor each year. This interpretation is confirmed by the parallel language\ncontained in subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of Section 250, where reference to \"each\nyear of service\" or similar language describes the benefits to be paid rather\nthan the manner in which the trustees must act. Any interpretation of the subdivision which conditioned the\nsupplemental benefits upon an annual decision would make it impossible to fund\nthe benefits. By its nature, a funded program requires a continuing plan whose\nfuture costs can be estimated and provided for on a current basis. Requiring a new decision to be made each year and thereby\nprecluding the use of a funded program would contravene the intent of\nsubdivision 5, which was to permit pension benefits to be supplemented through\nfunding. Subdivision 5 provides for a supplement to any retirement benefit\npayable \"in accordance with the preceding subdivisions of this section\". Subdivision 3 expressly authorizes funded benefits, consequently, the\nsupplements contemplated by subdivision 5 include those provided in connection\nwith funded plans. An interpretation which made it difficult either as a matter\nof law or as a practical matter, to fund these benefits would contravene the\nintent of the Legislature.
