Tit. 9 § 9.171 - Executive Order No. 47.3: Declaring a Disaster Emergency in the State of New York and Ordering into Active Service the New York National Guard to Assist Authorities in Guaranteeing Public Property at Various Correctional Facilities\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, on February 19, 2025, I issued Executive Order 47\ndeclaring a State Disaster Emergency in the State of New York arising from an\nillegal and unlawful strike by correction officers that began on February 17, 2025, and has continued thereafter; WHEREAS, New York State Civil Service Law Section 210, known as the Taylor Law, strictly prohibits strikes by public employees and\ndeems any such strike illegal. This prohibition safeguards the continuity of\nvital public services and upholds public trust in government operations. Those\ncorrection officers participating in this strike are willfully violating New\n\nYork State law as well as a temporary restraining order of the Supreme Court of\nthe State of New York, issued on February 19, 2025; WHEREAS, Subdivision 4 of Section 50 of New York State\n\nCivil Service Law authorizes the disqualification of applicants for civil\nservice employment who have previously been dismissed from public service for\nmisconduct, or otherwise separated under circumstances demonstrating\nmisconduct; WHEREAS, New York State is committed to the fair and\nmeritbased hiring of public employees, and to ensuring that all individuals\nappointed to State Service uphold the law and their oath of public office. Individuals participating in illegal strikes have willfully violated the Taylor\n\nLaw and an order of the Supreme Court of the State of New York by engaging in\nmisconduct that undermines the public trust, demonstrates disregard for the\nlaw, disrupts public services, and is inconsistent with suitability for public\nservice roles; and\nWHEREAS, it is therefore necessary to establish a State\npolicy barring the hiring of individuals participating in this illegal and\nunlawful strike and recommending their separation from State service be\nreported as a removal for cause, consistent with State law and applicable\nregulations; NOW THEREFORE, I, Kathy Hochul, by virtue of the authority\nvested in me by the Constitution and laws of the State of New York, do here by\ndirect as follows: * The Department of Corrections and Community Supervision\nshall, upon the separation of any employee: (i) immediately investigate such employee's\ninvolvement in the illegal and unlawful strike; (ii)\npursuant to Executive Law 845(2)(b) and 9 NYCRR\n6056, promptly report to the New York State Central Registry of Police and\n\nPeace Officers maintained by the Division of Criminal Justice Services the\nseparation from service of any individual employed by the Department of\n\nCorrections and Community Supervision as a peace officer who is found to have\nparticipated in the illegal and unlawful strike as a removal for cause; and\n(iii)\nreport any employee who\nis found to have participated in the illegal and unlawful strike to the Office\nof Employee Relations; * All New York State agencies shall, as a part of their\nprocess to determine if an applicant is eligible to be hired, determine whether\nan applicant was previously employed by the Department of Corrections and\n\nCommunity Supervision and thereafter separated from such employment in\nconnection with such applicant's participation in the illegal and unlawful\nstrike; * All New York State agencies shall, as part of any\nbackground investigation, determine whether the individual being investigated\nwas previously employed by the Department of Corrections and Community\n\nSupervision and thereafter separated from such employment in connection with\nsuch individual's participation in the illegal and unlawful strike; * No New York State agency shall hire or appoint any\nindividual who was previously employed by the Department of Corrections and\n\nCommunity Supervision and thereafter separated from such employment in\nconnection with such individual's participation in the illegal and unlawful\nstrike. This prohibition applies to all appointments in the classified service\nof the State, as well as any hires in the unclassified service where Civil\n\nService Law provisions apply; and\n* Within three days of this directive, where applicable, the Office of Employee Relations, in consultation with the Department of Civil\n\nService, shall issue guidance to all New York State agencies on how to\nintegrate the above requirements into their hiring practices; and\nFURTHER, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section\n29-a\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, I hereby extend and continue the suspensions and modifications\ncontained in Executive Orders 47 through 47.2 and hereby temporarily suspend or\nmodify the following laws, for the period from the date of this Executive Order\nthrough April 9, 2025: * Subdivisions one and four of section\n70\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law are suspended and modified to the extent necessary to\nprohibit the transfer and change of title of any permanent employee who was\npreviously employed by the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision\nand thereafter separated from such employment in connection with such\nindividual's participation in the illegal and unlawful strike; * Articles 5, 17, and section\n450\nof the County\n\nLaw, and any ordinances, local laws, resolutions, rules and regulations adopted\nto implement such statutes are suspended and modified to the extent necessary\nto prohibit the appointment, transfer, and promotion of any individual who was\npreviously employed by the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision\nand thereafter separated from such employment in connection with such\nindividual's participation in the illegal and unlawful strike; * Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Municipal Home Rule Law, and\nany local laws, resolutions, rules and regulations adopted to implement such\nstatutes, are suspended and modified to the extent necessary to prohibit the\nappointment, transfer, and promotion of any individual who was previously\nemployed by the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision and\nthereafter separated from such employment in connection with such individual's\nparticipation in the illegal and unlawful strike; * Articles 6 and 20 of the Correction Law, and any\nordinances, local laws, resolutions, rules and regulations adopted to implement\nsuch statutes are suspended and modified to the extent necessary to prohibit\nthe appointment, transfer, and promotion of any individual who was previously\nemployed by the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision and\nthereafter separated from such employment in connection with such individual's\nparticipation in the illegal and unlawful strike; and\n* Section\n2.30(6)\nof the Criminal\n\nProcedure Law is suspended and modified to the extent necessary to prohibit a\ncertificate attesting to satisfactory completion of training requirements to\ncontinue to remain valid after the interruption of service of an individual who\nwas previously employed by the Department of Corrections and Community\n\nSupervision and thereafter separated from such employment in connection with\nsuch individual's participation in the illegal and unlawful strike.
