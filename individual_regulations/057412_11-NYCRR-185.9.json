Tit. 11 § 185.9 - Commissions and fees or other allowances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An insurer issuing group credit life and group credit accident and health insurance policies may pay commissions on said business only to the insurance agent or broker who solicits the master group policy and/or is designated the agent or broker of record. The general agent or agent or broker of record may not be: (1)\nthe policyholder or any of its employees, officers or directors; (2)\na trustee, trustees or agent or any of their employees, officers or directors, in the event that a group credit insurance policy is issued to a trustee, trustees or agent designated by two or more creditors or vendors; or\n(3)\nthe creditor or vendor member of a trust or agency or any of its employees, officers or directors. The aforesaid general agent or agent or broker of record may share commissions only with another agent or broker who aids in the solicitation of the master policy but in no event, either directly or indirectly, with any of the above enumerated parties. (b) The agent or broker of record and/or any agent or broker sharing commissions for solicitation of the master policy of credit insurance, as authorized by subdivision (a) of this section, shall be licensed in accordance with Insurance Law, section 2103 or section 2104. (c) Fees or other allowances shall include administration fees, service fees or any other payment of a similar nature payable by an insurer to an insurance agent or broker or to any other person, firm, association or corporation. Fees may be paid only for such services as are performed on behalf of the insurer and only in such amounts as would reflect the reasonable cost of performing such services. Fees may only be paid to such party or parties, including the policyholder or creditor, who perform the services. The amount of service fees must be justified by the insurer and, at least initially, stated as a dollar amount per transaction that may then be related as a percentage of premium to approximate the aggregate service fee. Other approximations may be used subject to the approval of the superintendent. Services for which fees may be payable include but are not limited to, the following: computation of premium, collection of premiums, issuance of certificates, making refunds and processing claims. (d) In no event shall the aggregate of commissions and all service fees be such as to render the policy not self-supporting based on the loss ratio requirements underlying the calculation of the rates, along with reasonable assumptions as to expenses. (e) Each insurer shall file with the superintendent its schedule of rates of commissions, and other fees or allowances to agents and brokers pertaining to the solicitation or sale of credit insurance and of fees or allowances, exclusive of amounts payable to persons who are in the regular employ of the insurer other than as agent or broker, to any individuals, firms or corporations pertaining to the service or administration of the credit insurance. Such schedules must separate compensation for solicitation or sale from compensation for services or administration of the credit insurance. An insurer may revise such schedules from time to time, and shall file such revised schedules with the superintendent. No insurer shall pay an amount of compensation other than as filed with the superintendent. (f) Fees for service or administration may be payable to a policyholder or creditor to the extent the policyholder or creditor performs such service on behalf of the insurer, and must be set forth in the group policy.
