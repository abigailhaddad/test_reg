  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-10.2 - General monitoring and inspection requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The following general requirements apply\nto all monitoring required by this Subpart or the permit: (1)\n\nSamples and measurements taken for the\npurpose of monitoring must be representative of the activity and medium being\nmonitored. (2)\n\nThe monitoring\nsystems and data evaluation process must have sufficient sensitivity to\ndemonstrate that the performance objectives and all applicable Federal and\n\nState environmental standards are met. (3)\n\nThe permittee must maintain monitoring\nsystems and equipment in good working order and protect them from tampering, vandalism, and inclement weather. (4)\n\nAll monitoring systems and equipment must\nbe periodically inspected, tested, and calibrated to ensure the proper and\ncontinuous functioning of the monitoring system and equipment. (5)\n\nAll monitoring programs must include\ncollection of data to be used as input to the models used in the technical\nanalysis required by sections\n383-3.4\n(h)(2)\nand\n383-13.4\n(b)(8)\nof\nthis Part. (6)\n\nIf a monitoring\nstation required by this Part fails to operate properly or is unexpectedly\nremoved from service, the permittee must immediately notify the department. Unless otherwise directed by the department, the permittee must replace or\nrepair the monitoring station, as necessary, to bring the station back into\noperation as soon as possible. (7)\nA systematic numbering system must be established for all samples collected, and a unique identification number must be assigned to each sample. (8)\n\nThe permittee must retain and maintain\nrecords of all monitoring information, including all calibration and\nmaintenance records and all original strip chart recordings for continuous\nmonitoring instrumentation in accordance with section\n383-13.2\nof this Part. Records of\nmonitoring information must include: (i) the\ndate, exact place, sample identification number, and time of sampling or\nmeasurements; (ii)\nthe name of the\nindividual who performed the sampling and measurements; (iii)\nthe date the analyses were\nperformed; (iv)\nthe name of the\nindividual who performed the analyses; (v) the analytical techniques or methods\nused; (vi)\nthe result of such\nanalyses with radiological results reported in both the International System of\n\nUnits (i.e., becquerels, grays, and sieverts) and customary units (i.e., curies, rads, and rems); (vii)\nrecords of internal laboratory quality assurance and control; and\n(viii)\nadditional information relating to the\nanalyses as requested by the department. (9)\n\nMonitoring data in the permittee's\ncomputer must at all reasonable times be available to the department through\nelectronic access to the permittee's computer. Where continuous monitoring data\nare transmitted by telephone from the monitoring device to the permittee's\ncomputer, the permittee must provide to the department telephone access to the\ndata at all times. (10)\n\nWhen\nfacility closure is commenced, a closure, post-closure and institutional\ncontrol period environmental monitoring program must be implemented. This\nmonitoring program must be based on the disposal method(s), the site design, the operating history and the closure and stabilization of the disposal site. It must be approved by the department in the modification of the permit for\nfacility closure. (11)\n\nMonitoring\nduring the closure, post-closure, and institutional control periods must, to\nthe maximum extent practicable, utilize the same monitoring points as those\nthat were utilized during the operation of the land disposal\nfacility. (12)\n\nMonitoring plans\nsubmitted by the applicant must include a description of the following: (i) the media to be monitored; (ii)\nthe equipment, instruments, and\nfacilities to be used; (iii)\nthe\ndata recording and statistical analysis procedures to be used; (iv)\nthe organization of the staff that will\nperform the monitoring; and\n(v) the\nquality assurance and quality control procedures to be followed. (b) General inspection\nrequirements. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator must\ninspect the land disposal facility for malfunctions and deterioration, operator\nerrors, and discharges that may be causing or may lead to: (i) release of radioactive material to the\nenvironment; and\n(ii)\na threat to\npublic health and safety. The owner or operator must conduct these inspections\noften enough to identify problems in time to correct them before they harm\npublic health and safety or the environment. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must develop and\nfollow a written schedule for inspecting monitoring equipment, safety and\nemergency equipment, security devices, and operating and structural equipment\nthat are important to preventing, detecting, or responding to environmental or\npublic health hazards. (i) The operator must\nkeep this schedule at the land disposal facility. (ii)\n\nThe schedule must identify the types of\nproblems (e.g.,malfunctions or deterioration) which are to be looked for during\nthe inspection. (iii)\n\nThe frequency\nof inspection may vary for the items on the schedule. However, it should be\nbased on the rate of possible deterioration of the equipment and the\nprobability of an environmental or public health and safety incident if the\ndeterioration or malfunction or any operator error goes undetected between\ninspections. (3)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must remedy any deterioration or malfunction of equipment or\nstructures found during the inspection on a schedule which ensures that the\nproblem does not lead to an environmental or public health and safety hazard. Where a hazard is imminent or has already occurred, action to remedy the\nproblem must be taken immediately. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator must record\ninspections in an inspection log or summary, and must retain those records as\nrequired by section\n383-13.2\nof this Part. At a minimum\nthese records must include the date and time of the inspection the name of the\ninspector, a notation of the observations made, and the date and nature of any\nrepairs or other actions taken to remedy problems found.
