  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.23 - Exhibit 23: water resources and aquatic ecology\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 23 shall contain the following with regard\nto: (a) Groundwater: (1)\n\nHydrologic information reporting depths\nto high groundwater and bedrock, including a site map showing depth to high\ngroundwater and bedrock in increments appropriate for the facility\nsite. (2)\nA map based on publicly\navailable information showing all areas within the study area delineating all\ngroundwater aquifers and groundwater recharge areas, and identifying\ngroundwater flow direction, groundwater quality, and the location, depth, yield\nand use of all public and private groundwater wells or other points of\nextraction of groundwater, and including delineation of well head and aquifer\nprotection zones. (3)\n\nAn analysis\nand evaluation of potential impacts (during normal and drought conditions) from\nthe construction and/or operation of the facility on drinking water supplies, groundwater quality and quantity in the facility area, including potential\nimpacts on public and private water supplies, including private wells within a\none mile radius of the facility site, and wellhead and aquifer protection\nzones. (b) Surface\nwater: (1)\nA map and identification of all\nsurface waters, including intermittent streams, within the study\narea. (2)\nA description of the New\n\nYork State listed water classification and standards physical water quality\nparameters, flow, biological aquatic resource characteristics (including\nspecies, habitat, and presence of aquatic invasive species) and other\ncharacteristics of such surface waters, including intermittent streams, within\nthe study area. (3)\n\nAn\nidentification of any downstream surface water drinking-water supply intakes\nwithin one mile, or if none within one mile, an identification of the nearest\none (giving location of the intakes by longitude and latitude) that could\npotentially be affected by the facility or interconnections, including\ncharacterization of the type, nature, and extent of service provided from the\nidentified source. (4)\n\nAn analysis\nof the impact of the construction and operation of the facility and\ninterconnections on such surface waters, including impacts to drinking water\nsupplies, and an identification and evaluation of reasonable avoidance measures\nand, where impacts are unavoidable, mitigation measures regarding impacts on\nsuch surface waters, including the precautions that will be taken to avoid or\nminimize dredging. (5)\n\nAn\nidentification and evaluation of reasonable avoidance measures, and where\nimpacts are unavoidable, mitigation measures, including the use of water\nstorage, stormwater reuse, and offsetting water conservation, regarding\ngroundwater impacts. (c) Stormwater: (1)\nA Stormwater Pollution\n\nPrevention Plan (SWPPP) for the collection and management of stormwater\ndischarges from the project prepared in accordance with the applicable SPDES\nGeneral Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Construction Activity (SPDES\nGeneral Permit) and the most current version of the New York State Standards\nand Specifications for Erosion and Sediment Control. If the project is not\neligible for coverage under the SPDES General Permit, a completed application\nfor a State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) Permit for the\ncollection and management of stormwater discharges from the project. (2)\n\nTo the extent not covered in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision, a preliminary plan, prepared in accordance with the\nmost current version of the New York State Standards and Specifications for\n\nErosion and Sediment Control, that identifies the post construction erosion and\nsediment practices that will be used to manage stormwater runoff from the\ndeveloped project site. This can include runoff reduction/green infrastructure\npractices, water quality treatment practices, and practices that control the\nvolume and rate of runoff. (d) Chemical and petroleum bulk storage: (1)\nA description of the spill prevention and\ncontrol measures to be in place for ammonia storage, fuel oil storage, wastewater storage, and other chemical, petroleum or hazardous substances\nstored on site, including an evaluation of alternatives and mitigation\nmeasures. (2)\n\nAn identification\nwhether the storage of ammonia, fuel oil, wastewater, other chemicals, petroleum or hazardous substances, or disposal of solid wastes on site is\nsubject to regulation under the State of New York's chemical and petroleum bulk\nstorage programs, and if so, a demonstration of compliance with such\nregulations. (3)\n\nAn identification\nwhether the storage of ammonia, fuel oil, wastewater, other chemicals, petroleum or hazardous substances on site is subject to regulation under local\nlaw (county, city, town or village), and if so, a demonstration of the degree\nof compliance with such local laws. (e) Aquatic species and invasive species: (1)\n\nAn analysis of the impact of the\nconstruction and operation of the facility on biological aquatic resources, including species listed as endangered, threatened, or species of special\nconcern in 6 NYCRR Part\n182, and including the potential for introducing and/or\nspreading invasive species. (2)\n\nAn\nidentification and evaluation of reasonable avoidance measures and, where\nimpacts are unavoidable, mitigation measures regarding impacts on such\nbiological aquatic resources, including species and invasive species impacts\n(if any) and assure compliance with applicable water quality standards (6 NYCRR\nPart\n703\n). (f) Cooling\nwater: (1)\na description of the proposed\ncooling water system, including the selected cooling technology, the source of\ncooling water, the cooling water intake structure location and design, the\ndaily maximum cooling water design flow and all the anticipated construction\nand operational costs of the cooling water system; (2)\na description of the volume and location\nof the cooling water discharge, the anticipated maximum discharge temperature\nand maximum delta T, and a description of the anticipated thermal\nplume; (3)\na description of the\npractices that will be employed to avoid pathogen growth (including\nlegionella), an assessment of whether such practices conform to recommendations\nof the Cooling Tower Institute, and the identification of any potential\nbiocides to be used in the cooling water system; (4)\na description of the taxonomic\nidentification and life history information of all species and life stages of\nfish and shellfish potentially susceptible to impingement and entrainment by\nthe proposed cooling water intake structure including the estimated number of\nall species and life stages to be impinged and entrained; and\n(5)\nan identification and evaluation of\nmitigation measures taken to minimize adverse environmental impacts to aquatic\nlife as a result of the location, design, construction, and capacity of the\ncooling water intake structure. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.23\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
