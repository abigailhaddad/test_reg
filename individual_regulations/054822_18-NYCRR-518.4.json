  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 518.4 - Interest\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Interest may be\ncollected upon any overpayments determined to have been made and will accrue at\nthe rate and in the manner set forth in this section. (b) Prior to the issuance of a notice of\ndetermination, interest will accrue at the current rate from the date of the\noverpayment. (c) After the issuance\nof a notice of determination, interest will accrue at the current rate, plus\ntwo percentage points, or the maximum legal rate, whichever is lower. (d) The current rate for purposes of this\nsection is the annual rate of interest as fixed by the department, in\nconsultation with the State Comptroller or superintendent of the Banking\n\nDepartment, after taking into consideration private consumer rates of interest\nprevailing on the date that the department became entitled to recovery of the\noverpayment. The rate may be revised quarterly by the department. (e) Interest may be waived in whole or in\npart when the department determines the imposition of interest would effect an\nunjust result, would unduly burden the provider or would substantially delay\nthe prompt and efficient resolution of an outstanding audit or investigation. No interest will be imposed upon any inpatient facility established under\narticle 28 of the Public Health Law as a result of an audit of its costs for\nany period prior to the issuance of a notice of determination, nor for a period\nof at least 90 days after issuance of such notice.
