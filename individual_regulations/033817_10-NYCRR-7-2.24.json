  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 7-2.24 - Variance; waiver\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Variance. In order to allow time to comply with certain provisions of this Subpart, an operator may submit a written request to the permit-issuing official for a variance from a specific provision(s) when the health and safety of the children attending the camp and the public will not be prejudiced by the variance, and where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in immediate compliance with the provision. An operator must meet all terms of an approved variance(s) including the effective date, the time period for which the variance is granted, the requirements being varied and any special conditions the permit-issuing official specifies. For any variance request relating to the requirements of section\n7-2.25\n(b) of this Subpart, the permit-issuing official shall consult with and obtain approval from the State Department of Health, prior to granting or denying the variance. (b) Waiver. In order to accept alternative arrangements that do not meet certain provisions of this Subpart but do protect the safety and health of the campers and the public, an operator may submit a written request to the permit-issuing official for a waiver from a specific provision of this Subpart. Such request shall indicate justification that circumstances exist that are beyond the control of the operator, compliance with the provision would present unnecessary hardship and that the public and camper health and safety will not be endangered by granting such a waiver. The permit-issuing official shall consult with a representative of the State Department of Health prior to granting or denying a waiver request. An operator must meet all terms of an approved waiver(s), including the condition that it will remain in effect indefinitely unless revoked by the permit-issuing official or the facility changes operators. For any waiver request relating to the requirements of section\n7-2.25\n(b) of this Subpart, the permit-issuing official shall consult with and obtain approval from the State Department of Health, prior to granting or denying the waiver.
