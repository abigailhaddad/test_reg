  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1806.31 - Term of approvals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Approvals issued under this Part shall have a term equal to the term of any\naccompanying member jurisdiction approval regulating the same subject matter, but not longer than 15 years, unless an alternate period is provided for in the\ncommission approval. If there is no such accompanying member jurisdiction\napproval, or if no term is specified in such accompanying member jurisdiction\napproval, the term of a commission approval issued under this Part shall be no\nlonger than 15 years or the anticipated life of the project, whichever is less, unless an alternate period is provided for in the commission\napproval. (b) Commission approval of\na project shall expire three years from the date of such approval if the\nwithdrawal, diversion or consumptive use has not been commenced, unless an\nalternate period is provided for in the docket approval or such three-year\nperiod is extended in writing by the commission upon written request from the\nproject sponsor submitted no later than 120 days prior to such expiration. The\ncommission may grant an extension, for a period not to exceed two years, only\nupon a determination that the delay is due to circumstances beyond the project\nsponsor's control and that there is a likelihood of project implementation\nwithin a reasonable period of time. The commission may also attach conditions\nto the granting of such extensions, including modification of any terms of\napproval that the commission may deem appropriate. (c) If a withdrawal, diversion or consumptive\nuse approved by the commission for a project is discontinued for a period of\nfive consecutive years, the approval shall be null and void, unless a waiver is\ngranted in writing by the commission, upon written request by the project\nsponsor demonstrating due cause and with notification thereof to the member\njurisdiction in which the project is located, prior to the expiration of such\nperiod. (d) If the commission\ndetermines that a project has been abandoned, by evidence of nonuse for a\nperiod of time and under such circumstances that an abandonment may be\ninferred, the commission may rescind the approval for such withdrawal, diversion or consumptive use. (e) If\na project sponsor submits an application to the commission no later than six\nmonths prior to the expiration of its existing commission approval, the\nexisting approval will be deemed extended until such time as the commission\nrenders a decision on the application, unless the existing approval or a\nnotification in writing from the commission provide\notherwise.
