This section establishes procedures for the determination of\nconfidential status of information submitted to the board, and for the\nretention by the board of confidential records. (b) Definition of confidential information. Confidential information may consist of, but shall not be limited to: proprietary data concerning past, present or planned future energy\ndistribution, sales volumes, or prices; customer lists; individual customer\nusage and billing data; proprietary energy conservation or renewable energy\nresource devices, processes or plans; critical infrastructure information; other trade secrets; and other information which is not published or divulged, disclosure of which would cause substantial injury to the competitive position\nof the submitter; or information required to be maintained as confidential\npursuant to any law, regulation, order, tariff, or licensing\ncondition. (c) Records containing\nconfidential information. (1)\n\nAny person\nsubmitting information to the board pursuant to law, regulation or directive\nand requesting confidential status for such information shall clearly identify\nthe information considered to be confidential and state the reasons why the\ninformation should be excepted or exempted from disclosure. A record containing\nconfidential information shall be labeled, on each page as appropriate, using\nsuch words as \"confidential,\" \"trade secret,\" \"proprietary information,\"\n\"critical infrastructure information,\" or words of similar import. The request\nshall be in writing and indicate: (i) the\nspecific information requested to be considered confidential, including, where\napplicable, page or form and line, chart or table designation; (ii)\nthe confidential nature of the\ninformation, including a description of the nature and extent of the injury to\nthe competitive position of the submitter (or to the person who supplied such\ninformation to the submitter) which would be incurred were the information to\nbe disclosed; (iii)\nwhether the\ninformation is treated as confidential by the submitter, including whether it\nhas been made available to others and, if so, under what conditions; (iv)\nthe worth or value of the information to\nthe submitter (or to the person who supplied such information to the submitter)\nand to either such person's competitors if applicable or known; (v) the amount of effort or money expended by\nthe submitter (or to the person who supplied such information to the submitter)\nin developing the record; (vi)\nwhether any patent, copyright or similar legal protection exists for the\ninformation; (vii)\nwhether the\npublic disclosure of such information is otherwise restricted by law, and the\nspecific source and contents of such restrictions; (viii)\nthe date upon which such information\nwill no longer need to be kept confidential, if known; (ix)\nwhether the request itself contains\ninformation which, if disclosed, would defeat the purpose for which\nconfidential status is sought; (x) whether persons other than the submitter have any interest in maintaining the\nconfidentiality of the information; and\n(xi)\nother factors considered relevant to the\nsubmitter. (2)\n\nSubject\nto the provisions of paragraph (6) of this subdivision, information submitted\nin accordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be submitted to the\nboard's records access officer. Such information shall be maintained apart by\nthe board from all other records until 15 days after the entitlement to\nconfidential status has been finally determined, or such further time as\nordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section, however, shall bar the chair from disclosing the information in the form of a summary\nwhich aggregates information provided by at least three similarly situated\nsubmitters and which summary is adequate to protect the interests of the\nsubmitters in the information. (3)\n\nOn the initiative of the board at any time, or upon the written request of any\nperson for access to information to which confidential status has been\nrequested, the records access officer shall: (i) inform the person who requested\nconfidential status of the record access officer's intention to determine\nwhether such status should be granted; (ii)\npermit the submitter who requested such\nstatus, within 10 business days of receipt of notification from the records\naccess officer, to submit a written statement of the necessity for the granting\nof such confidential status; and\n(iii)\nwithin 10 business days of receipt of\nsuch written statement, or within 10 business days of the expiration of the\nperiod prescribed for submission of such statement, issue a written\ndetermination, including the records access officer's rationale for granting or\ndenying such status. Copies of such determination shall be served upon the\nperson requesting the record, if any, the major energy supplier or other person\nwho requested or received confidential status, and the Committee on Open\n\nGovernment. (4)\nA\nrefusal to grant confidential status under paragraph (3) of this subdivision\nmay be appealed by the person submitting the information, and a refusal to\ndisclose the record may be appealed by the person requesting disclosure of the\nrecord in accordance with this subdivision. (i) Within seven business days of receipt of\nwritten notice of such refusal, the person aggrieved may file a written appeal\nfrom the record access officer's determination with the chair. (ii)\n\nThe appeal shall be determined by the\nchair within 10 business days of the receipt of the appeal. Written notice of\nthe determination shall be served upon the person requesting the record, if\nany, the person who requested or received confidential status, and the\n\nCommittee on Open Government. The notice shall contain a statement of the\nreasons for the determination. (5)\nA proceeding to review an adverse\ndetermination pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision may be commenced\npursuant to article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules by the person\nseeking an exception or exemption from disclosure. Such proceeding must be\ncommenced within 15 days of the service of the written notice containing the\nadverse determination provided for in subparagraph (4)(ii) of this subdivision. Neither the board nor the chair shall disclose such information prior to the\ntime a claim of confidentiality is finally resolved by a court of competent\njurisdiction, and thereafter any disclosure shall be consistent with the order\nof such court. (6)\n\nNothing in this\nsection shall require any person to disclose any information that would violate\nany law, regulation, order, or licensing condition. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
