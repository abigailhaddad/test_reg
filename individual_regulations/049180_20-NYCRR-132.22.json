  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 132.22 - Compensation received by nonresident professional athletes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nGeneral. The New York source income of a nonresident individual (see section\n631[a] of the Tax Law) who\nis a member of a professional athletic team includes that portion of such\nindividual's total compensation for services rendered as a member of a\nprofessional athletic team during the taxable year which the number of duty\ndays spent within New York State rendering services for the team in any manner\nduring the taxable year bears to the total number of duty days spent both\nwithin and without New York State during the taxable year. (2)\n\nSpecial rule. Travel days that do not\ninvolve either a game, practice, team meeting, promotional caravan or other\nsimilar team event are not considered duty days spent in New York State. However, such travel days shall be considered in the total duty days spent both\nwithin and without New York State. (b) Definitions. For purposes of this\nsection: (1)\n\nThe term professional athletic\nteam includes, but is not limited to, any professional baseball, basketball, football, soccer or hockey team. (2)\n\nThe term member of a professional\nathletic team shall include those employees who are active players, players on\nthe disabled list and any other persons required to travel and who travel with\nand perform services on behalf of a professional athletic team on a regular\nbasis. This includes, but is not limited to coaches, managers, and\ntrainers. (3)\n(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (iv)\nand (v) of this paragraph, the term duty days shall mean all days during the\ntaxable year from the beginning of the professional athletic team's official\npre-season training period through the last game in which the team competes or\nis scheduled to compete. Duty days shall be included in the allocation\ndescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the tax year in which they\noccur, including where a team's official pre-season training period through the\nlast game in which the team competes, or is scheduled to compete, occurs during\nmore than one tax year. (ii)\n\nDuty\ndays shall also include days on which a member of a professional athletic team\nrenders a service for a team on a date which does not fall within the\naforementioned period (e.g., participation in instructional leagues, the \"Pro\n\nBowl\" or promotional \"caravans\"). Rendering a service includes conducting\ntraining and rehabilitation activities, but only if conducted at the facilities\nof the team. (iii)\n\nIncluded within\nduty days shall be game days, practice days, days spent at team meetings, promotional caravans and preseason training camps, and days served with the\nteam through all post-season games in which the team competes or is scheduled\nto compete. (iv)\n\nDuty days for any\nperson who joins a team during the period from the beginning of the\nprofessional athletic team's official pre-season training period through the\nlast game in which the team competes, or is scheduled to compete, shall begin\non the day such person joins the team. Conversely, duty days for any person who\nleaves a team during such period shall end on the day such person leaves the\nteam. Where a person switches teams during a taxable year, a separate duty day\ncalculation shall be made for the period such person was with each\nteam. (v) Days for which a member\nof a professional athletic team is not compensated and is not rendering\nservices for the team in any manner, including days when such member of a\nprofessional athletic team has been suspended without pay and prohibited from\nperforming any services for the team, shall not be treated as duty\ndays. (vi)\n\nDays for which a member\nof a professional athletic team is on the disabled list and does not conduct\nrehabilitation activities at facilities of the team and is not otherwise\nrendering services for the team in New York State, shall not be considered duty\ndays spent in New York State. However, all days on the disability list are\nconsidered to be included in total duty days spent both within and without New\n\nYork State. (vii)\n\nThe provisions of\nthis paragraph can be illustrated by the following examples: Example 1:Player A, a member of a professional athletic\nteam, is a nonresident of New York State. Player A's contract for such team\nrequires A to report to such team's training camp and to participate in all\nexhibition, regular season, and playoff games. Player A has a contract which\ncovers seasons that occur during yr.1/yr.2 and yr.2/yr.3. Player A's contract\nprovides that A receive $500,000 for the yr.1/yr.2 season and $600,000 for the\nyr.2/yr.3 season. Assuming player A receives $550,000 from such contract during\ntaxable year 2 ($250,000 for one-half the yr.1/yr.2 season and $300,000 for\none-half the yr.2/yr.3 season), the portion of such compensation received by\nplayer A for taxable year 2, attributable to New York State, is determined by\nmultiplying the compensation player A receives during the taxable year\n($550,000) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of duty\ndays player A spends rendering services for the team in New York State during\ntaxable year 2 (attributable to both the yr.1/yr.2 season and the yr.2/yr.3\nseason) and the denominator of which is the total number of player A's duty\ndays spent both within and without New York State for the entire taxable\nyear. Example 2:Player B, a member of a professional athletic\nteam, is a nonresident of New York State. During the season, B is injured and\nis unable to render services for B's team. While B is undergoing medical\ntreatment at a clinic, which is not a facility of the team, but is located in\n\nNew York State, B's team travels to New York State for a game. The number of\ndays B's team spends in New York State for practice, games, meetings, etc., while B is present at such clinic, shall not be considered duty days spent in\n\nNew York State for player B for that taxable year for purposes of this section, but such days are considered to be included within total duty days spent both\nwithin and without New York State. Example 3:Player C, a member of a professional athletic\nteam, is a nonresident of New York State. During the season, C is injured and\nis unable to render services for C's team. C performs rehabilitation exercises\nat the facilities of C's team in New York State as well as at personal\nfacilities in New York State. The days C performs rehabilitation exercises in\nthe facilities of C's team are considered duty days spent in New York State for\nplayer C for that taxable year for purposes of this section. However, days\nplayer C spends at personal facilities in New York State shall not be\nconsidered duty days spent in New York State for player C for that taxable year\nfor purposes of this section, but such days are considered to be included\nwithin total duty days spent both within and without New York State. Example 4:Player D, a member of a professional athletic\nteam, is a nonresident of New York State. During the season, D travels to New\n\nYork State to participate in the annual all-star game as a representative of\nD's team. The number of days D spends in New York State for practice, the game, meetings, etc., shall be considered to be duty days spent in New York State for\nplayer D for that taxable year for purposes of this section, as well as\nincluded within total duty days spent both within and without New York\n\nState. Example 5:Assume the same facts as given in example 4, except that player D is not participating in the all-star game and is not\nrendering services for D's team in any manner. Player D is instead travelling\nto and attending such game solely as a spectator. The number of days player D\nspends in New York State for such game shall not be considered to be duty days\nspent in New York State for purposes of this section. However, such days are\nconsidered to be included within total duty days spent both within and without\n\nNew York State. (4)\n(i) The\nterm total compensation for services rendered as a member of a professional\nathletic team means the total compensation received during the taxable year for\nservices rendered: (a) from the beginning of\nthe official pre-season training period through the last game in which the team\ncompetes or is scheduled to compete during that taxable year; and\n(b) during the taxable year on a date which\ndoes not fall within the aforementioned period (e.g., participation in\ninstructional leagues, the \"Pro Bowl\" or promotional \"caravans\"). Such compensation shall include, but is not limited to, salaries, wages, bonuses as described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, and any other type of compensation paid during the taxable year to a member of\na professional athletic team for services performed in that year. Such\ncompensation shall not include strike benefits, severance pay, termination pay, contract or option year buy-out payments, expansion or relocation payments, or\nany other payments not related to services rendered for the team. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of\nthis paragraph, \"bonuses\" included in \"total compensation for services rendered\nas a member of a professional athletic team\" subject to the allocation\ndescribed in subdivision (a) of this section are: (a) bonuses earned as a result of play (i.e., performance bonuses) during the season, including bonuses paid for\nchampionship, playoff or \"bowl\" games played by a team, or for selection to\nall-star league or other honorary positions; and\n(b) bonuses paid for signing a contract, unless all of the following conditions are met: (1)\nthe payment of the signing bonus is not\nconditional upon the signee playing any games for the team, or performing any\nsubsequent services for the team, or even making the team; (2)\nthe signing bonus is payable separately\nfrom the salary and any other compensation; and\n(3)\nthe signing bonus is\nnonrefundable. (c) This\nsection is designed to apportion and allocate to New York State, in a fair and\nequitable manner, a nonresident's total compensation for services rendered as a\nmember of a professional athletic team. It is presumed that application of the\nforegoing provisions of this section will result in a fair and equitable\napportionment of such compensation. Where it is demonstrated that the method\nprovided under this section does not fairly and equitably apportion such\ncompensation, the department may require such member of a professional athletic\nteam to apportion and allocate such compensation under such method as the\ndepartment prescribes as long as the prescribed method results in a fair and\nequitable apportionment. A nonresident member of a professional athletic team\nmay submit a proposal for an alternative method to apportion such compensation\nwhere such nonresident member demonstrates that the method provided under this\nsection does not fairly and equitably apportion such compensation. The proposed\nmethod must be fully explained in such nonresident member's New York State\nnonresident personal income tax return. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
