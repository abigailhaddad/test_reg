  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-6.1 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following are examples intended to address only the\ndetermination of whether the capital is business capital or investment capital. The examples do not address the corporation's entire tax computation, such as\nthe apportionment of amounts deemed business income. Example 1: Fossil Fuel Corporation (\"Fossil\") is a\nvertically integrated oil business. Fossil recently sold off 60% of its 100%\nownership interest in Northwest Exploration, Inc. (\"NWE\"), a subsidiary engaged\nin oil exploration in far northern latitudes. While Fossil no longer owns a\nmajority of NWE's stock, it remains the largest shareholder. In addition, NWE\ncontinues to operate as part of Fossil's vertically integrated oil business, benefiting from functional integration, centralized management and economies of\nscale. NWE and Fossil are engaged in a unitary business but\ncannot be included in a combined report because they do not meet the capital\nstock requirement. Because Fossil and NWE are unitary, Fossil's NWE stock is\nother unitary corporation stock. Fossil's NWE stock is business capital because\nother unitary corporation stock is always business capital. In addition, the\ndividend income Fossil receives from NWE would constitute other unitary\ncorporation dividends and, as such, other exempt income. Any gain on the sale\nof additional NWE stock by Fossil would be business income. Example 2: NewsCo is a newspaper publisher incorporated\nin Delaware and commercially domiciled in Illinois that publishes local\nnewspapers in New York and 10 other states. In 2020, anticipating a serious\nshortage of newspaper print, NewsCo acquires 30% of the stock of PaperCo, a\npaper mill company with facilities in North Carolina, Georgia and Oregon. This\naction is taken in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a shortage of newsprint. Based on its significant ownership share, NewsCo is given two seats on\n\nPaperCo's 15-member board of directors. No changes are made in PaperCo's senior\nmanagement, and the relationship of the two businesses largely remains that of\npurchaser and supplier. In 2022, when it appears the newsprint shortage is\nover, NewsCo sells its stock in PaperCo for a gain of $80 million. NewsCo and PaperCo are not engaged in a unitary\nbusiness. They are in related but distinct lines of business, and while NewsCo\nowns 30% of PaperCo's stock and has two seats on the board of directors, no\nsteps were taken toward functional integration or centralized management. However, while the two corporations are not engaged in a unitary business, NewsCo's investment in PaperCo, Inc. serves an operational function for\n\nNewsCo's that is, to facilitate NewsCo's access to newsprint during the\nshortage. Consequently, the PaperCo stock owned by NewsCo is not\nconstitutionally protected investment capital. If the stock meets all of the criteria in section\n3-4.1\n(a)(1) or\n(a)(2)\nof this Part, the stock would be\nconsidered either actual or presumed investment capital, respectively. Dividend\nincome received from PaperCo and the $80 million gain from the sale of\n\nPaperCo's stock would be income from investment capital. If the stock did not meet the criteria in section\n3-4.1\n(a)(1) or\n(a)(2)\nof this Part, then the stock would be\nbusiness capital. As a result, any dividend income received from PaperCo would\nbe business income and the $80 million gain from the sale of PaperCo's stock\nwould be business income. Example 3: Ore Corporation, a mining company\nincorporated and commercially domiciled in Utah, routinely invests its cash on\nhand in short-term debt instruments that yield interest income. These\ninvestments serve an operational function in Ore corporation's business and\ntherefore are not constitutionally protected investment capital. Consequently, these debt instruments are business capital, and the income they generate is\nbusiness income. Example 4: EquipmentCo, a manufacturer of farm equipment\nincorporated in Delaware and commercially domiciled in Iowa, operates sales and\ndistribution facilities in New York State. EquipmentCo maintains a portfolio of\nstocks and bonds in the telecommunications sector managed to generate long-term\ngains. As such, its investments in telecommunications stocks and bonds are not\npart of EquipmentCo's unitary farm equipment business in New York State and do\nnot serve an operational function in EquipmentCo's business. The dividend and\ninterest income generated by the telecommunication stocks and bonds do not have\nthe constitutionally required connection to EquipmentCo's business in New York\n\nState. The stocks and bonds qualify as constitutionally protected investment\ncapital and the income from the stocks and bonds is income from investment\ncapital. Example 5: MMW, Inc. is engaged in a multistate\nmanufacturing and wholesaling business incorporated and commercially domiciled\nin New Jersey. In connection with that business, it maintains a special reserve\nfund available for use in the case of a natural disaster or other extraordinary\nevent. The securities in the reserve fund include both \"blue chip\" stocks and\nAAA bonds. The fund serves an operational function for MMW, Inc. \" ensuring the\nunitary business can remain operational in the event of a natural disaster or\nother extraordinary event. Since the securities in the fund serve an\noperational function, the securities are not constitutionally protected\ninvestment capital. Because actual and presumed investment capital is limited\nby law to stocks, the bonds are prohibited from being investment capital and\nany interest income or net gains generated by those bonds is business income. In order for the stocks in the special reserve fund to be considered investment\ncapital, the stocks must satisfy the criteria in section\n3-4.1\n(a)(1) or\n(a)(2)\nof this Part. If the stocks are\ninvestment capital, the dividends from the stock and the net gains from the\nsale of the stock would be income from investment capital. If the stocks do not\nsatisfy these criteria, the stocks would be business capital and the dividends\nand net gains from those stocks would be business income. Example 6: MNO is incorporated and commercially\ndomiciled in California. It develops software. In 2022, MNO issued a stock\noffering, netting $300 million. The explicitly stated purpose of the offering\nwas to provide additional capital for the acquisition of companies and products\nin the same line of business as, or complementary to, MNO's line of business. Consistent with that purpose, MNO kept the funds acquired in segregated\naccounts. Within those accounts, MNO invested in a broad array of securities, including both stocks and bonds. Because the explicit stated purpose of the funds and\nassets in the segregated accounts is clearly tied to the unitary software\ndevelopment business of MNO, the funds and securities serve an operational\nfunction for all years the funds and securities are at MNO's disposal. As such, the securities are not constitutionally protected investment capital. Because\nactual and presumed investment capital is limited by law to stocks, the bonds\nare prohibited from being investment capital and any income earned from those\nbonds is business income. If the stocks in the segregated accounts meet all the\ncriteria in section\n3-4.1\n(a)(1) or\n(a)(2)\nof this Part, the stocks would be\nconsidered actual or presumed investment capital, respectively, and the\ndividends and net gains from the stocks would be income from investment\ncapital. If the stocks do not satisfy all of those criteria, the stocks would\nbe business capital and the dividends and net gains from those stocks would be\nbusiness income. Example 7: Retail Corp, incorporated and commercially\ndomiciled in North Carolina, earns substantial revenue from its retail\noperations located solely within New York. It invests a large portion of the\nrevenue in fixed income securities that are divided into three\ncategories: (a) short-term securities\nheld pending use of the funds in the taxpayer's retail business; (b) short-term securities held pending\nacquisition of other companies or favorable developments in the long-term money\nmarket; and\n(c) long-term\nsecurities held as an investment. The income generated by both types of\nshort-term securities serves an operational function for Retail Corp. As a\nresult, the short-term securities are not constitutionally protected investment\ncapital. If the securities in category (a) or (b) include stocks and the stocks\nmeet all the criteria in section\n3-4.1\n(a)(1) or\n(a)(2)\nof this Part, the stocks would be\nconsidered actual or presumed investment capital, respectively, and the\ndividends and net gains from the stocks would be income from investment\ncapital. The stocks in categories (a) and (b) above that do not meet all the\ncriteria to be considered actual or presumed investment capital and any other\nsecurities in categories (a) and (b) above are business capital and any\ninterest income, dividends or net gains from those securities are business\nincome. The interest income, dividends or net gains from the long-term\nsecurities in category (c) held as an investment do not have the\nconstitutionally required connection to the retail operations in New York\n\nState. These long-term securities qualify as constitutionally protected\ninvestment capital and any interest income, dividends or net gains from the\nsecurities are income from investment capital. Example 8: Manu Corp. is a manufacturer incorporated and\ncommercially domiciled in California with facilities in New York and other\nstates. In 2018, Manu Corp. purchases, at a deep discount, corporate bonds\nissued by Grocery, Inc., a large supermarket chain in default on its interest\npayments and on the verge of bankruptcy. Manu Corp. believes that Grocery, Inc. will be able to emerge from its difficulties as a viable business and that the\n\nGrocery, Inc. bonds it holds will sell at a considerably higher price at some\nfuture date. Manu Corp. sells the bonds in 2022 for a significant gain. Even\nthough Manu Corp's investment is in corporate bonds, the nature of the\ninvestment is more akin to an investment in stock held for long-term\nappreciation. Manu Corp. will not be receiving interest income from the bonds\nor using the bonds as collateral. The bonds, therefore, are not serving an\noperational function. The investment in the bonds is an investment separate and\napart from the unitary business of Manu Corp. The net gain on the sale of the\nbonds does not have the constitutionally required connection to Manu Corp's\noperations in New York. The bonds are constitutionally protected investment\ncapital and the net gain is income from investment capital. Example 9: Same facts as example 9, except that the\npurchaser of the Grocery, Inc. corporate bonds is FISCO, which is incorporated\nand commercially domiciled in Connecticut and operates a diversified financial\nservices business. In addition to being a dealer in securities, it buys and\nsells securities for its own account. The purchase of the Grocery, Inc. bonds\nis within the scope of FISCO's unitary financial services business of buying\nand selling securities. Therefore, the bonds are not constitutionally protected\ninvestment capital. In the hands of FISCO, the Grocery Inc. corporate bonds are\nbusiness capital and the net gain on the sale of the bonds is business\nincome. Example 10: VinylCo is incorporated and commercially\ndomiciled in Delaware and is a manufacturer of rubber and vinyl products. In\n2022, it purchased a 15% interest in SupplierCo, which supplies VinylCo with\nsynthetic rubber, to obtain status as a preferred customer. In all other\nrespects, VinylCo and SupplierCo operate independently. VinylCo and SupplierCo\nare not engaged in a unitary business. However, VinylCo's investment in\n\nSupplierCo serves an operational function for VinylCo by helping VinylCo to\nmaintain an ongoing supply of synthetic rubber. As such, the stock VinylCo owns\nin SupplierCo is not constitutionally protected investment capital. If the\nstock meets all the criteria in section\n3-4.1\n(a)(1) or\n(a)(2)\nof this Part, the stock would be\nconsidered actual or presumed investment capital, respectively, and the\ndividends and net gains from the stock would be income from investment capital. If the stock does not satisfy all of these criteria, the stock would be\nbusiness capital and the dividends and net gains from the stock would be\nbusiness income. Example 11: RDS is incorporated and commercially\ndomiciled in Connecticut, and is principally engaged in the operation of a\nchain of retail department stores within and without New York State. RDS also\nholds stock in several corporations, including QRS Inc., which designs, develops and markets \"off-the-shelf\" computer programs. In 2022, RDS sells its\nstock in QRS Inc. which it purchased in 2014, at a $100 million net gain. Because RDS's investment in the stock of QRS Inc. was not part of RDS's unitary\nretail business and did not serve an operational function, the stock is\nconstitutionally protected investment capital and the net gain is income from\ninvestment capital. Example 12: Corporation A has entire net income (ENI) of\n$15,000. Included in that amount is $0 of gross other exempt income and $2,000\nof gross investment income before the gross investment income limitation\nprovided for in section\n3-4.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart, broken down as follows: * $1,700 from constitutionally protected investment\ncapital; and\n* $300 from actual investment capital. The gross investment income limitation in section\n3-4.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart provides that gross investment income is limited to greater of the income\nfrom constitutionally protected investment capital of $1,700 or 8% of ENI of\n$15,000, or $1,200. As a result, Corporation A has $1,700 of gross investment\nincome in the tax year. Corporation A elects to use the safe harbor reduction\nmethod of this Part when computing investment income and therefore reduces the\n$1,700 of gross investment income by 40%. The result is $1,020 of investment\nincome claimed in the tax year. Example 13: Same facts as example 12, except that\n\nCorporation A did not elect to use the safe harbor method election and\ndetermines it has $400 of interest deductions directly or indirectly\nattributable to gross investment income and investment capital. Corporation A must reduce its gross investment income of\n$1,700 by $400, the total interest deductions directly or indirectly\nattributable to gross investment income and investment capital. The result is\n$1,300 of investment income claimed in the tax year. Example 14: Corporation A has ENI of $100,000 in the 2021\ntax year. Included in that amount is $0 of gross other exempt income and\n$20,000 of gross investment income before the gross investment income\nlimitation in section\n3-4.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart, broken down as follows: * $2,000 from constitutionally protected investment\ncapital; * $7,000 from actual investment capital; and\n* $11,000 from presumed investment capital. The gross investment income limitation in section\n3-4.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart provides that gross investment income is limited to the greater of the\n$2,000 of the income from constitutionally protected investment capital or 8%\nof ENI, which is $8,000. As a result, Corporation A has gross investment income\nof $8,000 in the 2021 tax year. Corporation A does not elect to use the safe harbor\nreduction method and determines it has $1,750 of interest deductions directly\nor indirectly attributable to gross investment income and investment\ncapital. Corporation A must reduce the $8,000 of gross investment\nincome by $1,750, the total amount of interest deductions directly or\nindirectly attributable to gross investment income and investment capital. The\nresult is $6,250 of investment income claimed in the 2021 tax year. After filing the report for the 2021 tax year, Corporation A disposes of its 2021 presumed investment capital before it is\nheld for more than one year. Based on the ordering rules in section\n3-4.5\n(b) of this\n\nPart, the $8,000 of gross investment income claimed in the 2021 tax year was\ncomprised of $2,000 from constitutionally protected investment capital and\n$6,000 from actual investment capital. Corporation A is not subject to the\nrequirements in section\n3-4.4\nof this Part because the\namount of investment income claimed in the 2021 tax year, after applying the\ngross investment income limitation in section\n3-4.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart, did not include income from presumed investment capital that failed to\nmeet the holding period requirement. Example 15: Corporation D has $50,000 in ENI in the 2021\ntax year. Included in that amount is $0 of gross other exempt income and\n$20,000 of gross investment income before the gross investment income\nlimitation in section\n3-4.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart, broken down as follows: * $3,000 from stock A that is actual investment\ncapital; * $2,000 from stock B that is presumed investment\ncapital; and\n* $15,000 from stock C that is presumed investment\ncapital. The gross investment limitation in section\n3-4.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart provides that gross investment income is limited to the greater of income\nfrom constitutionally protected investment capital, which is $0, or 8% of ENI, which is $4,000. As a result, Corporation D has gross investment income of\n$4,000 in the 2021 tax year. Corporation D does not elect to use the safe harbor\nreduction method and determines it has $1,170 of interest deductions directly\nor indirectly attributable to gross investment income and investment capital. Corporation D must reduce its gross investment income of $4,000 by $1,170, the\ntotal amount of interest deductions directly or indirectly attributable to\ngross investment income and investment capital. The result is $2,830 in\ninvestment income claimed in the 2021 tax year. After filing the report for the 2021 tax year, Corporation D disposes of Stock B after it is held for more than one year and\n\nStock C before it is held for more than one year. Based on the ordering rules\nin section\n3-4.5\n(b) of this\n\nPart, the $4,000 of gross investment income claimed in the 2021 tax year was\ncomprised of $3,000 from Stock A (the actual investment capital) and $1,000\nfrom Stock B (the presumed investment capital held for more than one year). Corporation D is not subject to the requirements in section\n3-4.4\nof this Part because the\namount of investment income claimed in the 2021 tax year, after applying the\ngross investment income limitation in section\n3-4.6\n(c) of this\n\nPart, did not include income from presumed investment capital that failed to\nmeet the holding period requirement. Example 16: InvestCo is a foreign corporation that owns\na minority interest in Asset Manager, a partnership operating solely in New\n\nYork State that performs a variety of investment activities. InvestCo and Asset\n\nManager are not engaged in a unitary business. Aside from its investment in\n\nAsset Manager, InvestCo has no physical presence or activities in New York\n\nState. In 2022, InvestCo sells its interest in Asset Manager\nfor a gain. Because the increase in Asset Manager's value was a result of its\nactivities within New York State and the benefits provided by New York State, InvestCo's interest in Asset Manager is not constitutionally protected\ninvestment capital. As such, the interest in Asset Manager is business capital\nand the gain from disposition of such interest is business income. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
