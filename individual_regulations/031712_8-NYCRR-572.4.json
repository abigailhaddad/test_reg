All parking citations are\nreturnable as described pursuant to the State University Trustees umbrella\nregulations (section\n560.3\n[d]\nof this\n\nTitle). (e) Enforcement activities. (1)\n\nTicketing. Parking enforcement officers and university police officers are\nempowered to issue summonses (tickets) to vehicles found in violation of any\nparking regulations. Summonses are issued in accordance with subdivision (a)\nand (b) of this section. Officers are empowered to issue adjudication summonses\nwhen appropriate due to the seriousness of the situation.

(2)\n\nCited violators. (i) Each issued summons must be answered by\npaying the fine or by filing an appropriate appeal online or in-person at\nparking and transportation services.

(ii)\n\nFailure to pay a summons when due will result in the imposition of a late\npayment fee, in accordance with subdivision (d) of this section. (3)\n\nAppeals. (i) A plea of innocent to a summons, a claim\nof extenuating circumstances, or a request for personal hearing, shall be made\nin accordance with printed instructions on the summons. Appeals may be\nsubmitted in-person at parking and transportation services or online via the\nparking website. (ii)\n\nAppeals must\nbe submitted in writing within 15 calendar days following the date of issuance. This constitutes the first step of the appeal process. (iii)\n\nUnfavorable appeal decisions at the\nfirst step described above may be taken to the second step of the appeal\nprocess, by requesting an in-person hearing. Request for hearing must be\nsubmitted to parking and transportation services within 10 days of the date of\nthe first step decision. (iv)\n\nHearings are scheduled before an appeals officer and are heard under oath. Appellants are allowed to make sworn statements and provide further evidence in\nsupport of the appeal. Hearings are tape recorded and scheduled for\napproximately 15 minutes in duration. (v) Whenever an appeal is denied by the\nhearing officer, the appellant must pay the fine. Failure of a student to pay a\nfine may result in the withholding of transcripts and imposition of other\nuniversity sanctions until the fine is paid. Failure of a university employee\nto pay a fine may result in appropriate deduction from salary or wages due\nuntil the fine is paid. Failure of visitors to pay fines may result in legal\nproceedings. (vi)\n\nSubsequent to\npaying the fine, the appellant may access a third and final step of the appeal\nprocess, which entails the coordination of a three member panel of university\nfaculty, staff, and student members. The panel's responsibility is to review\nthe decision(s) made at prior appeal steps in effort to determine whether there\nwas an error in fact or law, or that the appellant was not afforded due\nprocess.

(6)\n\nAdditional sanctions -\nstudents. Any student who has unpaid parking tickets will have a registration\nhold placed on his/her student record, preventing him/her from registering for\ncourses. This hold may only be removed upon presentation of a receipt from the\nparking office showing that all tickets have been paid in full or that a pay\nagreement has been made. This registration hold also prevents students from\nreceiving grades, transcripts and diplomas. (7)\n\nAdditional sanctions - employees. Deduction from wages for faculty and staff.
