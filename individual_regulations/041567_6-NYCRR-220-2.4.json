  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 220-2.4 - Source monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner or operator of a glass melting\nfurnace located at a glass plant that meets the applicability requirements of\nsection\n220-2.1\nof this Subpart must\nmaintain a file of daily glass production rates. The production rates must be\nsummarized monthly. Glass production records must be retained for at least five\nyears following the date of such records and must be made available for\ninspection by the department during normal business hours. (b) The owner or operator of glass melting\nfurnace shall demonstrate compliance with the NO\nx\nRACT\nemission limit(s) established in section\n220-2.3\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart by measuring NO\nx\nemissions with a CEMS. The\nCEMS shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (c) of this section or\nwith equivalent requirements approved by the department. Any approved\nequivalent CEMS requirements will be submitted by the department to the United\n\nStates Environmental Protection Agency for approval as separate State\n\nImplementation Plan revisions. (c) CEMS requirements. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator\nof a glass melting furnace shall install, calibrate, evaluate, operate, and\nmaintain a CEMS, in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR part\n60, appendices A, B and F, for measuring NO\nx\nat locations\napproved in the CEMS certification protocol under paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision, and shall record the output of the system. (2)\n\nAs part of its application for a permit\nor permit modification, the owner or operator of a glass melting furnace shall\nsubmit for department approval a CEMS plan. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator of a glass melting\nfurnace shall submit for department approval a CEMS certification protocol at\nleast 60 days prior to CEMS certification testing. The certification protocol\nshall include the location of and specifications for each instrument or device, as well as procedures for calibration, operation, data evaluation, and data\nreporting. (4)\n\nThe procedures in\nsubparagraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph shall be used for determining\ncompliance with the NO\nx\nRACT emission limit established\nunder section\n220-2.3\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart. (i) The owner or operator of a glass\nmelting furnace shall determine compliance daily on a 30 day rolling average\nbasis. The 30 day rolling averages shall be calculated by dividing 30 day total\nNO\nx\nemissions by 30 day total glass production. Only\ndays when the furnace operates shall be included in the 30 day rolling\naverages. (ii)\n\nAt a minimum, valid\nCEMS data shall be obtained for 90 percent of the operating hours in each\ncalendar quarter that the subject facility is operating. (iii)\n\nAll valid CEMS data shall be used in\ncalculating emission rates even if the minimum data requirements of\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph are not met. (iv)\n\nAlong with any specific additional data\nrequirements mandated by the department for a particular glass melting furnace, annual recertifications, quarterly accuracy, and daily calibration drift tests\nshall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR part\n60, appendix F. (v) When NO\nx\nemissions data are not obtained because of CEMS downtime, or for periods when\nno valid CEMS data is available, emission data shall be obtained by using the\n90th percentile value of all CEMS NO\nx\nemission data\ncollected over the last 180 days. (5)\n\nIn addition to the requirements of\nsubparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this paragraph, the owner or operator of a\nglass melting furnace shall comply with the CEMS recordkeeping and reporting\nrequirements of 40 CFR part\n60, subpart A and appendix F. (i) The owner or operator of a glass melting\nfurnace shall notify the department of the planned initial start-up date of any\nnew CEMS. (ii)\n\nEmissions, monitoring, and operating parameter records or measurements required by this\n\nSubpart and any additional parameters required by the department shall be\nmaintained for at least five years and made available to the department upon\nrequest. (iii)\n\nOn a semi-annual\nbasis, the owner or operator of a glass melting furnace shall tabulate and\nsummarize applicable emissions, monitoring, and operating parameter\nmeasurements recorded during the preceding six months, and submit these records\nto the department. These records shall be submitted in a format acceptable to\nthe department and shall include: (a) the 30\nday rolling average NO\nx\nemissions as specified under\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision; (b) identification of the operating hours\nwhen NO\nx\nemissions data are not included in a\ncalculation of the 30 day rolling average emissions and the reasons for not\nincluding that data; (c) a\ncomparison of the NO\nx\nemissions to the NO\nx\nRACT emissions limit(s); (d) type and amount of fuel burned on a daily\nbasis and the as burned heat content of the fuel; (e) the total daily NO\nx\nemissions and total daily glass production; and\n(f) the results of CEMS\naccuracy assessments as required by 40 CFR part\n60, appendix F and any\nadditional data quality information required by the department. (d) Protocols, reports, summaries, schedules, and any other information required to\nbe submitted to the department under provisions of this Subpart must be sent\n(in either hardcopy or electronically) as follows: (1)\none copy to the Division of Air\n\nResources, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 625\n\nBroadway, Albany, New York 12233; and\n(2)\none copy to the regional air pollution\ncontrol engineer at the appropriate regional office of the\ndepartment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n220-2.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
