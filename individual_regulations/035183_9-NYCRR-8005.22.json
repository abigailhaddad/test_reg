  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8005.22 - Delinquent Time Case Review\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It is the\npolicy of the Board of Parole to review, sua sponte, any revocation\ndetermination wherein a time assessment imposed is in excess of 24 months. The\npurpose of said review is to provide the members of the board, acting in\nexecutive session, an opportunity to freely discuss such determinations, to\ndecide, in view of the totality of the case record, whether such determination\nis considered to be appropriate by the majority of the members of the board, given the fact that the underlying revocation decision is rendered by a single\nboard member. The delinquent time case review is not a substitute for an\nadministrative appeal taken and decided pursuant to Part 8006 of this Title or\nany appeal pursuant to subdivision 4-a of section\n259-i\nof the\n\nExecutive Law. Rather, given that such an appeal of a revocation determination\nis limited to a review of the revocation record, the delinquent time case\nreview is intended to permit the board to consider any information in its\nrecords that it considers to be pertinent to the case, so as to facilitate\nequitable and consistent decision making. Insofar as the delinquent time case\nreview represents an internal opportunity for the members of the board to\ndiscuss cases that are within the aforementioned category, the time for the\nconduct of said review may vary in the sole discretion of the board and, in\nkeeping with the purpose of the case review, the board will not solicit or\naccept input from outside of the board, or advise the subject of the case\nreview that the matter is under consideration. (b) Review under this section shall not occur\nuntil the administrative appeal permitted pursuant to Part 8006 of this Title\nhas been decided, or the time to take such an appeal has expired, and, as the\ndelinquent time case review is not an administrative remedy, its pendency or\nconduct shall not preclude a violator from seeking judicial review of an\nunderlying revocation determination once the administrative appeal permitted\npursuant to part 8006 of this Title is concluded. Furthermore, review under\nthis section shall not occur until an appeal pursuant to subdivision 4-a of\nsection\n259-i\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, if any, has been decided and all further appeal or litigation\ntherefrom has concluded, and either administrative appeal permitted pursuant to\n\nPart 8006 of this Title has been decided thereafter, or the time to take an\nadministrative appeal in such circumstance has expired. (c) A time assessment in the underlying\nrevocation determination may not be increased by a review conducted pursuant to\nthis section. In a case where a time assessment is reduced, the violator will\nbe provided with written notice of the amended time assessment. A written\nstatement of reasons will not be issued for any case reviewed pursuant to this\nsection, nor will notice be provided to a violator that such person's case has\nbeen reviewed, except to the extent that such review results in a reduction of\na time assessment imposed. (d) A\ndelinquent time case review shall be conducted by a quorum of the members of\nthe board, and decided by a majority vote of the members present. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
