  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 138.3 - Eligibility for reimbursement upon promotion\n\nState Regulations\n\nEmployees permanently promoted to full-time administrative, educational, professional, scientific or technical positions shall be eligible\nfor reimbursement for approved moving and travel expenditures in accordance\nwith the provisions of these regulations. Division of the Budget Interpretation\n\nThe following is our interpretation of the rules governing\nreimbursement of moving and travel expenses insofar as they apply to\nprovisional appointees. This interpretation is based on the premise that the\nbasic reason for relocation is the achievement of permanent status\nnotwithstanding that the actual physical move of household effects may pre-date\nthat of permanent appointment. Therefore, it is our opinion that an employee provisionally\npromoted to a position in another location which would otherwise qualify him\nfor reimbursement for moving expenses should be reimbursed for such expenses, subject to the following conditions: No reimbursement should be made until the provisional\nappointment becomes permanent. On achieving permanent status, the employee could file a\nclaim for reimbursement within one year of the date of permanent\nappointment. If the employee elects to move at the time of provisional\nappointment, he should conform to the requirements of the rules with respect to\nobtaining competitive bids and receipted copies of bills of lading or freight\nbills and retain such material until he submits a claim for reimbursement after\nachieving permanent status. If the employee elects to move his household effects only\nafter achieving permanent status, he should be reimbursed for moving expenses\nat that time. We believe this is a reasonable interpretation and is within\nthe intent of the rules. [July 18, 1962]\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
