Tit. 10 §§ 70-3.1 - Validation testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior to using an autoclave to treat regulated medical waste, a facility shall conduct validation testing under conditions, including, but not limited to load configuration, composition and volume, that simulate conditions anticipated during actual waste treatment. Validation testing protocols shall be included in the facility's autoclave operation plan submitted to the department pursuant to section\n70-3.2\nof this Subpart. (b) (1)\n\nValidation testing shall employ spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus at a minimum concentration of 6 log\n10\nspores per indicator unit placed in the center of the load or otherwise coldest point in the autoclave chamber as identified by the manufacturer; provided, however, the department may require alternative and/or supplemental indicators as necessary to demonstrate effectiveness of treatment. (2)\n\nEffective treatment of regulated medical waste shall be demonstrated by a 4 log\n10\nreduction in viable Geobacillus stearothermophilus spore concentration, or other measure of effectiveness for alternative and/or supplemental indicators as specified by the department.
