  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 105.3 - Short periods resulting from a change in accounting period\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 605(a)(2)\n(a) Where a short period results from a\nchange in the taxpayer's accounting period, the taxpayer must, where such\ntaxpayer meets any of the conditions provided for in section\n151.9\nof this Title (relating to New York State personal income tax returns for short\ntaxable periods), also file a New York State personal income tax return for\nsuch short period. Such taxpayer's New York taxable income must be computed on\nthe basis of the period for which the New York State personal income tax return\nis made and in accordance with the rules applicable to the determination of New\n\nYork taxable income generally (see sections\n611\nand\n618\nof the Tax Law), except\nthat the standard deduction (see section\n614\nof the Tax Law) and exemptions (see\nsection\n616\nof the Tax Law) will be allowed only to\nthe following extent: (1)\n\nStandard deduction. The amount allowed as a New York standard deduction is that amount which bears\nthe same ratio to the New York standard deduction allowed (see section\n614\nof the Tax Law), as the number of months\nin the short period bears to 12 months. (2)\n\nExemptions. The amount of allowable\nexemptions is that amount which bears the same ratio to the full amount for\nsuch exemptions (see section\n616\nof the Tax Law), as the number of months\nin such short period bears to 12 months. (b) The provisions of subdivision (a) of this\nsection are illustrated by the following example: Example: A resident individual had been filing Federal and New\n\nYork State personal income tax returns on the basis of a fiscal year ending\n\nMarch 31st. Such individual changes to a calendar year in 1991 and files a\n\nFederal and New York State personal income tax return for the short period\n\nApril 1, 1991 to December 31, 1991. Such individual's New York adjusted gross\nincome for this short period was $12,000. Assume that such individual is a head\nof household, claiming the standard deduction and entitled to claim two\ndependent exemptions. The amount such individual is entitled to claim as a\nstandard deduction and the amount such individual is entitled to claim for\nexemptions on the New York State personal income tax return for the short\nperiod (April 1, 991 to December 31, 1991) is determined as follows: Standard\ndeduction $7,000 x 9/12 = $5,250 Two dependent exemptions of $1,000 each =\n$2,000 x 9/12 = $1,500 New York taxable income for the short period is\ndetermined as follows: New York adjusted gross income\n$12,000\n\nLess: Standard deduction\n5,250\n\nBalance\n$ 6,750\n\nLess: Exemptions\n1,500\n\nNew York taxable income\n$ 5,250\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n105.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
