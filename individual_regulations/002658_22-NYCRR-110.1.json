  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 110.1 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section 12 of chapter 548 of the Laws of 1980 requires the State Commissioner\nof Mental Health and the Chief Administrator of the Courts to implement section\n11 of that chapter (which added a new section 330.20 to the Criminal Procedure\n\nLaw, hereinafter cited as C PL 330.20) by jointly adopting rules respecting the\nfollowing matters: (1)\nthe\nscope of the psychiatric examinations prescribed by C PL 330.20; (2)\nthe data to be furnished\nthe psychiatric examiners conducting the examinations prescribed in C PL\n330.20; (3)\nthe form\nand content of the examination reports required to be filed under C PL\n330.20; (4)\nthe form\nand content of the applications authorized to be filed under C PL 330.20; and\n(5)\nthe form and\ncontent of the court orders issuable under C PL 330.20. (b) (1)\n\nThe rules prescribed in this Part, including the forms appended hereto (see Chapter II of Subtitle D of this\n\nTitle), have been jointly adopted by the State Commissioner of Mental Health\nand the Chief Administrator of the Courts. The appended forms shall be the\nofficial forms for use in implementing C PL 330.20. Variations in these forms\nwill be permitted if jointly approved by the said commissioner and chief\nadministrator, or if, in the context of a particular case, a variation in a\nform is required in order to comply with an applicable provision of\nlaw. (2)\n\nSince the\nappended forms do not expressly provide for a defendant who is mentally\nretarded, the appropriate forms must be modified by the court to conform with\nthe provisions of C PL 330.20 when a defendant, found not responsible by reason\nof mental disease or defect, is determined by the court to be mentally retarded\nand not suffering from a dangerous mental disorder. In such case, if the\ndefendant is in need of care and treatment as a resident in the inpatient\nservices of a developmental center or other residential facility for the\nmentally retarded and developmentally disabled, jurisdiction is vested by law\nin the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, and\nnot in the State Office of Mental Health [C PL 330.20(1)(d)]. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n110.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
