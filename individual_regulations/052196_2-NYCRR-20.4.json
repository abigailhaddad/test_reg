  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 20.4 - Authorization of higher counsel fees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon written request by private counsel, the State Comptroller, in his\ndiscretion, may authorize the payment, in appropriate circumstances, of fees\nfor services in a particular case in amounts higher than those set forth in the\nfee schedule. A request for higher fees must set forth the circumstances\njustifying the request and shall include a list of the partners, associates and\nparalegals assigned to provide the services, together with their normal rates. In determining the appropriateness of authorizing higher fees, the State\n\nComptroller shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors: (1)\nthe prevailing fees for similar services\nin the area in which the case is to be heard; (2)\nthe experience of private counsel, both\ngenerally and in cases of the type under consideration; (3)\nthe difficulty of the case under\nconsideration (e.g.,scientific or technical evidence, availability of\nwitnesses). (b) The\n\nState Comptroller shall approve or disapprove the request for higher fees and\nadvise private counsel of his decision in writing. A copy of the decision shall\nbe transmitted by the State Comptroller to the Attorney General. (c) Except as provided in subdivision (d) of\nthis section, any fees over and above those set forth in the fee schedule which\nhave been approved by the State Comptroller shall apply only to services\nrendered subsequent to such approval. (d) The State Comptroller may approve fees\nover and above those set forth in the fee schedule for services rendered prior\nto such approval when exigencies of time and scheduling in connection with the\ncase under consideration effectively preclude a timely request for higher\nfees. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n20.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
