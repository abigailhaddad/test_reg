  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 720-6.4 - Correctness and reasonableness of fuel adjustment charges\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe commission may hold hearings upon its own motion, or\nupon the motion of any interested party upon good cause shown, as to the\ncorrectness and reasonableness of any increased rate or charge for fuel costs\nsubject to a fuel adjustment clause. At any hearing so commenced, the burden of\nproof as to the propriety of any such rate or charge shall be with the utility. In any case in which it is determined that fuel adjustment charges were\nexcessive because of lack of reasonable care or are otherwise unreasonable or\nincorrect, the commission may order remedial action, including an adjustment of\nany previous collection under the fuel adjustment clause. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§§\n720-6.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
