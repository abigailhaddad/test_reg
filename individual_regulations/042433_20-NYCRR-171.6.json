Tit. 20 § 171.6 - Determining New York State personal income tax to be withheld on wages paid to nonresident of New York State\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. An employer must deduct and withhold New York State personal income\ntax on all wages paid to an employee who is a nonresident of New York State for\nservices performed in New York State. The New York State personal income tax to\nbe deducted and withheld is to be determined in accordance with section\n171.4\nof this Part, Appendix 10 of this Title, and this section. If the services of a\nnonresident employee are performed entirely in New York State, the employer\nmust deduct and withhold New York State personal income tax from all wages paid\nto such employee. Wages paid to a nonresident employee for personal services\nrendered entirely without New York State are not subject to withholding of New\n\nYork State personal income tax. (b) Income of a nonresident for services performed partly within and partly without\n\nNew York State. (1)\n\nIf a nonresident employee\nperforms services partly within and partly without New York State, such\nnonresident employee should file a Certificate of Nonresidence and Allocation\nof Withholding Tax (form IT-2104.1) for the purposes indicated in paragraphs\n(2) and (3) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe employer should withhold New York\n\nState personal income tax on the basis of the apportionment shown by the\nnonresident employee on form IT-2104.1, but must nevertheless make necessary\nadjustments during the year so that the proper amount of New York State\npersonal income tax is withheld from the employee's wages. For the purpose of\nmaking these adjustments, the proportion of remuneration which is paid for\nservices rendered within New York State is to be determined as follows: (i) If the services are rendered by a\ntraveling salesman, agent or other employee whose compensation on the basis of\ncommissions depends directly on the volume of business transacted by such\nemployee, the amount attributable to services within New York State is that\nproportion of the compensation received which the volume of business transacted\nby the employee within New York State bears to the volume of business\ntransacted by the employee within and without New York State. (ii)\n\nWith respect to all other employees, the\namount of wages attributable to services within New York State is that\nproportion of the total compensation which the total number of working days\nemployed within New York State bears to the total number of working days\nemployed both within and without New York State, exclusive of nonworking days. Nonworking days usually include Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, and days of\nabsence because of illness, personal injury, vacation or leave with or without\npay. (3)\n\nThe portion of\nwages allocable to New York State may be determined by the employer on the\nbasis of the preceding year's experience, except that the employer must make\nany necessary adjustments during the year to insure that the required New York\n\nState personal income tax is withheld for the current year. If the employee\nreasonably expects that the preceding year's experience will not be applicable\nto the current year, he may furnish to his employer a certificate on form\nIT-2104.1, estimating the proportion of his wages allocable to New York State, or the employer himself may make such estimate and may then withhold New York\n\nState personal income tax on the basis thereof; in either case, however, the\nemployer is required to make the necessary adjustments during the year so that\nthe proper amount of New York State personal income tax is withheld from the\nemployee's salary for the current year. (4)\n\nWhere a nonresident employee will work\nonly a short period of time within New York State and it is reasonably expected\nthat the total wages of such nonresident employee for services rendered within\n\nNew York State will not exceed the amount of such employee's personal\nexemptions, the employer need not withhold or deduct any amount of New York\n\nState personal income tax from such employee's wages until the aggregate amount\npaid to such employee exceeds the amount of such employee's personal\nexemptions. (5)\n\nAn employer is\nrequired to withhold New York State personal income tax on all wages paid to a\nnonresident employee who works partly within and partly without New York State, unless there is filed with such employer a Certificate of Nonresidence and\n\nAllocation of Withholding Tax on form IT-2104.1, or unless the employer\nmaintains adequate current records to determine accurately the amount of wages\nfrom New York State sources. The mere filing of the certificate on form\nIT-2104.1 does not, however, relieve the employer from the duty of withholding\nthe proper amount of New York State personal income tax from wages paid to an\nemployee. Form IT-2104.1 must be retained by the employer and must be available\nfor inspection by representatives of the Tax Commission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
