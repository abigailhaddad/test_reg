The applicant or recipient must\ninclude his or her minor dependent children in the application. When a minor\ndependent child is named as an applicant for public assistance, his or her\nnatural or adoptive parents and blood-related or adoptive brothers and sisters\n(who are also minor dependent children) must also apply for public assistance\nand have their income and resources applied toward the public assistance\nhousehold if they reside in the same dwelling unit as the applying minor\ndependent child. A person required to be added to the public assistance\nhousehold is deemed to be included in the application already on file as of the\ndate the person joins the household, either by birth, adoption, or by moving\ninto the dwelling unit of the existing public assistance household. For the\npurposes of this subdivision, a minor dependent child is a child who is under\n18 years of age. Parents and siblings who are SSI recipients, stepbrothers and\nstepsisters, ineligible sponsored aliens, aliens who fail to meet the\ncitizenship and alienage requirements in section\n349.3\n(a) of this\n\nTitle, individuals ineligible due to the lump sum provision of section\n352.29\n(h) of this\n\nPart, or children who are receiving adoption subsidies which are exempt under\nsection\n352.22\n(p) of this\n\nPart are not required to apply in accordance with this subdivision.

The local district must deem any income of the\nnonapplying parents of the 18-to 21- year-old parent to be available to such\nparent if they reside together in the same dwelling unit. Such income must be\ndeemed available to the minor parent to the same extent as income of a\nstepparent under section\n352.14\nof this Part. However, such\nincome must not be deemed available to the applying dependent\nchild. (d) Treatment of\nsanctioned persons. (1)\n\nThe needs of an\nindividual required to be in the public assistance household pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) of this section must not be considered and the needs of the\nfamily must be determined based on the remaining persons in the public\nassistance household when: (i) the individual\nwillfully fails or refuses to furnish or apply for a social security number for\neach member of the household pursuant to section\n369.2\n(b)(1)\nor\nsection\n370.2\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Title; (ii)\n\nRepealed and\n\nReserved\n(iii)\nthe individual fails\nor refuses to apply for or use employee group health insurance benefits\npursuant to section\n349.6\nof this\n\nTitle.

Unless required to be in the public\nassistance household pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, legally\nresponsible relatives of a dependent child or spouse may choose whether or not\nto apply for assistance. The income and presence in the home of a legally\nresponsible relative who chooses not to apply for or who is ineligible for\nassistance for a reason other than a sanction subject to subdivision (d) of\nthis section must be considered. Such persons include, but are not limited to, persons who are ineligible by reason of their immigration status or their\nreceipt of nonrecurring lump sum income. The public assistance budget for a\nhousehold residing with such a legally responsible relative is calculated as\nfollows: (i) The needs of the public\nassistance household are calculated as if the nonapplying or ineligible person\nwere applying for assistance as a member of the public assistance\nhousehold. (ii)\n\nThe pro rata share\nof the amount calculated in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph which is\nattributable to the nonapplying or ineligible person is determined. (iii)\n\nIf the nonapplying or ineligible\nperson's income is less than his or her pro rata share of the amount in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, such person' s needs and income are not\ncounted when calculating the budget deficit or surplus of the public assistance\nhousehold, and only the needs and income of the persons actually applying are\nconsidered. (iv)\n\nIf the nonapplying\nor ineligible person's income is equal to or greater than his or her pro rata\nshare of the amount in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, such person's needs\nand income are counted when calculating the budget deficit or surplus of the\npublic assistance household, as if the person were applying for\nassistance. (v) For purposes of the\npreceding subparagraph, the income of a recipient of SSI who is not applying\nfor public assistance and who is the parent of a home relief applicant or\nrecipient who is under the age of 21 or who is the spouse of a home relief\napplicant or recipient is considered to be equal to his or her pro rata share\nof the amount in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, and any amounts of his or\nher income which would otherwise exceed such pro rata share are\ndisregarded. (vi)\n\nThe resources of\nthe public assistance household include the nonapplying person's resources\nregardless of the amount of such person's income. With respect to a nonapplying\nperson who is in receipt of SSI, resources which are exempt for purposes of SSI\nare not taken into consideration. (f) When an applicant for or recipient of\npublic assistance refuses to cooperate in applying for or accepting SSI\nbenefits for himself or herself or for a member of the public assistance\nhousehold, the needs of such individual shall be eliminated from the grant, and\nthe needs of the family shall be determined based on the remaining persons in\nthe grant. If, however, such individual is physically or emotionally unable to\ncomplete the SSI application process, the local department of social services\nshall provide any services which are necessary to insure that the individual is\nassisted in making the SSI application. In such instance, that individual shall\nnot be denied public assistance and care. (g) Intentional program violation penalties. When an applicant for or a recipient of public assistance is found to have\ncommitted an intentional program violation (public assistance-IPV) either\nthrough an administrative disqualification hearing or by a court of appropriate\njurisdiction, or has signed either a waiver of right to an administrative\ndisqualification hearing or a disqualification consent agreement, his or her\nneeds cannot be considered for the following periods when determining the\namount of assistance: (1)\nfor six months for\nthe commission of a first public assistance-IPV; (2)\nfor 12 months for the commission of a\nsecond public assistance-IPV, or when the offense results in the wrongful\nreceipt of benefit is in an amount between $1,000 and $3,900; (3)\nfor 18 months for the commission of a\nthird public assistance-IPV or when the offense results in the wrongful receipt\nof benefits in an amount in excess of $3,900; (4)\nfor five years for the commission of a\nfourth or subsequent public assistance-IPV; findings of the commission of intentional program\nviolations in the ADC and HR programs prior to August 20, 1997 must be\nconsidered in determining the sanction to be imposed for a public\nassistance-IPV; (5)\nany\nsanction imposed by this subdivision will remain in effect unless and until the\nfinding upon which the sanction was imposed is reversed by a court of\nappropriate jurisdiction; or\n(6)\nthe income and resources of an individual disqualified from receiving\nassistance under this subdivision, but not his or her needs, must be budgeted\nagainst the needs of anyone who is in the sanctioned person's filing unit or\nanyone applying for or in receipt of assistance for whom the sanctioned person\nis legally responsible.
