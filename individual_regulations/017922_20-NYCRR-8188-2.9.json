(2)\n\nReimbursement for successful completion\nof one or more components of the basic course of training shall be made in the\nfull amount due under this Part as vouchers are received. (3)\n\nReimbursement for training completed\nbetween April 1st and July 31st of each fiscal year in compliance with the\ncontinuing education requirements of this Part shall be made in accordance with\nthis paragraph. All such amounts due shall be totaled and compared to the first\nallotment minus all payments of reimbursement for basic training; this\nconstitutes the net first allotment. If the total of possible reimbursement is\nequal to the net first allotment, the full amount due shall be paid for each\nvoucher. If the total of possible reimbursement is less than the net first\nallotment, the full amount due shall be paid for each voucher and the remainder\nshall be added to the second allotment. If the total of possible reimbursement\nis more than the net first allotment, the total of possible reimbursement shall\nbe divided into the net first allotment. The resulting fraction is the first\nproration factor. The first proration factor shall be applied to each\ncontinuing education voucher to determine the reimbursement payment to be made\nfor each of these vouchers. (4)\n\nReimbursement for training completed between August 1st and November 30th of\neach fiscal year in compliance with the continuing education requirements of\nthis Part shall be made in accordance with this paragraph. All such amounts\nshall be totaled and compared to the second allotment, minus all payments of\nreimbursement for basic training plus any addition resulting from paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision; this constitutes the net second allotment. If the total of\npossible reimbursement is equal to or less than the net second allotment, the\nfull amount shall be paid for each voucher and any remainder shall be added to\nthe third allotment. If the total of possible reimbursement is more than the\nnet second allotment, the total of possible reimbursement shall be divided into\nthe net second allotment. The resulting fraction is the second proration\nfactor. The second proration factor shall be applied to each continuing\neducation voucher amount to determine the reimbursement payment to be made for\neach of these vouchers. (5)\n\nReimbursement for training completed between December 1st and March 31st of\neach fiscal year in compliance with the continuing education requirements of\nthis Part shall be made in accordance with this paragraph.

If the total of\npossible reimbursement is equal to or less than the net third allotment, the\nfull amount shall be paid for each voucher. If the total of possible\nreimbursement is more than the net third allotment, the total of possible\nreimbursement shall be divided into the net third allotment. The resulting\nfraction is the third proration factor. The third proration factor shall be\napplied to each continuing education voucher amount to determine the\nreimbursement payment to be made for each of these vouchers. (f) Whenever any training is\ndeemed to satisfy the requirements of this Part pursuant to the provisions of\nsubdivision (c) of this section, section 8188- 2.8(a)(4) and (h) of this\n\nSubpart and section\n8188-4.8\n(c) and\n(f) of this Part for purposes of\nreimbursement pursuant to this section, that training shall be deemed to have\nbeen completed on the date upon which it is deemed to satisfy the appropriate\ntraining requirement.
