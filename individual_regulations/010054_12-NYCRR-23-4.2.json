  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-4.2 - Trench and area type excavations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever any person is required to work in or is lawfully frequenting any\ntrench or excavation five feet or more in depth which has sides or banks with\nslopes steeper than those permitted in Table I of this Subpart, such sides or\nbanks shall be provided with sheeting and shoring in compliance with this Part\n(rule). Such sheeting and shoring system shall be in contact with the sides or\nbanks of such trench or excavation. A designated person shall carefully inspect\nsuch sheeting and shoring at least once each day and more frequently in the\nevent of rain, the presence of additional surface or ground water from any\nsource, excessive ground vibrations or whenever additional loads of any kind\nhave been imposed near or adjacent to such excavation. Additional protection\nagainst slides and cave-ins shall be provided whenever necessary. Any trench or\nexcavation in clay, sand, silt, loam or nonhomogenous soil which has sides or\nbanks more than three feet but less than five feet in depth shall be provided\nwith side or bank protection in compliance with this Part (rule). Such side or\nbank protection shall not be required where an employer maintains on file at\nthe excavation site a dated certification in writing by a designated person who\nis qualified by training and experience indicating that such person has\nexamined the sides and banks and has found them to be stable and not subject to\nfailure or cave-in. Such certification shall be available for examination by\nthe commissioner. (b) Where the\nsides or banks of a trench or area type excavation may be sloped back without\ncausing subsidence or damage to buildings, structures, utilities, roads, streets, highways or similar facilities, sloping of the excavation sides or\nbanks may be used as protection in lieu of the sheeting and shoring required by\nthis Part (rule), provided such sloping conforms to the values set forth in\n\nTable I of this Subpart. Such sloping of the excavation sides or banks may be\nused in combination with sheeting and shoring. When such a combination is used, a level bench at least 24 inches in width shall be left between the toe of the\nsloped section and the braced section. The sheeting of the braced section shall\nextend at least 12 inches above the elevation of such level bench. (c) Any unbraced sloped excavation which\nextends below the ground water table, especially adjacent to rivers, reservoirs\nor other bodies or sources of free water, shall be under the direct supervision\nof an experienced person designated by the employer. (d) In any excavation with a combination of\nsloped unbraced sides or banks near the surface and vertical sheeted and shored\nsides or banks near the bottom, the steepest allowable slope of such unbraced\nportion of the sides or banks shall be based on the total excavation depth. (See Table I of this Subpart.)\n(e) Where any side or bank of an excavation is undercut and has a reverse slope\ntoward the trench centerline creating a vertical load on the sheeting and\nshoring, such sheeting and shoring shall be designed by, and installed in\naccordance with the specifications determined by, a professional engineer\nlicensed to practice in the State of New York. Such sheeting and shoring shall\nbe designed to support the vertical load imposed by the overhanging material as\nwell as the load imposed by the adjacent ground. (f) Excavated material and other superimposed\nloads shall be placed at least 24 inches back from the edges of any open\nexcavation and shall be so placed or piled that no part thereof can slide, fall\nor roll into the excavation. Such 24-inch required clearance may be reduced if\nthe employer installs a barrier or similar retaining device which is designed\nand constructed to prevent excavated material from falling into the excavation. TABLE I\nSTEEPEST ALLOWABLE UNBRACED SLOPES\nDepth of\n\nExcavation\n\nType of Soil or\n\nRock\n5 to 10 ft. Over 10 ft. Stiff cohesive soil\n11/2 vertical on 1 horizontal\n1 vertical on 1 horizontal (trench) 1 1/2 vertical\non 1 horizontal (area)\n\nNoncohesive soil\n1 vertical on 1 horizontal 1 vertical on 1 1/2\nhorizontal (when subject to vibrations)\n1 vertical on 1 horizontal 1 vertical on 1 1/2\nhorizontal (when subject to vibrations)\n\nSoft cohesive or wet flowing soil\n1 vertical on 1 horizontal 1 vertical on 11/2\nhorizontal (when subject to vibrations)\n1 vertical on 11/2 horizontal (trench) 1 vertical\non 1 horizontal (area) 1 vertical on 1 1/2 horizontal (when subject to\nvibrations)\n\nStable rock\n\nVertical sides permitted\n\nVertical sides permitted\n\nUnstable rock\n11/2 vertical on 1 horizontal\n11/2 vertical on 1 horizontal\n\nNotes: The slopes given in Table I are\nthe steepest allowable. Conditions may occur requiring the use of flatter\nslopes to prevent slope failure and subsidence of adjacent areas. A slope shall\nstart from the bottom of each side of an excavation or where the lower portions\nof such sides consist of stable rock from the top of such rock. (g) All sides or banks, slopes and\nareas in and adjacent to any excavation shall be stripped and cleared of loose\nrock or any other material which may slide, fall, roll or be pushed upon any\nperson located in such excavation. (h) Any open excavation adjacent to a\nsidewalk, street, highway or other area lawfully frequented by any person shall\nbe effectively guarded. Such guarding shall consist of a substantial fence or\nbarricade. As an alternative, such guarding may consist of an extension of the\nsheeting above the ground surface adjacent to the excavation to a height of at\nleast 42 inches above such adjacent street, highway or other area lawfully\nfrequented by any person. In lieu of such guarding, protection may be afforded\nby a substantial covering installed over such excavation. Such covering shall\nconsist of planking at least two inches thick full size, properly supported\nexterior grade plywood at least three-quarters inch thick or material of\nequivalent strength. Where it is possible that the movement of vehicles or\nother heavy equipment will take place over such covering, the covering shall be\nof sufficient strength to withstand such loading without structural failure of\nthe covering or of the support system. (i) Where no work is being performed in an\nunattended open excavation which has substantially vertical sides or banks\nthree feet or more in depth, such excavation shall be effectively guarded on\nall open sides regardless of the location of such excavation. Such guarding\nshall consist of a fence, a barricade or a safety railing constructed and\ninstalled in compliance with this Part (rule). As an alternative, such guarding\nmay consist of an extension of the sheeting above the excavation to a height of\nat least 42 inches above the adjacent ground, grade or equivalent level. In\nlieu of such guarding, protection may be afforded by a substantial covering\ninstalled over the excavation. Such covering shall consist of planking at least\ntwo inches thick full size, properly supported exterior grade plywood at least\nthree-quarters inch thick or material of equivalent strength. Where it is\npossible that the movement of vehicles or other heavy equipment will take place\nover such covering, the covering shall be of sufficient strength to withstand\nsuch loading without structural failure of the covering or of the support\nsystem. (j) Temporary sheet piling\ninstalled in an excavation to permit the construction of a retaining or\nstructural wall shall be left in place until such wall has developed adequate\nstrength to support any load intended to be imposed upon such wall. (k) Persons shall not be suffered or\npermitted to work in any area where they may be struck or endangered by any\nexcavation equipment or by any material being dislodged by or falling from such\nequipment. (l) The sides of any\nexcavation in stable rock may be vertical and are not required to be provided\nwith sheeting and shoring. Such sides shall be scaled and kept free of all\nloose rock or material that may be dislodged or may fall into such\nexcavation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
