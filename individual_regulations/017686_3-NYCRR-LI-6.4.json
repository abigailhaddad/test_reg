  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 6.4 - Preemption of part of banking law section 352(e) by section 2125(c) of the vehicle and traffic law\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Banking\n\nDepartment was asked whether section\n2125\n(c) and section\n2123\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which became effective on July 1, 1972, impliedly repealed section\n352\n(e) of the Banking Law, which permits a\nlicensed lender to charge a borrower the cost of filing fees for the perfection\nof a lien on an automobile or to include it in the lender's charge to the\nborrower. (1)\n\nSection\n2123\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that the method provided in this\narticle of perfecting and giving notice of security interests subject to this\narticle is exclusive. Security interests subject to this article are hereby\nexempted from the provisions of law which otherwise relate to the perfection of\nsecurity interests. (2)\n\nOn the\nsubject of fees, section 2125(c) directs that the fee for filing a notice of\nsecurity interest shall be paid by the party secured and such fee shall not be\ncharged to the owner in any manner. (b) The quoted provisions have not been the\nsubject of judicial construction, but a literal reading of the statutory\nlanguage indicates that the Legislature intended for them to be exclusive. The\nfiling fee for perfection of a lien on a vehicle must be paid by the \"party\nsecured\", which, in this case, is the lender. An owner of the vehicle may not\nbe charged for the cost of filing the notice of security. Section 2101(g)\ndefines \"owner\" to mean \"a person, other than a lienholder, having the property\nin or title to a vehicle\". Consequently, a lienholder cannot be the \"owner\" of\na vehicle. (c) If the borrower is\nthe owner of the automobile which is the subject of the security notice, there\nwill be a clear conflict between section\n2125\n(c) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and\nsection\n352\n(e) of the Banking Law. (d) The laws enacting sections\n2123\nand\n2125\n(c) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law contain no\nexpress repeal of section 352(e). Whether or not they impliedly repealed it\ndepends on the legislative intent. It should be noted, in this connection, that\nan implied repeal of a special law, by a subsequent general statute, is not to\nbe presumed, Where the two statutes are so completely inconsistent that they\ncannot operate together, however, an implied repeal will be deemed to\noccur. (e) In this case the\n\nLegislature has clearly indicated its intent in the statute itself by providing\nin section\n2123\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law that the procedure set forth therein shall be\nexclusive, reflecting an intent to render all prior inconsistent provisions\ninapplicable. Section 2125(c)'s directive that the filing fee shall be paid by\nthe party secured and not charged to the owner is patently inconsistent with\nsection 352(e). To the extent that section\n352\n(e) of the Banking Law is not in accord with\nsection\n2125\n(c) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, therefore, it has been abrogated. (f) As a result, it is no longer permissible\nfor a licensed lender to charge the costs of filing a notice of security\ninterest on a post 1972 model automobile to the borrower/owner.[FN*]\n[FN*] § 2102(a)(10) excludes from the new law any vehicle\nmanufactured or assembled prior to January 1, 1973 and any designated as a 1972\nor earlier model.
