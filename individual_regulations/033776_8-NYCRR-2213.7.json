  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2213.7 - Fixed rate program loans\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The interest rate or rates for fixed rate program loans expected to be sold to\nthe agency, or to another public benefit corporation, shall be based on the\ninterest rate payable on the bonds issued by the agency, or other public\nbenefit corporation, to fund the loan purchases. The interest rate or rates on\nfixed rate program loans shall be determined by the corporation, and with\nrespect to program loans that are otherwise eligible for purchase by a public\nbenefit corporation shall be determined by such public benefit corporation, on\nat least an annual basis with respect to program loans to be made for the\nfollowing academic year, or portion thereof, after taking into account\napplicable financial market conditions. (b) The corporation shall notify lenders and\nschools after the establishment of the new rate. Such notification shall\ninclude publication on the corporation's website. The requirements set forth in\nsection\n2213.5\n(g) of this\n\nPart shall be satisfied prior to the sale of any fixed rate program loan to the\nagency. (c) Allocation of fixed\nrate program loans. (1)\n\nAvailable amounts. The corporation, in consultation with the agency, shall determine, on an annual\nbasis, the amount of funding that will be available for fixed rate program\nloans eligible for sale to the agency based on the agency's determination as to\navailable bond proceeds and based on projected statewide demand for fixed rate\nprogram loans. Such amount shall be publicly available on the corporation's\nwebsite. (2)\n\nFunding pools. Upon\nthe determination of the available amounts of fixed rate program loans as set\nforth above, the corporation shall establish multiple fixed rate program loan\nfunding pools to promote equitable distribution of fixed rate program loan\nfunds to students throughout the state (region-based pools) and to ensure the\navailability of fixed rate program loan funds to students demonstrating\nfinancial need (income-based pool): (i) in\nestablishing the income-based pool for the initial academic year, the\ncorporation shall project demand for fixed rate program loans using tuition\nassistance program (TAP) data from the prior academic year and other available\ndata that would reasonably demonstrate financial need; (ii)\nfor subsequent academic years, the\ncorporation shall project demand for the income-based pool using actual program\nloan experience and any other available data that would reasonably demonstrate\nfinancial need; (iii)\nthe available\namounts of funding, based on projected demand, for the income-based pool shall\nbe subtracted from the total available amounts of fixed rate program loan\nfunding for the academic year; (iv)\nthe remainder of available amounts of funding for the region-based pool shall\nbe allocated based on a formula to be determined by the corporation, in\nconsultation with the agency. Such allocation shall ensure, to the extent\npracticable, distribution among students statewide based on factors including\ncollege type and level of study. The corporation may consider other factors as\nnecessary to ensure equitable distribution of fixed rate program\nloans; (v) during each application\nperiod, the corporation may adjust initial pool allocations based on fixed rate\nprogram loan application approvals within the region-based and income-based\npools as necessary to maximize the use of total available amounts for fixed\nrate program loans for the academic year. Otherwise qualifying borrowers\ndemonstrating financial need, as defined by the corporation in subdivision (c)\nof this section, shall receive fixed rate program loans from the income-based\npool. If actual demand for loans from the income-based pool exceeds the\nallocated amount, such otherwise qualifying borrowers shall be eligible to\nreceive fixed rate program loans from any remaining available funds in the\nborrower's region-based pool. A borrower's eligibility for available amounts\nfrom a region-based pool shall be based on the borrower's place of residence\nwithin New York State. If actual demand for fixed rate program loans from the\nincome-based pool is less than the available amounts allocated to or for such\npool, the corporation may reallocate fixed rate program loan funds for the\nacademic year to one or more region-based pools to maximize the use of total\nfunds available for fixed rate program loans. If actual demand for fixed rate\nprogram loans in a region-based pool is less than the available amounts\nallocated for that region, the corporation may reallocate fixed rate program\nloan funds for the academic year to the income-based pool or another\nregion-based pool to maximize the use of total funds available for fixed rate\nprogram loans.
