  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5118.4 - Validation of vouchers\n\nState Regulations\n\nValidation and payment by voucher as a method of credit\nredemption shall be permissible only by a commission approved device that is\nlinked to the central system that permits validation of such voucher. Validation approval or related information shall be generated by the central\nsystem in order to validate tickets. Vouchers may be validated only at\nlocations approved in writing by the commission. (a) A prize form shall be filed in the name\nof a single legal entity as claimant, either one individual or one\norganization. Multiple payees are not permitted, except as may be authorized\npursuant to subdivision (c) of this section. (b) If a claim is erroneously entered with\nmultiple claimants, the claimants shall designate one of them as the individual\nrecipient of the prize, or, if such claimants fail to designate an individual\nrecipient, the commission may designate any one of the claimants as the sole\nrecipient. In either case, the claim shall then be considered as if such claim\nwere originally entered in the name of the designated individual and payment of\nany prizes won shall be made to that single individual. (c) Under exceptional circumstances, payment\nmay be made to multiple payees at the discretion of the commission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5118.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
