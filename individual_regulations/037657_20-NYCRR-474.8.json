  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 474.8 - Trip permits\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 502(1)(d)\n(a) As provided herein, any carrier who\noccasionally operates a motor vehicle, otherwise subject to the provisions of\nthis Subchapter, on the public highways of New York State may apply to the\n\nCommissioner of Taxation and Finance for a trip permit for such motor vehicle. A trip permit shall be in lieu of the Highway Use Tax (HUT) permit and sticker\nissued pursuant to the authority of section\n502 (1)(a)\nof the Tax Law, but shall not be in place of the Automotive Fuel Carrier (AFC) permit and\nsticker required by section\n502 (1)(c)\nof the Tax Law. The issuance of a trip permit will exempt the carrier from the requirements of\nfiling returns and paying the taxes imposed pursuant to article 21 of the Tax\n\nLaw, for the period in which such permit is in effect, with respect to the\noperation of the motor vehicle for which the permit is issued. A trip permit\nwill be valid for a period of 72 hours from the time of its issuance as\ndescribed in subdivision (c) of this section. (b) (1)\n\nExcept as provided for in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, an application for\na trip permit shall be made on a form prescribed by the Department of Taxation\nand Finance for such purpose and must contain all of the information required\ntherein. The application must be mailed to: Department of Taxation and Finance\n\nRegistration Section\n\nPermit Unit\nW.A. Harriman Campus\n\nAlbany, NY 12227-0163\n\nSuch application must be accompanied by a fee of $25 for\nthe motor vehicle to be operated pursuant to a trip permit on the public\nhighways of the State. The fee must be paid by certified check (or other\nguaranteed draft acceptable to the department) or money order, made payable to\nthe Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. A complete application for a trip\npermit, together with the proper fee, must be received by the department at\nleast 30 days prior to the 72-hour period for which such permit is to be in\neffect. If an application and fee are received by the department after such\nperiod, the application may be denied and returned, with the fee, to the\ncarrier. Such denial will not be grounds for the automatic suspension, revocation or denial of all of the carrier's permits as described in paragraph\n(c)(1) of this section nor shall it preclude the carrier from reapplying for\nsuch trip permit in accordance with paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nAny carrier\nrequiring the expeditious issuance of a trip permit, in lieu of applying\ndirectly to the Department of Taxation and Finance as described in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision, may apply for such a permit through a permit service\nauthorized by the department to issue trip permits in its behalf. (3)\n\nRegardless of the method of application, a carrier may not apply for more than 10 trip permits during any single\ncalendar year. Provided further, no refund application may be filed with\nrespect to any trip permit applications. (c) The Department of Taxation and Finance\nwill either deny or approve each application for a trip permit. In the event a\ncarrier is denied a trip permit, the permit fee shall be returned to the\ncarrier. (1)\nA trip permit may be denied if a\ncarrier has violated any provisions of article 21 of the Tax Law. A trip permit\nwill be denied if the carrier has failed to file a return or failed to pay any\nmonies due under such article. The denial, suspension or revocation of a trip\npermit or any other permits issued to a carrier pursuant to article 21\nautomatically results in the suspension or revocation of all such permits\nissued to the carrier and the denial of any applications for such permits\nunless otherwise specified by the Department of Taxation and Finance. (2)\n(i) Upon approval of an application for a trip permit, the department will issue to\nthe carrier, or will have issued to the carrier in its behalf, a trip permit. Such permit will set forth the carrier's name and address, vehicle\nidentification number, the period of time for which such permit is valid and\nany additional information as may be required by the department. (ii)\n(a) A\ntrip permit is valid for a period of 72 hours from the time of its issuance. For purposes of determining the period of time for which a trip permit is\nvalid, 72 hours from the time of the permit's issuance\nis\ndeemed to be that period of time commencing with a specific date and time\nsanctioned by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance and terminating with a\nspecific date and time so sanctioned. (b) Such 72-hour period shall not be extended\nby Saturdays, Sundays nor public holidays. Accordingly, it is incumbent on the\ncarrier to obtain a sufficient quantity of trip permits (not to exceed 10 in a\ncalendar year) to entitle the carrier to operate a motor vehicle on the public\nhighways of this State for the entire period of time for which such carrier\nwill do so. Example: A carrier plans to make a single trip into New York\n\nState. The trip permit which will be in effect when the carrier first enters\nthe State will expire on a Saturday, 24 hours prior to the time that the\ncarrier will leave the State. Accordingly, such carrier must obtain two trip\npermits in order to assure its compliance with article 21 of the Tax\n\nLaw. (d) (1)\nA trip permit as described in this\nsection must be carried in the motor vehicle for which the permit is issued\nduring the 72-hour period in which it is in effect. (2)\nA carrier must retain, in its records, a\ncopy of the trip permit in order to establish its exemption from the\nrequirements of filing returns and paying the taxes imposed pursuant to article\n21 of Tax Law, in respect of such permit. Trip permits must be preserved for a\nperiod of four years from their termination dates. (e) (1)\n(1)\n\nThe provisions of this section\nshall not be used to circumvent the Highway Use Tax permit structure provided\nfor in section 502 of article 21 of the Tax Law nor in violation of any other\nprovisions of such article or of any rules or regulations promulgated\nthereunder. Such a misuse or violation will constitute sufficient cause for\nsuspension or revocation of any and all of a carrier's permits and will subject\nthe carrier to the punishments or criminal penalties imposed pursuant to\nsection 1815 of article 37 of the Tax Law, as well as, any applicable penalties\nprovided for in the Penal Law or elsewhere. (2)\n\nNothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as authorizing the operation of motor vehicles in excess of the legal\nweight limits on the public highways of New York State. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
