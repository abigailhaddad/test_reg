  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 156.7 - Calculation of nonallowable pupil deduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In those instances in which a school\ndistrict provides transportation services, by district-owned, leased, or\ncontracted school buses, a nonallowable pupil deduction shall be calculated for\npurposes of determining aid pursuant to section\n3602\nof the\n\nEducation Law, for transportation expenses incurred in the 1990-91 school year\nand each school year thereafter, pursuant to this paragraph. (1)\n\nThe calculation of the nonallowable pupil\ndeduction for each school district shall be as follows: the dollar amount of\nthe district's nonallowable pupil deduction for expenses for transportation\nservices, by district-owned, leased, or contracted school buses, incurred in\neach of the school years 1987- 88, 1988-89, and 1989-90, as audited and\nconfirmed by the Education Department, shall be summed, with such sum divided\nby the sum of the district's net transportation expenses related to mileage\ntravelled by district-owned, leased, or contracted school buses for the three\nyears, with the result expressed as a decimal to four places without rounding. This nonallowable pupil decimal shall be calculated by the Education Department\nfor each district, and shall be reported to each district by July 1, 1991. Net\ntransportation expense for purposes of this paragraph shall be the total\nexpense attributable to transportation service to and from school and BOCES\nprograms, for which an apportionment is provided pursuant to article 65, 73 or\n89 of the Education Law, excluding the expenses attributable to other purpose\ntransportation. (2)\n\nIn calculating\naid to be paid in each school year commencing in school year 1991-92, the\nnonallowable pupil decimal calculated in paragraph (1) of this subdivision\nshall be multiplied by net transportation expense of the base year to determine\nnonallowable expense. Such nonallowable expense shall be deducted from net\ntransportation expense to determine the allowable transportation expense for\ntransportation aid. (3)\n(i) A school district shall provide\ndocumentation to the commissioner for the calculation of a new nonallowable\npupil decimal at least once every three years, on a schedule prescribed by the\ncommissioner, using the nonallowable pupil decimal worksheet prescribed by the\ncommissioner; and in addition, a school district shall provide such\ndocumentation during any school year in which the district experiences an\nincrease or decrease from the nonallowable pupil decimal previously calculated\npursuant to this section, when any one or more of the following conditions\napply: (a) change in school district\ntransportation eligibility policy; (b) school district reorganization with one\nor more other districts; (c) opening of a school building or closing of a building currently used as a\nschool building; (d) an error made\nby either the school district or the Education Department in the calculation of\na nonallowable pupil decimal for a prior year; or\n(e) a change in school district\ntransportation policy to provide transportation of eligible children to or from\na universal prekindergarten program pursuant to section 3602-3 of the Education\n\nLaw. (ii)\n\nUpon receipt\nof such documentation, the commissioner shall calculate a new nonallowable\npupil decimal by dividing the total number of pupil miles of transportation\nservices provided to nonallowable pupils on all district-owned, leased, or\ncontracted school buses during the school year reported by the total number of\npupil miles of transportation services provided to all pupils on all\ndistrict-owned, leased, or contracted school buses during such school year, with the result expressed as decimal to four places without rounding. The\nnumber of pupil miles of transportation services provided to pupils attending\nan approved prekindergarten program pursuant to section\n3602-e\nof the\n\nEducation Law shall be excluded for the purposes of such calculation, provided\nthat the transportation services furnished to such prekindergarten pupils are\nprovided on a space-available basis and do not require, or result in: (a) any expansion of approved bus routes or\nadditional trips; or\n(b) any\nincrease in contracted expenditures for transportation expenses; or\n(c) any purchase or lease of additional\nvehicles. (iii)\n\nThe new\nnonallowable pupil decimal shall be used in calculating transportation aid in\neach school year after the school year in which such documentation is provided, in lieu of the decimal previously calculated pursuant to this\nsection. (b) For purposes of calculating transportation aid pursuant to section\n3602\nof\n\nEducation Law, for school districts using public service carriers, the\ndeduction for nonallowable pupils shall be the actual expenditures for\ntransporting such pupils.
