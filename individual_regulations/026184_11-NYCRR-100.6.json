Tit. 11 § 100.6 - Applicability of the 2001 CSO Mortality Table and the 2017 CSO Mortality Table to Part 98 of this Title (Insurance Regulation 147)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The 2001 CSO Mortality Table may be used in applying Part 98 of this Title in the following manner, subject to the transition dates for use of the 2001 CSO Mortality Table in section\n100.4\nof this Part: (1)\n\nSection\n98.4\n(a)(1)(i)\nof this Title: The valuation mortality table used in determining the tabular cost of insurance shall be the ultimate mortality rates in the 2001 CSO Mortality Table. (2)\n\nSection\n98.4\n(a)(3)\nof this Title: The 2001 CSO Mortality Table is the minimum mortality standard for basic reserves. For varying premium term life insurance issued on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2017, or on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2020 if optionally elected under section\n100.11\n(b) of this Part, recognition of mortality improvement, as specified in section\n100.11\nof this Part, may also be applied. For universal life policies that guarantee that coverage will remain in force as long as the accumulation of premiums paid satisfies the secondary guarantee requirement, issued on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2017, or on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2020 if optionally elected under section\n100.12\n(b) of this Part, recognition of mortality improvement, as specified in section\n100.12\nof this Part, may also be applied. (3)\n\nSection\n98.4\n(b)(5)\nof this Title: The 2001 CSO Mortality Table is the minimum mortality standard for deficiency reserves.

If select mortality rates are used, they may be multiplied by X percent for durations in the first segment, subject to the conditions specified in section\n98.4\n(b)(5)(i) - (vii)\nof this Title. In demonstrating compliance with those conditions, the demonstrations shall not combine the results of tests across different mortality tables (e.g. the results of tests that utilize the 1980 CSO Mortality Table shall not be combined with the results of tests that utilize the 2001 CSO Mortality Table), unless the combination is explicitly required by regulation or necessary to be in compliance with relevant Actuarial Standards of Practice. (4)\n\nSection\n98.4\n(f)(2)(i)\nof this Title: The calculations specified in section\n98.4\n(f)(2)\nof this Title shall use the ultimate mortality rates in the 2001 CSO Mortality Table.

(6)\n\nSection\n98.5\nof this Title: All calculations are made using the 2001 CSO Mortality rate, and, if elected, the optional minimum mortality standard for deficiency reserves stipulated in paragraph (4) of this subdivision. The value of \"qx+k+t-1\" is the valuation mortality rate for deficiency reserves in policy year kkt, but using the unmodified select mortality rates if modified select mortality rates are used in the computation of deficiency reserves. (7)\n\nSection\n98.6\n(a)(4)\nof this Title: The select and ultimate mortality rates in the 2001 CSO Mortality Table may only be used for the first segment. Ultimate mortality rates in the 2001 CSO Mortality Table shall be used for the second and later segments. For varying premium term life insurance issued on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2017, or on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2020 if optionally elected under section\n100.11\n(b) of this Part, recognition of mortality improvement, as specified in section\n100.11\nof this Part, may also be applied.
