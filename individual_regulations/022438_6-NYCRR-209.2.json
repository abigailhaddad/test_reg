  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 209.2 - Emissions of total fluorides\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\nperson will cause or allow emissions of total fluorides to the outdoor\natmosphere from any potroom group at a primary aluminum reduction plant for\nwhich an application for a permit to construct was received by the commissioner\nbefore October 24, 1974, and which is not applicable to Subpart S, 40 CFR\n60, in excess of: (1)\n4.3 pounds per ton of\naluminum produced at Soderberg plants; or\n(2)\n4.2 pounds per ton of aluminum produced\nat prebake plants. (b) No\nperson will cause or allow emissions of total fluorides to the outdoor\natmosphere from any furnace at an anode bake plant for which an application for\na permit to construct was received by the commissioner before October 24, 1974, in excess of 0.40 pounds per ton of aluminum equivalent. (c) The owner or operator of a primary\naluminum reduction plant for which an application for a permit to construct was\nreceived by the commissioner before October 24, 1974, and which is not\napplicable to Subpart S, 40 CFR\n60\n(see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), may develop a\nfacility-wide emission reduction plan for fluorides instead of having each\nemission point comply with the permissible emissions prescribed in subdivisions\n(a) and (b) of this section, provided that: (1)\nthe owner or operator demonstrates to the\nsatisfaction of the commissioner that the total emission of fluorides from the\nfacility will not exceed the mathematical sum of emissions that would be\nallowed from the potroom groups and anode bake plant furnaces; and\n(2)\nthe facility-wide emission reduction plan\nincludes an emission test protocol acceptable to the commissioner as determined\non a case-by-case basis. (d) No person will cause or allow emissions\nof total fluorides to the outdoor atmosphere from any potroom group at a\nprimary aluminum reduction plant for which an application for a permit to\nconstruct was received by the commissioner after October 23, 1974, in excess\nof: (1)\n2.0 pounds per ton of aluminum\nproduced at Soderberg plants; or\n(2)\n1.9 pounds per ton of aluminum produced\nat prebake plants. (e) No\nperson will cause or allow emissions of total fluorides to the outdoor\natmosphere from any furnance at an anode bake plant for which an application\nfor a permit to construct was received by the commissioner after October 23, 1974, in excess of 0.10 pounds per ton of aluminum equivalent. (f) Emission test methods for plants for\nwhich an application for a permit to construct was received by the commissioner\nbefore October 24, 1974, will be determined by the commissioner on a\ncase-by-case basis taking into account technical and economic\nfeasibility.
