  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 600.6 - Selection of apprentices\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Obligation of sponsors. In addition to the development of a written affirmative\naction plan to ensure that minorities and women have an equal opportunity for\nselection as apprentices and otherwise ensure the prompt achievement of full\nand equal opportunity in apprenticeship, each sponsor shall further provide in\nits affirmative action program that the selection of apprentices shall be made\nunder one of the methods specified in subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (b) Selection methods. The\nsponsor shall adopt one of the following methods for selecting apprentices: (1)\n\nSelection on basis of rank from pool of\neligible applicants. (i) Selection. A sponsor\nmay select apprentices from a pool of eligible applicants created in accordance\nwith the requirements of subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph on the basis of\nthe rank order of scores of applicants on one or more qualification standards\nwhere there is a significant statistical relationship between rank order of\nscores and performance in the apprenticeship program. In demonstrating such\nrelationship, the sponsor shall follow the procedures set forth in guidelines\non employee selection procedures published in 41 CFR\n60.3. (ii)\n\nRequirements. The sponsor adopting this\nmethod of selecting apprentices shall meet the requirements of subparagraphs\n(iii) through (vi) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nCreation of pool of eligibles. A pool\nof eligibles shall be created from applicants who meet the qualifications of\nminimum legal working age or from applicants who meet qualification standards\nin addition to minimum legal working age; provided, that any additional\nqualification standards conform with the following requirements: (a) Qualification standards. The\nqualification standards, and the procedures for determining such qualification\nstandards, shall be stated in detail and shall provide criteria for the\nspecific factors and attributes to be considered in evaluating applicants for\nadmission to the pool. The score required under each qualification standard for\nadmission to the pool shall also be specified. All qualification standards, and\nthe score required on any standard for admission to the pool, shall be directly\nrelated to job performance, as shown by a significant statistical relationship\nbetween the score required for admission to the pool, and performance in the\napprenticeship program. In demonstrating such relationship, the sponsor shall\nfollow the procedures set forth in 41 CFR\n60.3. Qualifications shall be\nconsidered as separately required so that the failure of an applicant to attain\nthe specified score under a single qualification standard shall disqualify the\napplicant from admission to the pool. (b) Aptitude tests. Any qualification\nstandard for admission to the pool consisting of aptitude test scores shall be\ndirectly related to job performance, as shown by significant statistical\nrelationships between the score on the aptitude tests required for admission to\nthe pool, and performance in the apprenticeship program. In determining such\nrelationship, the sponsor shall follow the procedures set forth in 41 CFR\n60.3. These requirements shall also be applicable to aptitude tests utilized by a\nprogram sponsor which are administered by the State employment service or any\nother person, agency or organization engaged in the selection or evaluation of\npersonnel. A national test developed and administered by a national joint\napprenticeship committee will not be approved by the commissioner unless such\ntest meets the requirements of this Part. (c) Educational attainments. All educational\nattainments or achievements as qualifications for admission to the pool shall\nbe directly related to job performance as shown by a significant statistical\nrelationship between the score required for admission to the pool, and\nperformance in the apprenticeship program. In demonstrating such relationship, the sponsor shall meet the requirements of 41 CFR\n60.3. School records or a\npassing grade on the general education development tests recognized by the\n\nState or local public instruction authority shall be evidence of educational\nachievement. Education requirements shall be applied uniformly to all\napplicants. (d) Oral interviews. Oral interviews shall not be used as a qualification standard for admission\ninto an eligibility pool. However, once an applicant is placed in the\neligibility pool, and prior to selection for apprenticeship from the pool, he\nor she may be required to submit to an oral interview. Oral interviews shall be\nlimited to such objective questions as may be required to determine the fitness\nof applicants to enter the apprenticeship program, but shall not include\nquestions relating to qualifications previously determined in gaining entrance\nto the eligibility pool. When an oral interview is used, each interviewer shall\nrecord the questions and the general nature of the applicant's answers, and\nshall prepare a summary of any conclusions. Each applicant rejected from the\npool of eligibles on the basis of an oral interview shall be given a written\nstatement of such rejection, the reasons therefor, and the appeal rights\navailable to the applicant. (iv)\n\nNotification of applicants. All\napplicants who meet the requirements for admission shall be notified and placed\nin the eligibility pool. The program sponsor shall give each rejected applicant\nwho is not selected for the pool or the program notice of his or her rejection, including the reasons for the rejection, the requirements for admission to the\npool of eligibles, and the appeal rights available to the applicant. (v) Goals and timetables. The sponsor shall\nestablish where required by section\n600.5\n(d) of this\n\nPart, percentage goals and timetables for the admission of minorities and women\n(minority and nonminority) into the pool of eligibles, in accordance with the\nprovisions of section\n600.5\n(d)-(f)\nof\nthis Part. (vi)\n\nCompliance. A\nsponsor shall be deemed to be in compliance with its commitments under\nsubparagraph (v) of this paragraph if it meets its goals or timetables or if it\nmakes a good faith effort to meet these goals and timetables. In the event of\nthe failure of the sponsor to meet its goals and timetables, it shall be given\nan opportunity to demonstrate that it has made every good faith effort to meet\nits commitments (see section\n600.5\n[f]\nof this\n\nPart). All the actions of the sponsor shall be reviewed and evaluated in\ndetermining whether such good faith efforts have been made. (2)\n\nRandom selection from pool of\neligible applicants. (i) Selection. A sponsor\nmay select apprentices from a pool of eligible applicants on a random basis. The method of random selection is subject to approval by the commissioner. Supervision of the random selection process shall be by an impartial person or\npersons selected by the sponsor, but not associated with the administration of\nthe apprenticeship program. The time and place of the selection, and the number\nof apprentices to be selected, shall be announced. The place of the selection\nshall be open to all applicants and the public. The names of apprentices drawn\nby this method shall be posted immediately following the selection at the\nprogram sponsor's place of business. (ii)\n\nRequirements. The sponsor adopting this\nmethod of selecting apprentices shall meet the requirements of subparagraphs\n(iii) through (v) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision relating to the creation\nof pool of eligibles, oral interviews and notification of applicants. (iii)\n\nGoals and timetables. The sponsor shall\nestablish, where required by subdivision (d) of section\n600.5\nof this Part, percentage\ngoals and timetables for admission of minorities and women (minority and\nnonminority) into the pool of eligibles in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivisions (d) through (f) of section\n600.5\nof this Part. (iv)\n\nCompliance. Determinations as to the\nsponsor's compliance with its obligations under this Part shall be in\naccordance with provisions of subparagraph (1)(vi) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nSelection from pool of current employees. (i) Selection. A sponsor may select apprentices from an eligibility pool of the\nworkers already employed by the program sponsor in a manner prescribed by a\ncollective bargaining agreement where such exists, or by the sponsor's\nestablished promotion policy. The sponsor adopting this method of selecting\napprentices shall establish goals and timetables for the selection of minority\nand female apprentices, unless the sponsor concludes in accordance with the\nprovisions of subdivisions (d) through (f) of section\n600.5\nof this Part that it does\nnot have deficiencies in terms of underutilization of minorities and/or women\n(minority and nonminority) in the apprenticeship of journeyperson crafts\nrepresented by the program. (ii)\n\nCompliance. Determinations as to the sponsor's compliance with its obligations\nunder this Part shall be in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph\n(1)(vi) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nAlternative selection methods. (i) Selection. A sponsor may select\napprentices by means of any other method including its present selection\nmethod; provided, that the sponsor meets the following requirements: (a) Selection method and goals and\ntimetables. Within 30 days of the effective date of this Part the sponsor shall\ncomplete development of the revised selection method it proposes to use along\nwith the rest of its written affirmative action program including, where\nrequired by subdivision (d) of section\n600.5\nof this Part its percentage\ngoals and timetables for the selection of minority and/or female (minority and\nnonminority) applicants for apprenticeship and its written analysis, upon which\nsuch goals and timetables, or lack thereof, are based. The establishment of\ngoals and timetables shall be in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions\n(d) through (f) of section\n600.5\nof this Part. The sponsor\nmay not implement any such selection method until the commissioner has approved\nthe selection method as meeting the requirements of clause (b) of this\nsubparagraph and has approved the remainder of its affirmative action program\nincluding its goals and timetables. If the commissioner fails to act upon the\nselection method and the affirmative action program within 30 days of its\nsubmission, the sponsor then may implement the selection method. (b) Qualification standards. Apprentices\nshall be selected on the basis of objective and specific qualification\nstandards. Examples of such standards are fair aptitude tests, school diplomas\nor equivalent, occupationally essential health requirements, fair interviews, school grades and previous work experience. Where interviews are used, adequate\nrecords shall be kept including a brief summary of each interview and the\nconclusions on each of the specific factors, e.g., motivation, ambition and\nwillingness to accept direction which are part of the total judgment. In\napplying any such standards, the sponsor shall meet the requirements of 41 CFR\nPart\n60-3. (ii)\n\nCompliance. Determinations as to the sponsor's compliance with its obligations\nunder this Part shall be in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph\n(1)(vi) of this subdivision. Where a sponsor, despite its good faith efforts, fails to meet its goals and timetables within a reasonable period of time the\nsponsor may be required to make appropriate changes in its affirmative action\nprogram to the extent necessary to obtain maximum effectiveness toward the\nattainment of its goals. The sponsor may also be required to develop and adopt\nan alternative selection method, including a method prescribed by the\ncommissioner, where it is determined that the failure of the sponsor to meet\nits goals is attributable in substantial part to the selection method. Where\nthe sponsor's failure to meet its goals is attributable in substantial part to\nits use of a qualification standard which has adversely affected the\nopportunities of minorities and/or women (minority and nonminority) for\napprenticeship, the sponsor may be required to demonstrate that such\nqualification standard is directly related to job performance, in accordance\nwith the provisions of clause (1)(iii)(a) of this subdivision.
