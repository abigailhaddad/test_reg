  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2385.2 - Income data\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Paragraph (k) of subdivision 1 of section\n3602, of the Education Law requires\ncomputation of the income data for the alternate pupil wealth ratio. Such\nincome data shall consist of: (1)\n\nNew York\n\nState's adjusted gross income; and\n(2)\nthe district's adjusted gross\nincome. (b) Determination of New York State's adjusted gross income. New York State's\nadjusted gross income shall be determined by adding together the amounts of New\n\nYork adjusted gross incomes of resident individuals reported by such\nindividuals on New York State resident personal income tax returns on which a\ncounty of residence was also reported. Such returns shall be those for calendar\nyears two years prior to the calendar year in which the current school year\ncommences, and in the case of taxpayers reporting on a fiscal basis other than\na calendar year, for taxable years ending in the calendar year (but no later\nthan December 31st of such calendar year) one year prior to the calendar year\nin which the current school year commences. However, only those returns shall\nbe considered which were processed prior and up to the date set forth in the\nreport required to be submitted in accordance with section\n2385.3\nof this Part. Such date shall be no later than January 17th of the calendar\nyear in which the current school year commences. A return shall be deemed to be\nprocessed if such return was filed and the information on such return, including the income data appearing on such return, has been stored in a\ncomputer operated by the Department of Taxation and Finance in such a manner\nthat access to such income data is readily available. (c) Determination of district's adjusted\ngross income. (1)\n\nThe district's adjusted\ngross income shall be determined by: (i) ascertaining the resident personal income tax returns, includable in\ndetermining New York State's adjusted gross income in accordance with\nsubdivision (b) of this section, on which taxpayers have clearly indicated, in\nthe manner provided for by such returns, the school districts in which they are\nresidents; and\n(ii)\nadding together\nfor each school district all the amounts of New York adjusted gross incomes of\nresident individuals reported on the returns ascertained under subparagraph (i)\nof this paragraph, on which that same school district was clearly\nindicated. (2)\n(i) A school district shall be deemed to have\nbeen clearly indicated only if: (a) a school\ndistrict code number required to be set forth by the taxpayer in his return is\nclearly set forth on such return that is, in the manner provided for in such\nreturn and in the instructions for filing such return; and\n(b) that school district code number is the\ncode number of a school district located in whole or in part in the county\nwhich was stated on the return to be the taxpayer's county of\nresidence. (ii)\n\nWhere\nthe school district is clearly indicated on the return in accordance with the\nprovisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the name of a school district\nshall be disregarded, and the fact that the name of a school district has been\nomitted, or is other than the one to which the code number clearly set forth on\nthe return has been assigned, shall not be considered. Example:Assume that on the instructions for filing resident\npersonal income tax returns, the Albany school district, which is located in\n\nAlbany County, has been assigned code number 005, the Bethlehem school\ndistrict, also in Albany County, has been assigned code number 051, and the\n\nAlfred Almond school district, which is located in Allegany County, has been\nassigned code number 010. Of those returns in which taxpayers have reported\n\nAlbany County as the county of residence and have clearly set forth the code\nnumber 005 (the code number for the Albany school district), most are those on\nwhich taxpayers have set forth Albany as the name of the school district, some\nare returns on which taxpayers have not set forth the name of a school\ndistrict, and others are returns on which taxpayers have stated \"Bethlehem\"\n(located in Albany County) and still others have stated \"Alfred Almond\"\n(located in Allegany County) to be the name of their school district. Since the\nschool district has been clearly indicated as the one bearing code number 005\nand is assigned to a school district (the Albany school district) located in\nthe county stated to be the county of residence (Albany County) all the returns\nwill be assigned to the Albany school district, regardless of whether the\nschool district name was set forth or set forth as the name of a school\ndistrict other than \"Albany\" school district. (iii)\n\nFor school years commencing on or after\n\nJuly 1, 1982: (a) where the code number set\nforth in a return for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1980 is\nnot one assigned to a school district located in whole or in part in the county\nwhich was stated on the return to be the taxpayer's county of residence, but\nthe name of a school district located in such county has been clearly set forth\nin the return; or\n(b) where a\ndistrict code number is not set forth in the return, but the name of a school\ndistrict is clearly set forth in the return and is located in whole or in part\nin the county which was stated on the return to be the taxpayer's county of\nresidence, the return may be considered one in which the school district was\nclearly indi cated. Example:Assume that the code numbers assigned to various\nschool districts are the same for 1979 and 1980 returns and, as in the above\nexample, that the code number of the Albany school district located in Albany\n\nCounty is 005, that of Bethlehem school district, also located in Albany\n\nCounty, is 051 and that of Alfred Almond school district located in Allegany\n\nCounty is 010. Of those returns on which taxpayers have reported Albany County\nas their county of residence and have named \"Bethlehem\" as a school district, some are returns on which the code number 005 (the code number for the Albany\nschool district located in Albany County) has been indicated, others are\nreturns on which the code number 010 (the code number for the Alfred Almond\nschool district located in Allegany County) has been indicated, and still\nothers are returns which do not contain any school district code number. As\nconcluded in the previous example, those returns on which the code number 005\nhas been indicated will be assigned to the Albany school district with respect\nto returns for both 1979 and 1980, regardless of the fact that the returns\nlisted \"Bethlehem\" as the name of the school district. The other returns, on\nwhich the code number 010 has been indicated, or which do not contain any\nschool district code number will, with respect to the 1979 returns not be\nassigned to any school district since no school district has been clearly\nindicated for such year. However, they may, with respect to the 1980 returns, be assigned to the Bethlehem school district, since for such year and\nsubsequent years, those returns may be considered returns in which the school\ndistrict was clearly indicated. (3)\n(i) Where a school district is located in more than one county, the district's\nadjusted gross income may first be determined tentatively on a county basis. In\nthat case, instead of the computation provided for in subparagraph (1)(ii) of\nthis subdivision there shall be added together all the amounts of New York\nadjusted gross incomes of resident individuals reported on the returns\nascertained under paragraph (1) of this subdivision on which both that same\nschool district was clearly indicated and the same county of residence was\nreported. The amounts so ascertained for such school district on a county basis\nshall, when added together equal the amount of such school district's adjusted\ngross income. Example:The Burnt Hills (Ballston Lake) school district is\nlocated partly in Saratoga County and partly in Schenectady County. As\nappearing on the instructions for filing 1979 resident personal income tax\nreturns, that school district has been assigned code number 074. In examining\nthe 1979 returns (including both returns for the 1979 calendar year and for\nfiscal years ending in the next calendar year but on or before December 30, 1980) in which taxpayers have indicated the school district code number 074, it\nis ascertained that some taxpayers listed Albany County as the county of\nresidence, others have listed Schenectady County as the county of residence, and the remainder have listed Saratoga County as the county of residence. The\nreturns bearing code number 074 and listing Albany County as the county of\nresidence shall not be included in determining the Burnt Hills district's\nadjusted gross income. The commissioner may include in this report either: (i) a single amount which is the\ntotal school district's adjusted gross income by examining all pertinent\nreturns on which the code number 074 is indicated by the taxpayer and on which\nreturns, either Schenectady County or Saratoga County is reported by the\ntaxpayer as the county of residence, and adding together all the New York\nadjusted gross incomes stated on the returns; or\n(ii)\ntwo separate amounts: the amount\nobtained by adding together all the New York adjusted gross incomes stated on\nreturns on which the code number 074 is listed by the taxpayer and on which\n\nSchenectady County is reported by the taxpayer as his county of residence, and\nthe amount obtained by adding together all the New York adjusted gross incomes\nstated on returns on which the code number 074 is listed by the taxpayer and on\nwhich Saratoga County is reported by the taxpayer as his county of\nresidence. (d) Where a county of residence is not\nreported on a return in the manner provided for in such return and in the\ninstructions for filing such return, but such information is readily\nascertainable from such return on which the county of residence of the taxpayer\nis clearly stated, such return may be considered to be one in which the county\nof residence was reported, and where such county is coterminous with a school\ndistrict, such return may be considered one on which the school district was\nproperly indicated. (e) Each\nborough of the City of New York shall be considered a school district located\nin the county of the State of New York which is coterminous with that\nborough. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
