  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 1-2.13 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following are examples of foreign corporations that\neither are subject to tax under article 9-A because they are doing business, or\nemploying capital, or owning or leasing property in a corporate or organized\ncapacity, or maintaining an office or deriving receipts from activity in New\n\nYork State, or are not subject to tax. Each of these examples is intended for\nillustration purposes only and to be applicable only to the specific activity\nas identified in each example. Example 1: A foreign corporation in another state\noperates or is organized for the purposes of buying and selling securities. It\ndoes not maintain a physical office anywhere, other than a statutory office in\nthe state of its incorporation. Regular and continuous purchases of securities\nare directed by its officers or agents located in New York State. The\ncorporation is subject to tax. Example 2: A foreign corporation participates in a joint\nventure that carries on business in this State, but the foreign corporation is\nnot otherwise engaged in any activities in New York State. The corporation is\nsubject to tax. Example 3: A foreign holding corporation coordinates and\nsupervises in New York State activities of a subsidiary that is taxable in New\n\nYork State. It also makes loans to its subsidiary and guarantees loans obtained\nby the subsidiary from sources other than the parent. The corporation is\nsubject to tax. Example 4: A foreign manufacturing corporation has its\nfactories and offices located outside New York State. Its sole activity in New\n\nYork State consists of holding or storing goods in a warehouse owned by an\nunrelated party. The corporation is subject to tax. Example 5: A foreign corporation that has no office or\nother place of business in New York State leases automobiles to customers in\n\nNew York State, with receipts from this activity equaling less than $1 million. The corporation is subject to tax. Example 6: A foreign corporation formerly engaged in\nmanufacturing in another state discontinues such business and transfers its\noffice to New York State, where its activities consist solely of the\nacquisition of bonds and the receipt of interest on such bonds and the holding\nof directors' meetings. The corporation is subject to tax. Example 7: A foreign corporation issues credit cards to\n500 customers with a mailing address in New York State as of the last day of\nits taxable year and has contracts with merchants covering 500 locations in New\n\nYork State to which it remits payments during the taxable year. Since the\ncorporation issues credit cards to customers with a mailing address in New York\n\nState and has merchant customer contracts that cover locations in New York\n\nState to which it remits payments for credit card transactions, and the sum of\nthe number of customers and the number of locations is 1,000, the corporation\nis subject to tax. Example 8: Three foreign corporations are part of the\nsame unitary group that meets the ownership test under section 210-C and\n\nSubpart 6-2 of this Subchapter, all of the members of which each have at least\n$10,000 of receipts from activity in New York State. They are a bank, a\nbroker-dealer, and an insurance company subject to tax under article 33. The\nbank and the broker-dealer together have $900,000 of receipts from activity in\n\nNew York State. The insurance company has $300,000 of receipts from activity in\n\nNew York State. Since the insurance company is a corporation that cannot be\nincluded in a combined report under section 210-C(2)(c) and section\n6-2.6\nof this Subchapter, its New\n\nYork receipts will not be included for purposes of determining whether the\nunitary group is deriving receipts from activity in New York State. Therefore, the bank and the broker-dealer are not subject to tax in New York State. Example 9: A foreign corporation organized as a bank in\nanother state has interest income from Federal funds, but no other New York\nreceipts. Since the corporation's only New York receipts are from interest\nincome from Federal funds, the corporation is not subject to tax. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
