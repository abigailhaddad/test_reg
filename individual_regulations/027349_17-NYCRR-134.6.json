  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 134.6 - Vegetation control requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe requirements set forth in this section are intended to\nensure that vegetation control is performed in a manner that is environmentally\nsensitive and, when completed, results in a highway right of way that is\naesthetically pleasing to highway users. The department reserves the right to\nimpose additional requirements it determines are necessary to achieve these\nobjectives or for public safety. (a) All vegetation control performed pursuant to this Part shall be as specified on\nsite plans accompanying the approved permit. Such site plans shall accompany\nthe permit application and be approved by the department and shall include such\nterms and conditions as deemed appropriate by the department to preserve the\nscenic quality and conditions of the site of the vegetation control. The site\nplans shall conform to the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe scale shall be 1:250 (metric) or of\ngreater detail. (2)\n\nExisting\nvegetation and vegetation to be controlled shall be identified, including size\nand species and condition. (3)\n\nFixed structures, including, but not limited to, the roadway, utilities, the\nadvertising sign structure, and drainage structures, shall be\nidentified. (4)\n\nThe topography, including drainage patterns, of the site shall be depicted, unless the proposed\nwork is limited to pruning. (5)\n\nLandscaping, of the site, if necessary, shall be identified, including the\nsize, location, number, and species names, as applicable. (b) The permittee shall provide photographs\ndemonstrating the condition of vegetation in the State highway right of way, relative to the advertising sign, following the completion of the permitted\nwork. (c) Any vegetation control\nperformed shall be conducted in accordance with nationally recognized\nguidelines, such as the American National Standards Institute's Pruning\n\nStandard, ANSI 300; the American National Standard for Tree Care Operations, ANSI Z133.1; and the International Society of Arboriculture's Tree Pruning\n\nGuidelines. No tree may be controlled so as to result in the tree having an\nunnatural shape that is inconsistent with that of a well-landscaped or\nmaintained example of its species. No topping of trees shall be conducted. The\nvegetation control of trees shall not include the removal of large branches or\nportions of the trunks of trees which would result in an unnatural character or\nbalance of the tree. (d) The use of\nchemical pesticides, herbicides or burning for vegetation control is\nprohibited. (e) No vegetation\ncontrol within the median of a divided highway may be permitted pursuant to\nthis Part. (f) No vegetation\ncontrol shall be conducted that results in the exposure of an unvegetated\narea. (g) Trees or other vegetation\nmay only be removed as expressly authorized in a permit issued pursuant to this\n\nPart. Trees may only be removed: (1)\nif the\ntree is dead or dying; or\n(2)\nif: (i) the tree has a trunk diameter of eight\ninches (204 mm) or less or the department determines that removal of the tree\nwould have no undesirable or adverse effect; (ii)\nthe department determines that the tree\ndirectly and significantly interferes with the view of the advertising sign in\nthe advertising signs's viewing zone; and\n(iii)\nthe department determines that the\nremoval of the tree or trees would not result in a significant change in the\nscenic quality of the view of the State highway right of way from the main\ntraveled way, relative to the advertising sign. No more than six live trees with trunk diameters over six\ninches (152 mm) may be removed from the viewing zone of a sign (or multiple\nsigns located on a common structure and facing in the same direction) pursuant\nto a permit issued pursuant to this Part. Stumps and roots shall be cut flush\nwith the ground, except that stumps and roots in lawn areas shall be removed to\nat least six inches (152 mm) below ground level. Stump holes shall be\nbackfilled. (h) Damage caused by the permittee to any\nstructure, landscaping, pavement, drainage facility, slope, shoulder or\nvegetation (planted or natural), unless expressly permitted by the department, shall be promptly corrected by the permittee at no cost to the\ndepartment.
