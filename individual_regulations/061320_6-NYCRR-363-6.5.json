Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.5 - Landfill subgrade\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The liner\nand leachate collection and removal system must be placed on a landfill\nsubgrade that consists of an in-situ soil layer or select fill that is graded\nand prepared for landfill construction. A foundation-bearing capacity, stability and settlement analysis must be performed in accordance with\nsubdivisions\n363-4.3\n(b), (c), and (d) of this Part. (b) Materials\nrequired. The landfill subgrade material must be free of visible organic\nmaterial and consist of on-site soils, or select fill approved by the\ndepartment. There must be a minimum thickness approved, pursuant to section\n363-6.4\nof this Part, below the\nlandfill liner system consisting of low permeability soils with silty and\nclayey characteristics and which exhibit no large-scale, permeable deposits\nwhich could result in migration of contaminants off-site prior to detection and\nremediation. (c) Construction\nrequirements. The subgrade must be sufficiently dry to allow for construction\nactivities and structurally sound to ensure that the first lift and all\nsucceeding lifts of soil placed over it can be adequately compacted to the\ndesign requirements and to ensure stability of the landfill. (d) Certification requirements. Before any\nmaterial is placed over the landfill subgrade: (1)\nthe project engineer must inspect the\nexposed surface to evaluate the suitability of the subgrade to ensure that the\nsurface is properly compacted, smooth, and uniform and that elevations are\nconsistent with the department-approved drawings; and\n(2)\nthe subgrade must be tested for density\nand moisture content at a minimum frequency of nine tests per acre.
