  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 664.3 - Purposes and Approach\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Public\npolicy. It is the public policy of the State, as set forth in the Freshwater\n\nWetlands Act, to preserve, protect and conserve freshwater wetlands and the\nbenefits derived therefrom, to prevent the despoliation and destruction of\nwetlands, and to regulate use and development of wetlands to secure the natural\nbenefits of those wetlands, consistent with the general welfare and beneficial\neconomic, social, and agricultural development of the State. It is the purpose\nof this Part to implement that policy by clarifying certain aspects of wetland\nidentification and delineation of jurisdiction, and by creating a system for\nclassifying wetlands in accordance with section 24-0903(1) of the Act. In\naccordance with the public policy of the State, such a system must account for\nthe many benefits described below and in section 24-0105(7) of the\n\nAct. (b) Wetland benefits. The\npreservation, protection, and conservation of wetlands is of public concern\nbecause of the functions and benefits they provide. These include: (1)\n\nFlood and stormwater control. Wetlands\nslow water runoff and temporarily store water, thus helping to protect\ndownstream areas from flooding, particularly storm related flooding due to\nclimate change. Public health and private property may be harmed in one portion\nof a watershed if wetlands are destroyed in a different part of that\nwatershed. (2)\n\nWildlife habitat. Wetlands are of unparalleled value as wildlife habitat, and the perpetuation of\nscores of species which depend upon them. Many of the species are migratory and\nmust have nesting, migration, and wintering habitat. The destruction of one\nkind of wetland habitat in one place may reduce populations of wildlife\nelsewhere. Where specific wetlands support endangered species, destruction of\nthose wetlands may threaten the persistence of that species in the entire\n\nState. (3)\n\nWater supply. Wetlands\nthemselves are a source of surface water and may, under appropriate\nhydrological conditions, serve to recharge groundwater and aquifers and to\nmaintain surface water flow. (4)\n\nWater quality. Many wetlands serve as chemical and biological oxidation basins\nthat help cleanse water that flows through them. Wetlands can also serve as\nsedimentation areas, and filtering basins that absorb silt and organic matter, thereby protecting channels and harbors and enhancing water quality. (5)\n\nFisheries. Wetlands provide the spawning\nand nursery grounds for several species of fish. The availability of these fish\nin lakes and streams may be adversely affected by the loss of wetlands\ncontiguous to those waters. (6)\n\nFood chains. Food and organic detritus supplied by wetlands support the fish\nand wildlife within contiguous waters. (7)\n\nRecreation. Wetlands provide important\nhunting, fishing, boating, hiking, birdwatching, photography, camping, and\nother recreational opportunities. In addition, wetlands may be critical to\nrecreation beyond their own borders because of their ability to protect water\nquality and protect and produce wildlife and fish. (8)\n\nOpen space and aesthetic appreciation. Wetlands provide visual variety in many different settings. Especially in urban\nareas, wetland open space contributes to social well-being by providing relief\nfrom intense development and a sense of connection with the natural\nworld. (9)\n\nEducation and scientific\nresearch. Because of the high biological productivity and the variety of plant\nand animal species they can support, wetlands can be of broad social benefit in\nproviding outdoor laboratories and living classrooms for studying and\nappreciating natural history, ecology, and biology. Many of the lessons learned\nand principles evolved through study of wetlands are applicable to other\nenvironmental issues. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n664.3\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 31, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 53, eff. 1/1/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) Public policy. It is the public policy of the\n\nState, as set forth in the\n\nFreshwater Wetlands\n\nAct, to preserve, protect and conserve\nfreshwater wetlands\nand the benefits derived therefrom, to prevent the despoliation and destruction of\nwetlands, and to regulate use and development of\nwetlands\nto secure the natural benefits of those\nwetlands, consistent with the general welfare and beneficial economic, social and agricultural development of the\n\nState. It is the purpose of this Part to implement that policy by clarifying certain aspects of\nwetland\nmapping and delineation of jurisdiction, and by creating a system for classifying\nwetlands\nin accordance with section 24-0903(1) of the\nact. Such a system must take into account the present condition of\nwetlands\nas well as their many benefits described below and in section 24-0105(7) of the\nact. (b) Wetland\nbenefits. The preservation, protection and conservation of\nwetlands\nis of public concern because of the benefits they provide. These include: (1)\n\nFlood and stormwater control. Wetlands\nmay slow water runoff and temporarily store water, thus helping to protect downstream areas from flooding. Public health and private property in one part of a watershed may be harmed if\nwetlands\nare destroyed in a different part of that watershed. (2)\n\nWildlife habitat. Wetlands\nare of unparalleled value as wildlife habitat, and the perpetuation of scores of species depends upon them. Many of the species are migratory and must have nesting, migration, and wintering habitat. The destruction of one kind of\nwetland\nhabitat in one place may reduce populations of wildlife elsewhere. Where specific\nwetlands\nsupport endangered species, destruction of those\nwetlands\nmay threaten the presence of the endangered species for all time. (3)\n\nWater supply. Wetlands\nthemselves are a source of surface water and may, under appropriate hydrological conditions, serve to recharge groundwater and aquifers and to maintain surface water flow. (4)\n\nWater quality. Many\nwetlands\nserve as chemical and biological oxidation basins that help cleanse water that flows through them. Wetlands\ncan also serve as sedimentation areas and filtering basins that absorb silt and organic matter, thereby protecting channels and harbors and enhancing water quality. (5)\n\nFisheries. Wetlands\nprovide the spawning and nursery grounds for several species of fish. The availability of these fish in lakes and streams may be adversely affected by the loss of\nwetlands\nadjacent to those\nwaters. (6)\n\nFood chains. Food and organic detritus supplied by\nwetlands\nsupport the fish and wildlife of adjacent\nwaters. (7)\n\nRecreation. Wetlands\nprovide important hunting, fishing, boating, hiking, birdwatching, photography, camping, and other recreational opportunities. In addition, wetlands\nmay be critical to recreation beyond their own borders because of their ability to protect water quality and protect and produce wildlife and fish. (8)\n\nOpen space and aesthetic appreciation. Wetlands\nprovide visual variety in many different settings. Especially in urban areas, wetland\nopen space contributes to social well-being by providing relief from intense development and a sense of connection with the natural world. (9)\n\nEducation and scientific research. Because of the high biological productivity and the variety of plant and animal species they can support, wetlands\ncan be of broad social benefit in providing outdoor laboratories and living classrooms for studying and appreciating natural history, ecology and biology. Many of the lessons learned and principles evolved through study of\nwetlands\nare applicable to other eviron-mental issues. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n664.3",
