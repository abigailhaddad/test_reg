(1)\n\nCompleted program\napplications for rebates will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis. A program application shall be considered complete only when all of the\ninformation required under subdivision (b) of this section has been submitted\nto the Energy Office. (b) Application contents. Each program rebate\napplication submitted to the Energy Office shall contain the following\nmaterials: (1)\na completed application\nform; (2)\na signed certification\nthat the application satisfies the eligibility requirements for the program as\nstated in section\n7920.3\nof this Part; (3)\nwhere required, a focused energy analysis\nconsistent with the requirements of section\n7920.8\nof this Part; (4)\ndocumentation of total estimated project\ncost, including: (i) two contractors'\nestimates which detail the cost estimates for each energy conservation measure\nto be implemented. Cost estimates and schedules must reflect the total\ninstalled cost of each measure, including materials, labor, and construction\nmanagement and design fees; or\n(ii)\ntwo suppliers' estimates for supplying the materials for those projects to be\ninstalled with in-house or uncompensated labor; (iii)\nthe applicant must designate the\ncontractor(s) and supplier(s) selected. If the contractor(s) and supplier(s)\noffering the lowest estimates are not selected, the Energy Office may request\nadequate justification for the selection; (iv)\nif in-kind services are included in the\ntotal cost of installing a proposed project, a description of such services\nshall be provided as follows: (a) for labor, the total value of labor, including the applicable wage rates and projected\nhours to be worked on the proposed project; and\n(b) for materials to be installed or\nequipment to be used on the job site, a list of such materials or equipment, their proposed use, and the value assigned; and\n(v) the Energy Office, in its discretion, may\nwaive the requirements in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph that the\napplicant submit two contractors' and/or suppliers' estimates where the\napplicant demonstrates good cause for such waiver and the reasonableness of the\nproposed cost. As used herein, good cause means an unanticipated circumstance\nor event which, despite the due diligence of the applicant, renders compliance\nwith program requirements impracticable; (5)\nwhere required, energy savings\ncalculations. All calculations must be based on generally accepted engineering\nstandards; (6)\nauthorization from\nthe building owner to undertake the energy conservation measures, where the\nprogram application is being submitted by someone other than the building\nowner; (7)\nwhere two or more\napplicants occupying the same building seek to implement any energy\nconservation measure which would be mutually beneficial ( e.g., boiler\nreplacement or HVAC improvements that would affect more than one applicant in a\nbuilding), such applicants may submit a single program application. Such\napplication shall include a designation of one of the applicants as the project\nmanager; (8)\ncertification that any\nrequired approvals from organizations having oversight authority for the\napplicant's activities have been obtained; and\n(9)\nsuch additional information as may be\nrequired by the Energy Office.
