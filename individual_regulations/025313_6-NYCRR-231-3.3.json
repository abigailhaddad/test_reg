  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-3.3 - Exemptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any applicant\nfor a proposed new or modified facility which is subject to this Part may\npetition the department and the administrator of the United States\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, in accordance with\n42 U.S.C. section\n7511a(f), for a\ndetermination that net air quality benefits are greater in the absence of\nreductions of oxides of nitrogen from the facility. In addition, this Part\nshall not apply to facilities in nonattainment areas within the ozone transport\nregion if the administrator determines, in accordance with section 7511a(f), that reductions of NO\nx\nwould not produce net ozone air\nquality benefits, or facilities in nonattainment areas outside the ozone\ntransport region if the administrator determines, in accordance with section\n7511a(f), that reductions of NO\nx\nwould not contribute\nto attainment of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone in the\narea. To the extent that such a petition is granted by both the department and\nthe administrator, consistent with the act, the requirements of this Part for\nthe proposed new or modified facility with respect to emissions of NO\nx\nshall not apply. (b) The facility is exempt from this Part if\nit is major based only on the addition of fugitive emissions and does not\nbelong to one of the source categories listed in section\n201-2.1\n(b)(21)(iii)\nof this Title. (c) The provisions of\n\nSubparts 231-7 and 231-8 of this Part do not apply to a new or modified\nfacility as follows: (1)\nthe facility or\nemission source is portable and has previously received a permit under\nrequirements equivalent to those contained in this Part, if: (i) the facility or emission source proposes\nto relocate and emissions of the facility or emission source at the new\nlocation would be for less than one year; (ii)\nthe emissions from the facility would\nnot exceed its emission limit(s) established in a permit; (iii)\nthe emissions from the facility would\nimpact no Federal class I area and no area where an applicable increment is\nknown to be violated; and\n(iv)\nreasonable notice is given to the department prior to the relocation\nidentifying the proposed new location and the probable duration of operation at\nthe new location. Such notice must be given to the department not less than 10\ndays in advance of the proposed relocation unless a different time duration is\npreviously approved by the department; or\n(2)\nwith respect to a particular regulated\nNSR contaminant, the facility is located in an area designated as nonattainment\nunder section 107 of the act for that contaminant. (d) For the purposes of Subparts 231-7 and\n231-8 of this Part, if the emissions from a facility or modification would\noccur for less than one year and impact no Federal class I area, no area where\nan applicable increment is known to be violated, and would not contribute to\nknown standards violations, then the requirements of Subparts 231-7 and 231-8\nof this Part regarding source impact analysis and additional impact analyses, and section\n231-12.3\n(pre-application analysis\nfor Subparts 231-7 and 231-8) of this Part, do not apply to a facility with\nrespect to a particular regulated NSR contaminant. (e) If an existing major facility owner or\noperator submits a Part 201 application that includes a proposed modification\nand a request for enforceable permit terms and conditions to restrict or cap\nfacility wide emissions, in accordance with Subpart 201-7 of this Title, below\napplicable major facility thresholds, the modification is not subject to the\nrequirements of this Part. The Part 201 State facility permit issued by the\ndepartment must include all applicable requirements, including any control\ntechnology requirements and emission limitations that were in the title V\npermit. (f) Any emission source\nwhich is to be operated for less than one year, is determined not to be a\nsignificant action in accordance with the procedures contained in Part 617 of\nthis Title, and which has a project emission potential less than the applicable\nsignificant project threshold in table 3, table 4 or table 6 of Subpart 231-13\nof this Part, is not subject to this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-3.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
