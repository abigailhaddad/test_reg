  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 399.6 - Administrative food stamp fraud hearings (pre-August 1, 1983, acts)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Administrative\nfood stamp fraud hearings are defined in section\n399.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart and are separate and distinct from administrative disqualification\nhearings which are defined in section\n399.1\n(d). (b) Such hearings are scheduled by the\ndepartment at the request of the local social services district with the\ndepartment providing at least 30 days' advance notice of the hearing to the\nrecipient or former recipient against whom the hearing is requested. The\ndistrict shall request the hearing by forwarding to the department an\nevidentiary packet which conforms to the standards as set forth in section\n399.3\n(i) of this\n\nPart, along with its request for a hearing. (c) Upon receipt of a local social services\ndistrict's request for hearing and accompanying evidentiary packet, the\ndepartment will review the packet to determine if it contains sufficient\ndocumentary evidence to substantiate that an individual has committed one or\nmore acts of fraud as defined in section\n399.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. The department will make a further and concurrent determination as to\nwhether the evidentiary packet satisfies the provisions of section\n399.3\n(i) of this\n\nPart. Should the department's review of the evidentiary packet indicate that\nthere is either insufficient documentary evidence to establish fraud as\ncommitted or that the packet does not comply with the provisions of section\n399.3\n(i), the\ndepartment will return the packet to the local social services district as\ninsufficient for scheduling. (d) Following a determination that the evidentiary packet is sufficient, the\ndepartment shall schedule an administrative food stamp fraud hearing in\naccordance with subdivision (b) of this section. The notice of hearing shall be\nmailed certified mail, return receipt requested, to the recipient charged and\nshall contain a warning that a determination of fraud will result in a\nthree-month disqualification for the individual and a reduction in benefits for\nthe remainder of the household and: (1)\nthe\ndate, time, and place of the hearing; (2)\nthe charge(s) against the household\nmember; (3)\na summary of the\nevidence and how and where the evidence may be examined; (4)\na warning that the decision will be based\nsolely on information provided by the local social services district if the\nhousehold member fails to appear at the hearing; (5)\na notification that the household or its\nrepresentative may have an opportunity to examine all documents and records to\nbe used at the hearing by calling a specific contact telephone number and\nmaking arrangements to examine the documents and records at a specified place, provided that confidential information, such as names of individuals who have\ndisclosed information about the household without its knowledge or the nature\nor status of pending criminal prosecutions, is protected from\nrelease; (6)\nnotification of the\nhousehold's right to request an adjournment (indicating that such a request\nshould be made at least 10 days in advance of the scheduled hearing date), to\npresent the case or be represented by legal counsel or other person, to bring\nwitnesses, to advance arguments without undue interference, to question or\nrefute any testimony or evidence, to confront and cross-examine adverse\nwitnesses and to submit evidence to establish all pertinent facts in the\ncase; (7)\nnotification to the\nhousehold and to the individual charged of the right to remain silent both\nbefore and at the hearing; (8)\na\nstatement that a copy of this Part is available to the household at the local\nsocial services district; (9)\ncopies of the pages of this Part relevant to the hearing process; (10)\na citation of the Federal or State food\nstamp regulation governing the action where appropriate; (11)\na listing of legal aid and/or legal\nservices organizations in all portions of the State which are available to\nassist with defense of the case; (12)\na statement that the hearing does not\npreclude the State or Federal government from prosecuting the household member\nfor fraud in a civil or criminal court action, or from collecting the\noverissuance; and\n(13)\na statement\nthat the household member or representative will have 10 days from the date of\nthe scheduled hearing to present good cause for failure to appear to the\ndepartment in order to receive a new hearing. The notice of hearing sent to recipients in New York City\nshall be in Spanish and English. (e) The department shall mail the local\nsocial services district which requested the hearing notification of the time, date and place of the hearing by regular mail at the same time it mails notice\nof the hearing to the household member. (f) The department shall base a determination\nof fraud on a showing by the local social services district by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the household member knowingly, willingly and with\ndeceitful intent committed fraud as defined in section\n399.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. The burden of proof shall be on the local district. (g) If the department issues a decision\nconfirming the local social services district's determination of fraud, no\nfurther administrative appeal exists. The household member is entitled to seek\nrelief in a court having appropriate jurisdiction. The period of\ndisqualification may be subject to stay or other injunctive remedy by such a\ncourt. (h) If the department's\ndecision confirms the local social services district's determination of fraud, the local social services district shall mail the household member found to\nhave committed fraud a written notice accompanied by a demand letter prior to\ndisqualification which shall: (1)\n\nInform the\nhousehold member of the decision and the reason for the decision and the length\nof the period of disqualification. (2)\n\nAdvise the remaining members of the\nhousehold, if any, of either the allotment they will receive during the period\nof disqualification, or that they must reapply because the certification period\nhas expired. (3)\n\nAdvise the\nhousehold member of the date upon which the disqualification will take effect\nand the date upon which it will end. If the individual is no longer\nparticipating, advise that the period of disqualification shall be deferred\nuntil such time as the individual applies for and is determined eligible for\nbenefits. (4)\n\nEnclose a written\nnotice of food stamp overissuance and repayment agreement, specified by the\ndepartment, which must indicate to the household: (i) the amount owed; (ii)\nthe reason for the claim; (iii)\nthe period of time the claim\ncovers; (iv)\nany offsetting that\nwas done to reduce the claim; (v) how the household may pay the claim; (vi)\nthe length of time the household has to\ndecide which method of repayment it will choose and inform the local social\nservices district of its decision; (vii)\nthe fact that the household's allotment\nwill be reduced if the household fails to agree to make restitution within the\ntime period specified; (viii)\nthe\nhousehold's right to request renegotiation of any repayment schedule to which\nit has agreed should the household's economic circumstances change; (ix)\na method of electing the repayment\nmethod by which the household wishes to liquidate the claim; (x) the place for signature for the household\nmember who committed the intentional program violation and that the head of\nhousehold must also sign the demand letter if the individual found to have\ncommitted the intentional program violation is not the head of\nhousehold; (xi)\nthat if the\nparticipating household fails to sign and return the repayment agreement within\n30 days from the mailing date of such agreement that the social services\ndistrict will collect the over-issuance by allotment reduction. (5)\n\nInform the individual to be\ndisqualified and the remainder of the household of its right to a fair hearing\nto contest: (i) the amount of the\nclaim; (ii)\nthe benefits to be\nprovided the remaining members of the household during the disqualification\nperiod; or\n(iii)\nthe social\nservices district's failure to restore the disqualified individual to the\nhousehold when the household requested the restoration after the end of the\ndisqualification period indicated in the written notice. (i) The department shall schedule\nhearings requested under the provisions of paragraph (h)(5) of this section in\nthe same manner as any other fair hearing. (j) A pending administrative food stamp fraud\nhearing shall not affect the individual or the household's right to be\ncertified and participate in the Food Stamp Program. (k) The local social services district shall\noffset any lost benefits to be restored to the household against the\noutstanding amount of the claim from the time it receives the department's\ndecision until the claim is liquidated. The district shall send the household a\nwritten indication of each such offset transaction which shall indicate the\nclaim balance before offset, the amount of lost benefits offset and the\nremaining claim balance. (l) The\ntime and place of the hearing shall be arranged so that the hearing is\naccessible to the household member. If the household member or its\nrepresentative cannot be located or fails to appear at the hearing initiated by\nthe State agency, the hearing shall be conducted without the household member\nbeing present. Even though the household member is not present, the hearing\nofficial is required to carefully consider the evidence and determine if fraud\nwas committed based on clear and convincing evidence. If the household member\nis found to have committed fraud, but a hearing official later determines that\nthe household member or representative had good cause for not appearing, the\nprevious decision shall no longer remain valid and the State agency shall\nconduct a new hearing. The hearing official who originally rules on the case\nmay conduct the hearing. The household member has 10 days from the date of the\nscheduled hearing to present reasons indicating a good cause for failure to\nappear. A hearing officer must enter the good cause decision into the\nrecord. (m) Conducting the hearing. (1)\n\nThe hearing officer shall advise the\nhousehold member of representative that they may refuse to answer questions\nduring the hearing. (2)\n\nThe burden\nof proof shall be on the local social services district. (3)\n\nAll provisions of the department's\nregulations regarding the conduct of fair hearings in the Food Stamp Program\nwhich are not inconsistent with any of the specific provisions of this section\nshall be applicable to these hearings. (n) The administrative food stamp fraud\nhearing decision. The decision after hearing shall be based upon clear and\nconvincing evidence which demonstrates that the household member(s) knowingly, willingly and with deceitful intent committed fraud. (1)\n\nThe decision of the department shall\nspecify the reasons for the decision, identify the supporting evidence, identify the pertinent Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) regulation, and respond\nto reasoned arguments made by the household member or representative. (2)\n\nThe department shall conduct the hearing, arrive at a decision and forward the decision to the local district for\nimplementing action within 90 days (unless there is a client-requested\nadjournment) of the date of the initial notice from the department that the\nhearing has been scheduled.
