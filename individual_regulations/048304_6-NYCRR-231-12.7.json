  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-12.7 - Significant impact levels for facilities located in attainment areas\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purposes of an impact analysis in support of\nprovisions of Subparts 231-7 and 231-8 of this Part, the significant impact\nlevels defined in section\n231-12.6\nof this Subpart will serve\nto determine whether a new or modified source will have a significant air\nquality impact or a contribution to potential standards violation or PSD\nincrement exceedances in both the attainment area of the proposed project and\nin any adjacent nonattainment areas. The levels in section\n231-12.6\nof this Subpart apply in\nall attainment areas in the State for the specific NSR contaminant and serve as\nthe required modeling demonstration to show insignificant impacts for that\ncontaminant. A showing that the maximum impacts from the proposed new or\nmodified facility for any regulated NSR contaminant are below the lesser of\nthese significant impact levels or the difference between the NAAQS and the\nbackground concentration for that regulated NSR contaminant will be deemed\nadequate as the required impact analysis to demonstrate that the source will\nnot contribute to a standards violation or PSD increment exceedance for that\nregulated NSR contaminant. However, such a demonstration will not exclude the\nperformance of any other required impact analysis to satisfy other applicable\nprovisions of Subparts 231-5 to 231-8 of this Part, including the modeling for\nair quality related values in Federal class I areas.
