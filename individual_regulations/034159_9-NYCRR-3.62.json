  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.62 - Executive order no. 62: [establishing an executive advisory committee on sentencing.]\nState Regulations\n\nThe most effective and desirable utilization of the\nconcepts of imprisonment, probation and parole, as means of achieving the\nobjectives of the criminal justice system, is the subject of widespread\ncontroversy today. Criminal sanctions must be designed to insure public safety\nand deter others who would commit similar offenses. They must also, insofar as\npossible, seek the rehabilitation of those offenders who will benefit from help\nin reconstructing their lives. They must be fair--fair to the accused, fair to\nthe victims of crime and fair to the public at large. How these objectives can best be achieved by the proper use\nof imprisonment, probation and parole may be the most important question in\npenology today. At the center of the controversy is the question whether\nindeterminate sentences, such as those provided for under the New York Penal\n\nLaw, are preferable to a system of definite sentencing, or whether some option\nbetween the two approaches should lie with the sentencing judge. Several states\nhave recently moved in the direction of substituting definite sentences for\npre-existing systems based on the indeterminate approach. Whether our existing sentencing laws are best suited to\nachieve the goals of our criminal justice system, or should be modified or even\ndrastically changed, is a difficult and complex question requiring wise and\ncareful professional study. Such a study must assess the effect of any proposed\nchange on all components of the criminal justice system, including the police, corrections, the courts and all other stages of the criminal justice process, as well as on the public at large. Now, therefore, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby establish an executive advisory\ncommittee, to be known as the Executive Advisory Committee on\n\nSentencing. I. Powers and\nresponsibilities: The Executive Advisory Committee on Sentencing\nshall: Evaluate the effectiveness of the existing laws relating to\nimprisonment, probation and parole in achieving appropriate sentencing goals, including protection of the public, rehabilitation of offenders and fairness to\nthe offender, the victim and the public at large. Study and evaluate proposals to improve the effectiveness\nof laws relating to imprisonment, probation and parole, and analyze the impact\nof such proposals on the various elements of the criminal justice system and on\nthe public at large. Submit to the Governor such interim reports as the chairman\ndeems appropriate and a final report setting forth the committee's\nrecommendations for legislative and administrative changes, if any, to increase\nthe effectiveness of the State's sentencing laws. The committee's final report\nshall outline the work of the committee and include any statistical and factual\ndata gathered by the committee. Review and evaluate proposed criminal justice legislation\nwhich may be submitted to the committee by the Governor. II. Membership: The members of the Executive Advisory Committee on\n\nSentencing shall be appointed by the Governor, who shall designate the\nchairman. The members of the committee shall receive no compensation but shall\nbe entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred in connection\nwith the performance of their duties. III. Personnel: The chairman may employ such staff and assistants as he may\ndeem necessary at a compensation to be fixed by him within the amount of the\nappropriation therefor and subject to the approval of the Division of the\n\nBudget. Wherever possible, the committee shall make use of existing staff and\nresources in the various State agencies, which are hereby directed to render\nfull cooperation and assistance to the committee.
