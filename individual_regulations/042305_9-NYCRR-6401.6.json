  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6401.6 - Council action on appeals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Appeals panel recommends that appeal\nbrought on the basis of section\n6401.2\n(a)(1) or\n(2)\nor\n6401.2\n(a)(3)(ii)\nof this Part has merit. Should the appeals panel recommend that the appeal\nbrought on the basis of section\n6401.2\n(a)(1) or\n(2)\nor\n6401.2\n(a)(3)(ii)\nof this Part has merit, the application will be reviewed de novo as soon as\npracticable by the staff, panel, committee and council, but if the\nrecommendation is received after the disbursement of all council funds, the\napplication shall be reviewed at the first funding meeting of the next year, under the guidelines of the previous year. A council decision on a program\nrequest that has been reviewed under this subdivision is final. (b) Appeals panel recommends that an appeal\nbrought on the basis of section\n6401.2\n(a)(3)(i)\nof\nthis Part has merit. Should the appeals panel recommend that an appeal brought\non the basis of section\n6401.2\n(a)(3)(i)\nhas merit, the application will be reviewed as soon as practicable by the staff\nwho will then forward the appeal directly to the appropriate committee which\nwill then send it to the council, but if the recommendation is received after\nthe disbursement of all council funds, the application shall be reviewed at the\nfirst funding meeting of the next year, under the guidelines of the previous\nyear. A council decision on a program request that has been reviewed under this\nsubdivision is final. (c) Appeals\npanel recommends that appeal has no merit. A recommendation by the appeals\npanel that an appeal has no merit shall be presented to the council for action\nat the next regularly scheduled council meeting, or as soon thereafter as is\npracticable. Concurrence by the council in the recommendation of the appeals\npanel terminates the appeal process for that particular program request. A\ndecision of the council, which reverses the recommendation of the appeals panel\nand finds that the appeal has merit, will result either in the remand of the\napplication for de novo review by staff, panel, committee and council in the\nsame manner as provided in subdivision (a) of this section, or, if the council\nso selects, in a de novo review and decision on funding by the council, without\nremand to staff, panel or committee.
