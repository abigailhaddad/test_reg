Pursuant to\n\nRule 207.7(c) all proofs of service of process, notices of motion, and orders\nto show cause, must be filed two days prior to the return date. 2. Counsel shall check with\nthe clerk of the court as to the appropriate date to be entered for return of\nnotice of motion prior to serving and filing. 3. Where, by court order, service of\nprocess is permitted by certified or registered mail it is not necessary to\nfile a signed return receipt unless directed by the court. The affidavit of\nservice, however, must include a statement that the mailing was not returned to\nthe sender as undeliverable. Pleadings and Papers Filed With\n\nCourt\n4. Any\npleading or paper supplemental thereto (waiver and consent, renunciation, affidavit, etc.) which is dated more than six months prior to date of filing is\nconsidered stale and not accepted for filing by the court. 5. Where it appears that a\npleading must be amended, amendment may be accomplished by the affidavit of the\npetitioner or petitioner's attorney unless directed otherwise by the clerk of\nthe court. 6. No\nparty in interest in a proceeding can act as a notary public for any papers\nfiled in the proceeding. Status of the Parties; Proof of\n\nKinship\n7.
