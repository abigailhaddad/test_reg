  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1901.2 - Procedures for the operation of short-term temporary release\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis following section describes the procedures necessary\nfor the successful operation of the short-term temporary release\nprograms. (a) Before release. (1)\n\nNotification to inmates. Inmates shall be\nnotified of the final decision as soon as it is known so that the inmate may\nmake any further arrangements necessary to successfully complete a temporary\nrelease program. (2)\n\nParole field\ninvestigations. Field investigations shall be requested for those cases where\nthe temporary release committee feels there is insufficient information\nregarding the requested residence or whenever there is some question relative\nto that residence, the individuals with whom the inmate may be staying, or any\naspect of the case and its community impact. This will be done as soon as the\ninmate is finally approved for furloughs or leaves of absence. If the field\ninvestigation is negative, the inmate should be notified of the results\nhonestly and diplomatically in consultation with counseling and parole staff\nwhere necessary. (3)\n\nIn those cases\nwhere there is no specific question raised by the temporary release committee\nrelative to residence or community feelings, and the temporary release\ncommittee approves the case for furlough, a residence questionnaire, form\n4118-A, will be sent to the requested residence if the residence is an occupied\npremises. That affidavit must be notarized and returned to the facility before\nthe inmate is released. In any other case involving an otherwise legal and\nverifiable approved residence but the temporary release committee feels there\nis insufficient information regarding the residence, the procedure established\nin paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall be followed. (4)\n\nCentral monitoring case designations. Any\nnonstatutory case which has been designated a central monitoring case by the\ninspector general's office is a central office review case. All other\nnonstatutory cases must be screened by the inspector general's office prior to\nrelease to determine whether or not a central monitoring case designation is\nappropriate. A list of temporary release committee approved nonstatutory cases\nshould be forwarded to the inspector general's office in Albany within three\nworking days after each temporary release committee meets, on form 1171. Any\ncases which are returned designated central monitoring cases must be submitted\nto central office for review and will require final approval of the deputy\ncommissioner for security. Those cases that are not designated central\nmonitoring cases may be processed for release. (5)\n\nNotification to local law enforcement\noffices. (i) At least five working days\nbefore releasing an inmate on a temporary release program, the superintendent\nshall notify, in writing, the sheriff or chief of police of the community into\nwhich the inmate is to be released. (ii)\n\nHenceforth, form 4186 (TRP-8) shall be\nmailed to the appropriate law enforcement official at least five working days\nprior to the release of any inmate on any type of temporary release except in\ncases of emergency leaves of absence where telephone contact shall be made and\nthe form 4186 (TRP-8) shall be mailed as soon as practical. In the cases of\nfurloughs, community services leaves and leaves of absence where the inmate is\nnot under supervision by a parole officer or is leaving the supervision area of\nhis assigned parole officer, a form 4186 (TRP-8) shall then be forwarded to the\nappropriate parole area office to alert them of the impending release of an\ninmate subject to supervision. (iii)\nA copy of the form 4186 (TRP-8) shall\nbe filed in the inmate's institutional file. (iv)\nA copy of the form 4186 (TRP-8) will\nalso be sent to the area parole office administering the area in which the\ninmate is being released. This is to alert that office to expect the inmate to\nmake phone contact. The notification shall include: (a) The name and relationship of the person\nwith whom the inmate plans to reside while on temporary release. (b) The full address, including apartment\nnumber. (c) The telephone number at\nthat address, if available. (d) In\nthe case of medical leaves of absence, the name, address and telephone number\nof the inmate's hospital and physician. (6)\n\nShort-term temporary release financial\nprocedures. (i) Only in exceptional\ncircumstances will an inmate be allowed to take with him or have access to more\nthan $100 above his transportation costs. (ii)\n\nAny short-term temporary release program\nmay be postponed until the inmate can finance transportation. Inmates leaving\nthe facility on a short-term temporary release program will assume all expenses\nin connection with the trip. If sufficient funds are not available in the\ninmate's account, an advance to cover transportation and minimal personal\nexpenses may be granted but only in exceptional cases. Travel request form\nAC28H should be used by facility personnel where possible to purchase tickets\nfor the inmate. Those costs must be reimbursed by the inmate. (iii)\n\nThe temporary release committee\nchairperson will tell the inmate the department's policy concerning\nreimbursement according to section\n1900.4\nof this Title. The inmate's repayment schedule should include reimbursement for\ntransportation, lodging and personal expenses if required. (7)\n\nProcessing procedures. All inmates will\nleave and return to the facility through the processing room. General\nconfinement facilities may modify these procedures to meet their unique needs. Each temporary release committee chairperson shall assure that their processing\nprocedures are filed with the director of temporary release programs. (i) Each temporary release approved inmate\nshall be photographed for a temporary release identification card. The\nidentification card must be in the possession of the inmate when he leaves the\nfacility, at all times during his release, and must be surrendered and\ndestroyed upon his return to the facility. (ii)\n\nThe processing officer will arrange for\nthe inmate's clothing, making sure to record what clothing is being worn from\nthe facility. The inmate will not be allowed to return with any article other\nthan what was taken out with him. (iii)\n\nThe temporary release committee\nchairperson will assure that the memorandum of agreement, rules and regulations\n(see Part 1902 of this Title), and other required forms are explained to the\ninmate and properly signed prior to the inmate going to the processing-out\narea. In the event an inmate cannot speak English, a notation will be made on\nthe memo of agreement that it was explained to the inmate in a language which\nhe/she understands and the notation will be signed by the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson. The temporary release committee chairperson will assure\nthat the processing officer will double-check all papers and be sure that there\nis proper authorization to leave the facility and that no restriction order\nexists. The memorandum of agreement will be in the inmate's possession when he\nleaves the institution and surrendered upon his return. (iv)\n\nThe processing officer will then see\nthat the inmate receives his approved funds and arranges for his departure from\nthe facility. (b) Release and return. (1)\n\nRelease of the inmate. Inmates approved\nfor participation in temporary release programs in accordance with these\nregulations may be permitted to go outside the premises of the institution\nwithin the limits of the extended bounds of confinement described in the\nmemorandum of agreement which must be signed by the inmates. The canary copy\nshall be sent to central office. Section\n856 (1)\nof the Correction\n\nLaw requires every inmate leaving the premises of an institution to participate\nin a temporary release program to have on his or her person an identification\ncard and to exhibit such card to any peace officer upon request. The temporary\nrelease committee chairperson shall arrange for all inmates to be issued an\nidentification card as they are processed out of the facility. The memorandum\nof agreement will be in the inmate's possession when he leaves the institution\nand surrendered upon his return. (2)\n\nSupervision of furlough, leave of absence\nand short-term community services leave. (i) Section\n852 (5)\nof the Correction\n\nLaw requires that all inmates participating in temporary release programs be\nsupervised by parole officers. (ii)\n\nInmates who are already under the supervision of a parole officer in a work\nrelease, educational release, long-term community services leave, or other\ncontinuous temporary release programs are deemed to be also under the\ncontinuous supervision of this same parole officer for furlough supervision\npurposes and are not subject to the furlough supervision guidelines described\nin this paragraph. Instead, these inmates are the subject to a special\nsupervision category described in Part 1903 of this Title. (iii)\n\nInmates who are not in any type of\ncontinuous temporary release program and are not already under the supervision\nof a parole officer shall be subject to the furlough supervision guidelines\ndescribed in this paragraph. (iv)\n\nEach inmate shall be explicitly instructed by the temporary release committee\nchairperson or his designee of his or her reporting obligations prior to\nleaving the facility. (v) Failure\nto comply with these requirements shall subject an inmate to disciplinary\npenalties and shall be seriously considered upon any subsequent temporary\nrelease application. (vi)\n\nThe\nfacility is to include on the inmate's release papers the address and telephone\nnumber of the area parole office which the inmate is to contact. (vii)\n\nThe inmate is to be informed that he or\nshe is to call the reception desk at that area office the first weekday he is\nat home and shall follow any directions given him by the area parole office\npersonnel. (viii)\n\nNo inmate may be\nreleased unless provision is made as stated in this paragraph, or in a\ncommensurate manner for the inmate to contact an area parole office. (ix)\n\nThe staff person at the reception desk\nin the area office will verify the inmate's arrival and residence. (x) Special arrangements or waiver of the\nrequirements of this paragraph may have to be made by the area office, if the\ninmate is living in a rural area or is in the area for a very short period of\ntime and is unable to get to either the area office or the nearest reporting\nstation. (xi)\n\nIn New York City, all\nreports and telephone calls are to be made to the Division of Parole, 314 West\n40th Street, and not to the Bronx substation. (xii)\n\nWithin one week of the termination of\nthe temporary release, the area office will submit a report to the facility\ndetailing its contacts with the inmate. (xiii)\n\nIn the event that an inmate on whom\nthe area office has received a form 4186 (TRP-8) fails to contact the area\noffice, or fails to keep his or her appointment for reporting to the area\noffice, the area office shall notify the facility of such failure as soon as\npracticable; when necessary, delinquency action will be taken. (xiv)\n\nIn the event the parole officer becomes\naware of an inmate's arrest or behavior which has caused concern in the\ncommunity, the parole office will advise the facility of the inmate's\ndelinquency through a memorandum outlining the facts of the case, with a copy\nsent to the director of temporary release programs as soon as\npossible. (xv)\n\nAny further reports\nwill be requested through the institutional parole office, which will issue a\nform IS-2 to the parole field office. (3)\n\nEvaluation on return. After the inmate's\nrelease and subsequent return to the facility, his participation in temporary\nrelease shall be evaluated. Late returns or returns under the influence of\ndrugs and alcohol and other program violations shall be noted on the inmate's\ntemporary release record and referred for disciplinary action where\nappropriate. In the event of a failure, form 4132 will be used, with copies\nappropriately distributed. (i) Lateness. The\nrules governing late returns to the facility are as follows: (a) An inmate is late if he or she has not\nreturned to the facility by the time he or she was due. (b) Inmates who are late: (1)\nlose 2 points pursuant to section\n1900.4\n(e)(2)(v)\nof this Title; and\n(2)\nshall be\nsubject to disciplinary action and penalties, including loss of privileges, keeplock and special housing, and the temporary release committee may take time\nfrom the next furlough at the rate of three hours for every hour or part of an\nhour they are late. (c) Inmates who are late with an excuse shall be subject to disciplinary action and\npenalties, including loss of privileges, keeplock and special housing, and the\ntemporary release committee may take time from the next furlough at the rate of\nthree hours for every hour or part of an hour they are late. (d) If an inmate does not return to the\nfacility by the time he is due because of delays in public transportation\nbeyond his control, he should not be considered late if the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson can verify the delay through the bus company, train\nstation or other transportation provider. (e) If an inmate is late for a reason other\nthan proven delays in public transportation, he will be considered late. If he\nis able to show that his reason for being late is a good one, he shall be\nconsidered late with an excuse. Any inmate who wishes to be considered late\nwith an excuse must be able to provide proof of the reason for his lateness. A\nnote of receipt for services from the filling station, tow truck or State\n\nPolice would be acceptable proof for documenting a breakdown. A note from a\ndoctor would be sufficient to show that return to the facility was delayed by\ntending to a sick child. The temporary release committee chairperson should\ndecide what kind of documentation is required in each case. (ii)\n\nDrug use and alcohol abuse. (a) If an inmate returns to the facility with\nevidence of drug use or alcohol use/abuse (see clause [e] of this subparagraph\nfor alcohol clarification), he will lose 2 points on the point system and be\nsubject to losing more points for disciplinary action. If he returns to the\nfacility both late and under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he will lose 4\npoints, with the possibility of losing more points for any disciplinary\naction. (b) During the review of a\ntemporary release application, careful attention must be given to the\npossibility that the inmate/applicant has had alcohol-related problems in the\npast. If the case file reveals that the inmate has ever experienced problems\nrelated to the use of alcohol, then the memorandum of agreement that the inmate\nsigns before leaving on any form of temporary release must be amended to\nindicate that he or she must completely abstain from the use of alcohol while\non temporary release. (c) For those\nwho have been directed to completely abstain, failure to abide by this rule\nwill mean that disciplinary action will be taken against the inmate and\nviolation of this rule could mean revocation of temporary release\nprivileges. (d) For inmates whose\ncase files do not indicate any alcohol-related problems, their memorandum of\nagreement must contain a prohibition against the abuse of alcohol while on\ntemporary release. (e) Abuse is\ndefined as the concentration of alcohol in the system of more than 0.10 as\ndetermined through the use of a breathalyzer, urinalysis or blood sample\nanalysis. (f) For those who have\nbeen directed to refrain from the abuse of alcohol, failure to abide by this\nrule will mean that disciplinary action will be taken against the inmate and\nviolation of this rule could mean revocation of temporary release\nprivileges. (g) Any facility\nemployee who observes that an inmate, who has recently returned from temporary\nrelease, appears to be under the influence of alcohol, or has the odor of\nliquor on his breath or clothes or is staggering or slurring his speech, must\nnotify the temporary release committee chairperson or watch commander so that\nappropriate testing can be accomplished which will verify the presence and\nindicate the level of alcohol in the inmate's system. (iii)\n\nOther program rule violations. (a) Any other program rule violations known\nto have existed or occurred during the course of the furlough or leave of\nabsence and the inmate's return to the facility must be reported on an inmate\nmisbehavior report to the superintendent. (b) The inmate misbehavior report must be\nwritten by the institutional employee who becomes aware of the violation. If a\nviolation is noted during processing in procedures, but not reported on a\nmisbehavior report, the temporary release committee chairperson will write the\nreport and submit it for disciplinary hearing review. The same will be true of\nany violation of the rules realized by the temporary release committee\nchairperson subsequent to completion of the furlough. (c) All violations of temporary release rules\nand regulations will be reported to the superintendent through the existing\ndisciplinary procedures as with all other disciplinary cases. Any documentation\nrelevant to the misbehavior should be reviewed by the disciplinary process to\nassist in a determination. (d) The\nhearing officer should adjudicate the case according to Chapter V of this\n\nTitle. The temporary release committee, however, has sole discretion to make\ntemporary release decisions. (iv)\n\nAbsconding. (a) Failure to return on time. (1)\n\nShould an inmate be unable to return to\nthe correctional facility where he is confined by the time that he is scheduled\nto return, the inmate must do one of the following: (i) contact the facility temporary release\ncommittee chairperson (at night or on weekends, the watch commander) in advance\nof the time that he is due to return, and try to arrange for an extension of\nhis return time; or\n(ii)\ncontact\nthe facility temporary release committee chairperson (at night or on weekends, the watch commander) to let the facility know that he is returning late for\nreasons beyond his control, and state the reason why. (2)\n\nThe temporary release committee\nchairperson, or someone designated by the superintendent, must make the\ndecision whether the inmate should be granted an extension of time on temporary\nrelease or is to be considered late. He should also make arrangements for the\nlate return of inmates who telephone the facility after the time that they are\ndue back. (3)\n\nAn inmate is to be\nconsidered a temporary release absconder if he fails to return to the\ncorrectional facility where he is confined by the time that he is scheduled to\nreturn as specified in the memo of agreement which he signed. If an inmate has\nnot returned to the correctional institution within five hours after the time\nthat he was due to return, or fails to follow the procedures set forth in this\nsubparagraph, the facility will assume the inmate does not intend to return, a\nwarrant for detention and return of temporary release inmate, form 4116\n(TRP-6), is to be issued, and the inmate is to be dropped from the official\nfacility count. (4)\n\nUnusual\nincident report will be made in accordance with existing departmental\npolicy. (5)\n\nSection\n856 (2)\nof the Correction\n\nLaw states that \"The failure of an inmate to voluntarily return to the\ninstitution of his confinement more than 10 hours after his prescribed time of\nreturn shall create a rebuttable presumption that the failure to return was\nintentional. Any inmate pursuant to this subdivision shall be an absconder in\nviolation of his temporary release program and will not be an eligible inmate\nas defined in this Chapter.\"\n(6)\n\nTherefore, in the event that any participant returns to a correctional facility\nmore than 10 hours late, the facility shall conduct a superintendent's hearing, during which the inmate will be given the opportunity to rebut the presumption\nthat his failure to return on time was intentional. However, in the absence of\nsuch a rebuttal, the inmate is to be found guilty of the disciplinary charge, and removed from all temporary release programs. Further, the inmate is to be\nconsidered ineligible to take part in any kind of temporary release program at\nany time in the future. (7)\n\nThe\ntemporary release committee chairperson shall see to it that a copy of such\nsuperintendent's hearing shall be made part of the inmate's case file at the\nfacility and at central office as well as the institution's Division of Parole\nfolder so that this information will be available to the Board of Parole at the\ninmate's next scheduled appearance before the board. (b) When a program participant\nabsconds--procedures to be followed. The following procedures shall be followed\nwhen any temporary release participant absconds from his temporary release\nprogram: (1)\nA warrant for detention and\nreturn of temporarily released inmate, form 4116 (TRP-6), signed by the\nfacility superintendent, acting superintendent, or an employee of the Inspector\n\nGeneral's office, shall be issued for the absconder's arrest. Each warrant\nissued shall be numbered consecutively, and the number shall be prefixed by the\nabbreviated letters which correspond to the facility name. Line two of the\nwarrant shall contain the inmate's full name and line three shall contain his\n\nNew York State IIS identification number. (2)\n\nThe employee who caused the\nsuperintendent or acting superintendent to authorize the issuing of a warrant\nshall immediately notify the Department of Correctional Services command\ncontrol center in central office that the inmate has absconded and that a\nwarrant has been issued in accordance with departmental policy. This same\nemployee shall also notify the facility's head correctional clerk and temporary\nrelease committee chairperson about the absconder. (3)\n\nThe employee who causes the warrant to be\nissued shall notify the local New York State Police and local police station\nhouses about the absconded inmate according to the facility's local\nprocedure. (4)\n\nThe chairperson of\nthe facility's temporary release committee shall, at his earliest opportunity, telephone the office of the director of temporary release programs in central\noffice and alert the director of temporary release programs that the inmate has\nabsconded. It will then be the responsibility of the director of temporary\nrelease programs to immediately contact the Department of Correctional\n\nServices' inspector general's office to alert them to the absconder. It will\nthen be the responsibility of the department's inspector general's office, in\ncoordination with the various New York State Police violent felony warrant\nsquads, to search for and apprehend the temporary release absconder. (5)\n\nThe chairperson of the facility's\ntemporary release committee will then have the responsibility, within one\nworking day of the inmate's absconding, to prepare and place in the mail five\ncopies of an absconder packet which shall contain each of the following items: (i) a certified copy of the warrant for the\nabsconder's arrest. The notary certification should be on the back of the\nwarrant itself, and should not be on a separate sheet of paper attached to the\nwarrant; (ii)\na completed copy of\nthe temporary release program absconder notification form 4190; (iii)\na set of the most recent photographs of\nthe absconder; (iv)\na set of very\nclear copies of the absconder's fingerprints; (v) a copy of the absconder's receiving\nblotter sheet. This must also comply with confidentiality requirements (see\nsubparagraph [vi] of this paragraph); (vi)\na copy of the absconder's\nsuperintendent's card showing disciplinary violations. All references on that\ncard to drug or alcohol use must be eliminated to comply with confidentiality\nrequirements; (vii)\na copy of the\nabsconder's correspondence sheet, a copy of the record of the absconder's\nvisitors received with their names and addresses and a copy of the record of\nthe absconder's telephone calls from the facility; and\n(viii)\na photostatic copy of the memo of\nagreement form which the absconder signed prior to leaving the\nfacility. (6)\n\nThe\nchairperson of the temporary release committee shall afterwards forward one of\neach of these five absconder packets along with a letter requesting assistance\nin apprehending the absconder to: (i) Absconder Search Unit\n\nInspector General's Office\n\nNew York State Department of Correctional Services\n10-06 35th Avenue\n\nLong Island City, NY 11106\n(ii)\n\nThe New York State Police barracks which\ncovers the geographical area where the absconder went on his program of\ntemporary release. In New York City this address is: New York State Police\n\nViolent Felony Warrant Squad\n\nInwood Station\n\nBronx, NY 10034\n(iii)\n\nThe Division of Parole area office\nwhich covers the geographical area where the absconder had been on temporary\nrelease. This absconder packet to the Division of Parole is for informational\npurposes only in the event that the staff of the area parole office\nunexpectedly learns of the absconder's whereabouts during the course of their\ninvestigations of parolees, and is not to be interpreted as an indication that\nthe Division of Parole has any responsibility whatsoever to seek out the\nabsconder. In New York City these packets should be mailed to: Senior Warrant Officer\n\nWarrant Unit\n\nNew York State Division of Parole\n314 West 40th Street\n\nNew York, NY 10018\n(iv)\n\nTwo copies to: Director of Temporary Release Programs\n\nRoom 308\n\nNew York State Department of Correctional Services\n\nState Office Building Campus, Bldg. 2\n\nAlbany, NY 12226\n(7)\n\nThe director of temporary release\nprograms, upon receipt of the absconder packet from the facility's temporary\nrelease committee chairperson, will have the responsibility to immediately post\na form DCJS-20, wanted person form, with the New York State Division of\n\nCriminal Justice Services alerting both the Division of Criminal Justice\n\nServices (DCJS) and National Crime Information Center (NCIC) systems that the\ninmate is wanted for the crime of absconding from temporary release. Under no\ncircumstances are correctional facilities to forward form DCJS-20 directly to\nthe Division of Criminal Justice Services. (c) Absconder's arrest. Procedures to be\nfollowed. The following procedures shall be followed when any temporary release\nabsconder has a form 4116, warrant for detention and return of temporarily\nreleased inmate, lodged against him: (1)\n\nThe\ninspector general agent, parole officer, or other State employee who lodges the\nwarrant against the absconder shall immediately telephone the director of\ntemporary release programs to alert him where and when the warrant was\nlodged. (2)\n\nThat same employee\nshall afterwards telephone the correctional facility from which the inmate\nabsconded from temporary release and request that both the facility's head\ncorrectional clerk and temporary release committee chairperson be alerted where\nand when the warrant was lodged. (3)\n\nThe director of temporary release\nprograms, upon being advised that a warrant has been lodged, will alert the\n\nDepartment of Correctional Services command control center in central office\nabout the warrant being lodged against the absconder and shall afterwards file\na form DCJS-20, cancel notice, with the New York State Division of Criminal\n\nJustice Services alerting both the Division of Criminal Justice Services and\n\nNational Crime Information Center systems that the inmate is no longer\nwanted. (4)\n\nThe chairperson of the\ntemporary release committee at the facility from which the inmate absconded, upon being alerted that the inmate has had a warrant lodged against him, shall\nafterwards telephone the director of temporary release programs, to make\nabsolutely certain that a warrant has, in fact, been lodged. (5)\n\nOnce the temporary release committee\nchairperson verifies with the director of temporary release programs that a\nwarrant has actually been lodged against the absconder, the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson shall prepare five short memos stating that the absconder\nis back in custody, giving the date and location where the warrant was lodged, and requesting that the agency in question discontinue its efforts to search\nfor the absconder. Most importantly, this memo should request that the agency\nin question immediately return the form 4116, warrant for detention and return\nof temporarily released inmate, to the temporary release committee chairperson. Copies of this memo should then be forwarded to: (i) Absconder Search Unit\n\nInspector General's Office\n\nNew York State Department of Correctional Services\n10-06 35th Avenue\n\nLong Island City, NY 11106\n(ii)\n\nThe New York State Police barracks which\nwas first notified when the inmate absconded from temporary release. In New\n\nYork City this address is: New York State Police\n\nViolent Felony Warrant Squad\n\nBox 61\n\nInwood Station\n\nBronx, NY 10034\n(iii)\n\nThe Division of Parole area office\nwhich was first notified when the inmate absconded from temporary release. In\n\nNew York City this address is: Senior Warrant Officer\n\nWarrant Unit\n\nNew York State Division of Parole\n314 West 40th Street\n\nNew York, NY 10018\n(iv)\n\nTwo copies to: Director of Temporary Release Programs\n\nRoom 308\n\nNew York State Department of Correctional Services\n\nState Office Building Campus, Bldg. 2\n\nAlbany, NY 12226\n(v) Any local police jurisdiction notified of\nan absconder shall be notified when that absconder is back in\ncustody. (6)\n\nThe\ntemporary release committee chairperson shall follow-up to make certain that\nall temporary release absconder warrants which were mailed out when the inmate\nabsconded are returned to the facility file (except, of course, the warrant\nwhich is filed against the inmate as a detainer). It is important that the\ntemporary release committee chairperson assure that all other warrants are\nactually returned to the facility, as these nonreturned warrants could possibly\nresult in the inmate being mistakenly and illegally arrested when he is\nreleased from custody in the future. Besides creating unnecessary work for the\narresting law enforcement agency and inconvenience and hardship for the inmate, an illegal arrest under such circumstances could result in an inmate bringing a\nlegal suit for damages against the Department of Correctional Services in the\ncourts. (7)\n\nIn those cases where an\ninmate has been confined in other custody within New York State awaiting trial\nfor new criminal charges or to serve a new local sentence, the temporary\nrelease committee chairperson shall maintain regular contact with the inmate's\nnew place of custody to follow the progress of the pending criminal charges and\nto make certain that the department's form 4116, warrant, continues to be on\nfile as further detainer. When the inmate is due to be released from local\ncustody, the temporary release committee chairperson, in coordination with the\ndirector of temporary release programs, shall arrange for the inmate's return\nto Department of Correctional Services custody. (8)\n\nIn those cases where an inmate has been\nconfined in other custody outside of the State of New York, the director of\ntemporary release programs shall contact the appropriate officials in the other\nstate to follow-up on the progress of any new criminal charges and to make\ncertain the department's form 4116, warrant, continues to be on file as further\ndetainer. The director of temporary release programs shall also be responsible\nto determine whether or not the inmate is willing to waive extradition from the\nother state and shall initiate extradition proceedings in the event that the\ninmate indicates a refusal to waive extradition back to New York. Once the\ninmate is scheduled to be released from out-of-state custody, the director of\ntemporary release programs, in coordination with the department's\nabsconder/escape extradition and return unit, shall arrange for the absconder's\nreturn to Department of Correctional Services custody. (d) Receiving a returned\nabsconder--procedures to be followed. The following procedures shall be\nfollowed when any temporary release absconder is returned to a Department of\n\nCorrectional Services facility. (1)\n\nThe head\ncorrectional clerk at the receiving facility shall notify both the head\ncorrectional clerk at the facility from which the inmate absconded and the\ndirector of temporary release programs that the absconded inmate has been\nreturned to his facility. (2)\n\nThe\nhead correctional clerk at the receiving facility shall then contact the\ndirector of classification and movement for a transfer order to have the inmate\nreturned to the facility from which he absconded, provided, the original\nfacility is a maximum security facility. However, if it is not a maximum\nsecurity facility, the head correctional clerk at the facility where the\nabsconder is received shall secure from the director of classification and\nmovement a T.O. to an appropriate maximum security facility as close to the\nfacility from which the inmate absconded as possible so that the original\nfacility may more easily conduct a superintendent's hearing on the absconded\ninmate. (3)\n\nThe head correctional\nclerk at the facility where the absconder is received shall prepare form 2054, notice of returned violator, and forward copies of this form to central office. He shall also make certain that the facility's temporary release committee\nchairperson at the original facility is aware of the absconded inmate's\nreturn. (4)\n\nAn employee having\nknowledge of the absconding offense should complete a misbehavior report and\nprepare charges for a superintendent's hearing. (5)\n\nIn all cases, the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson at the facility from which the inmate absconded shall\nfollow-up to make certain that a superintendent's hearing is completed on the\nabsconding charge. (6)\n\nAbsconding\nfrom temporary release is a felony crime. Therefore, once the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson at the facility from which the inmate absconded becomes\naware that a superintendent's hearing has affirmed an absconding charge, the\ntemporary release committee chairperson should, as soon as possible, forward a\nwritten statement to the prosecuting attorney or district attorney in the\ncounty where the facility is located, alerting the district attorney about the\ninmate's abscondence, return, and present status, and request that the district\nattorney bring new criminal charges of violation of Penal Law 205.17, absconding from temporary release, 1st degree against the inmate. A copy of\nthis letter to the district attorney is to be forwarded to the director of\ntemporary release programs so that it may be included in the inmate's central\noffice case file. (v) New arrest procedures of short-term\ntemporary release participants. (a) If an\ninmate is arrested while participating in a short-term temporary release\nprogram, the Department of Correctional Services employee who first becomes\naware of the arrest shall immediately report this information to the facility's\ntemporary release committee chairperson, head correctional clerk and\nsuperintendent. (b) The temporary\nrelease committee chairperson, or in his absence whoever is designated by the\nsuperintendent, shall have the responsibility of contacting the arresting\nagency in order to secure the details of the new arrest (date, place, charge, arresting officer, precinct of arrest in New York City, arrest number in New\n\nYork City, and court disposition to date). This will be followed up by a short\nmemo to the case folder, Division of Parole folder and director of temporary\nrelease programs. (c) If the\ntemporary release committee chairperson learns that criminal charges are\npending as a result of an inmate's new arrest while on temporary release, a\nform 4116, warrant of detention and return of temporarily released inmate, shall immediately be issued and shall be lodged against the inmate at his place\nof confinement. (d) If the new\narrest charge was dismissed when the inmate appeared in court on the charge, the facility superintendent or acting superintendent shall make a decision\nwhether or not a form 4116, warrant, shall be issued. (e) Whether or not a form 4116, warrant, is\nissued, the superintendent or acting superintendent, shall see to it that the\ndepartment's command control center is advised of the arrest, and given the\ndetails of the arrest if they are available. (f) The temporary release committee\nchairperson at his earliest opportunity shall telephone the director of\ntemporary release programs and provide him with the details of the new arrest. He shall also make certain that the facility's head correctional clerk has been\nadvised of the arrest. (g) In the\nevent that a temporary release participant is held in other custody following\nhis new arrest and is unable to return to the facility, the head correctional\nclerk is to drop him from the official facility count as an absconder. This\naction is to be taken in spite of the fact that the inmate's whereabouts is\nvery well known to all concerned, and in spite of the fact that he is not to be\nconsidered a temporary release absconder for legal or other administrative\npurposes, and is not to have criminal or departmental charges filed against him\nfor absconding from temporary release. However, the facility remains free, and\nis encouraged, to bring departmental charges against the inmate for other\nreasons connected with the new arrest (i.e., new convictions, abuse of alcohol, use of illegal drugs, out-of-bounds of confinement, etc.). (h) In those cases where a temporary release\nparticipant is arrested in New York State and is held in other custody to\neither await trial or to serve a new local sentence, the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson shall monitor all stages of the court process in regards\nto the inmate's pending criminal charges until there has been a court\ndisposition. The temporary release committee chairperson shall then maintain\nregular contact with the inmate's new place of custody to make certain that he\nis still confined there and that the department's form 4116, warrant, continues\nto be on file as further detainer. When the inmate is due to be released from\nlocal custody, the temporary release committee chairperson, in coordination\nwith the director of temporary release programs, shall arrange for the inmate's\nreturn to Department of Correctional Services custody. (i) In those cases where a temporary release\nparticipant is arrested out-of-state and is being held in out-of-state custody\nto either await trial or to serve a new sentence, the director of temporary\nrelease programs shall monitor all stages of the court process in regards to\nthe inmate's pending criminal charges until there has been a court disposition. The director of temporary release programs shall then maintain regular contact\nwith the inmate's new place of custody to make certain that he is still\nconfined there and that the department's form 4116, warrant, continues to be on\nfile as further detainer. The director of temporary release programs shall also\ndetermine whether or not the inmate is willing to waive extradition from the\nother state, and shall initiate extradition proceedings in the event that the\ninmate indicates a refusal to waive extradition back to New York. (4)\n\nReports to central\noffice. (i) A temporary release furlough/leave\nof absence result document will be completed and sent to the director of\ntemporary release programs upon the completion of all actions regarding the\nimmediately completed temporary release activity. Nonpoint scoring facilities\nwill generate their own form or report. Contained in that locally developed\nreport will be: (a) the inmate's name, DIN, and facility; (b) the type of\ntemporary release participation; (c) inclusive dates of the\nparticipation; (d) whether or not\nthe activity has been deemed successful; and\n(e) if not, any disciplinary\nproceedings/dispositions. (ii)\n\nThe yellow copy of the memo of agreement\nwill be sent to central office for each participation. (iii)\n\nTemporary release program monthly\nreports (forms 4114, 4115, 4115.1 and 4115.2) are due in the office of the\ndirector of temporary release programs no later than the fifth working day of\nthe succeeding month.
