If such motion is\nfiled, the documents or other materials shall be deemed as designated by the\n\nProducing Party unless and until the Court rules otherwise. Notwithstanding\nanything herein to the contrary, the Producing Party bears the burden of\nestablishing the propriety of its designation of documents or information as\n\nConfidential Information or Highly Confidential - Attorney's Eyes-Only\n\nInformation. 5.
