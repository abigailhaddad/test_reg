Contractors with contracts which provide for\npayment at specific dates or intervals shall also be required to provide a\nproper invoice which certifies that the obligations required under such\ncontract have been performed prior to such date(s) or during such interval(s), and review and verification of the work of these contractors will take place\nupon receipt of such proper invoice; payment shall be made in accordance with\nthe terms of such contracts. (b) Prompt payment schedule. The schedule of the time in which the trust will make\nprompt payment under a contract is as follows: (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) or\n(3) of this subdivision, payment will be made by the trust within 30 calendar\ndays, excluding legal holidays, after receipt of a proper invoice. (2)\n\nFor contracts which provide for payment\nat one or more specific dates or intervals, payment will be made in accordance\nwith the terms of such contracts, but interest shall only be payable if payment\nis not made within the time provided in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nThis schedule will\nnot apply in those instances where payment is being delayed by reason of any of\nthe exceptions listed in subdivision (d) of this section, or where the time in\nwhich to make payment is being tolled for any of the reasons listed in\nsubdivision (e) of this section, in which cases the time for payment shall be\nas there provided. (c) Interest computation. (1)\n\nIf the trust fails\nto make payment in accordance with the prompt payment schedule set forth in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, the trust will pay interest to the affected\ncontractor at the rate equal to that set by the State Tax Commission for\ncorporate taxes pursuant to section\n1096 (e)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nThe trust shall not be\nliable for payment of interest when such interest as computed pursuant to the\nprovisions of paragraph (1) of this subdivision is less than $10. (d) Extension of payment time. Any\nof the following facts, conditions or situations are determined by the trust to\nbe exceptions to the prompt payment schedule set forth in subdivision (b) of\nthis section, and to justify extensions of the time by which payment must be\nmade (the amount of time of such extension being as established by the trust's\ntreasurer consistent with this Part, with notice provided to the contractor): (1)\nstatutory or contract provisions\nrequiring an inspection period or an audit prior to payment in order to\ndetermine the resources applied or used by a contractor in fulfilling the terms\nof the contract; (2)\nthe absence of\na State appropriation which is necessary to authorize payment; (3)\na requirement of Federal government\nexamination and approval of a proper invoice prior to payment; (4)\nextraordinary delay between the time of\nthe provision of goods, property or services by a contractor and the receipt of\na proper invoice by the trust; (5)\nfailure by a contractor to submit documents required by the contract or\nreasonably required by the trust prior to payment; (6)\ntime is taken in the processing of an\ninvoice by the State Department of Taxation and Finance, the State Division of\nthe Budget, the Office of the State Comptroller, the City of New York Office of\n\nManagement and Budget, the Office of the New York City Comptroller, or any\nother entity external to the trust that is or may be required by statute, regulation or contract to approve or process trust payments; or\n(7)\nsuch date by which contract payment must\nbe made is modified in accordance with subdivision (e) of this\nsection. (e) Defects or\nimproprieties. (1)\n\nThe following facts or\nconditions toll the prompt payment schedule set forth in subdivision (b) of\nthis section: (i) a reasonable belief by the\ntrust in the existence of any defect(s), including any incompleteness or\nfailure of compliance with the terms of the contract, in or with respect to the\ngoods, property or services delivered; (ii)\na reasonable belief by the trust in the\nexistence of any defect(s) in the invoice; or\n(iii)\na reasonable belief by the trust in\nsuspected impropriety of any kind. (2)\n\nIn order to toll the prompt payment\nschedule without penalty, the trust has 15 calendar days after receipt of an\ninvoice to send a contractor notification of such defects or improprieties. Trust notification shall be by letter to the contractor setting forth any such\ndefect or impropriety in reasonable detail, sent to the address indicated for\nnotices under the contract or, if no such address is provided, sent to the\naddress set forth in the invoice; provided that, in the event that the trust\nfails to so notify the contractor within such 15 days, the sole effect of such\nfailure to so notify the contractor shall be that the number of days allowed\nfor payment shall be reduced by the number of days between such 15th day and\nthe date of the trust's transmitting such notification. In the event that the\ntrust fails to provide reasonable grounds for its contention that any such\ndefect or impropriety exists, the date by which contract payment shall be made\nshall be calculated from the date of receipt of an invoice.
