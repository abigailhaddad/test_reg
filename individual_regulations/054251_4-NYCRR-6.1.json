  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 6.1 - Certification for payment for services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Certifications. In order to provide for the payment of salary or compensation\nto officers and employees on any regular scheduled payday, the appointing\nauthority shall furnish to the Civil Service Department, on prescribed forms, at least five days before the same is required by the appropriate fiscal or\ndisbursing officer, the names of the persons to be paid, the title of the\nposition held or kind of service performed by each, the rate of compensation, and such other information as the Civil Service Department may require. Such\nappointing officer shall certify that the persons named are employed in the\nperformance of duties appropriate to their respective positions and employments\nas indicated. The Civil Service Department shall examine such forms; and if it\nfinds that the persons names therein are employed in accordance with law, and\nrules made pursuant to law, it shall so certify. The Civil Service Department\nthereafter shall transmit such forms to the appropriate fiscal or disbursing\nofficer for further audit and payment as required by law. (b) Extended certifications. The Civil\n\nService Department may certify the employment of a person for a limited or\nextended period. No further certification shall be necessary for the payment of\ncompensation to any such person so long as his status remains unchanged during\nthe stated limited period, if any, of his employment. The Civil Service\n\nDepartment, however, may at any time examine the payroll of any department, agency or authority for any period, and shall examine such a payroll at least\nonce each year to determine that all persons employed in such department, agency or authority are employed in accordance with the Civil Service Law and\nrules. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or preclude the\n\nCivil Service Department from terminating or rescinding a certification at any\ntime by giving notice thereof to the appropriate fiscal or disbursing\nofficer. (c) Temporary\ncertifications. When the name of any person is first submitted for\ncertification following his appointment, reinstatement, promotion, transfer, or\nother change in status, and the Civil Service Department requires further\ninformation or time to enable it to make a final determination thereon, the\ndepartment may certify such person temporarily pending such final\ndetermination. In such event the department shall immediately request the\nnecessary additional information from the appointing authority, who shall\nfurnish the same forthwith. If such information is not furnished promptly, or\nif the Civil Service Department finds, following receipt of such information, that the employment of such person is not in accordance with the law and rules, the department shall immediately terminate such certification by notice to the\nappropriate fiscal or disbursing officer. (d) Refusal or termination of certification. Upon satisfactory evidence of intention to evade the provisions of the law or\nthis Chapter in assigning any employee to perform duties other than those for\nwhich he was examined and certified or under any title not appropriate to the\nduties to be performed, the Department of Civil Service shall refuse\ncertification or shall terminate a certification previously made and then in\nforce.
