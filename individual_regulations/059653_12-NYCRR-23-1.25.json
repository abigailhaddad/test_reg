  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-1.25 - Welding and flame cutting operations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Compressed gas cylinders. (1)\n\nCylinder storage. Compressed gas\ncylinders not in use shall be stored in an upright position remote from open\nflames, radiators and other sources of heat, buildings or other structures and\nfrom any combustible material and shall be protected from the sun and high\ntemperatures or fire-resistant shields shall be provided. Such cylinders shall\nbe so arranged or placed that they will not be knocked over or damaged by\npassing or falling objects, equipment or materials. Cylinders containing oxygen\nshall not be stored near cylinders containing combustible gas, combustible\nmaterial, oil or grease or in other areas where a spontaneous combustion hazard\nexists. Cylinder valves shall be closed at all times when not in use. (2)\n\nControl valves and regulators. (i) The control valve of any compressed gas\ncylinder shall be located at the domed end of such cylinder and when not in use\nsuch control valve shall be protected by a suitable cap or ring guard. A key or\nwrench shall be maintained on the spindle of every compressed gas cylinder at\nall times during use. (ii)\n\nEach\ncompressed gas cylinder in use shall be provided with a pressure regulator or\nan automatic pressure reducing device. (3)\n\nUse. (i) Compressed gas cylinders shall be raised\nor lowered only in suitable cradles. The use of ordinary slings for such\npurpose is prohibited. (ii)\n\nCompressed gas cylinders shall not be dropped or thrown from any\nheight. (iii)\n\nCompressed gas\ncylinders shall be placed in an upright position when in use. (iv)\n\nDuring use each compressed gas cylinder\nshall be securely fastened to a stationary object unless other suitable\nprovision has been made to keep it from falling over. (v) During use a compressed gas cylinder\nshall be located at least six feet from any combustible material or from any\nheating device. (vi)\n\nEmpty\ncompressed gas cylinders shall be immediately removed from working areas and\nstored in designated safe locations. The valves of such cylinders shall be\nclosed and tags or signs indicating that such cylinders are empty shall be\nattached thereto. The use of compressed gas cylinders as rollers, props or\nsupports is prohibited. (b) Hose and hose connections. (1)\n\nAll hose shall be first quality and of a\ntype manufactured for use on construction or demolition job sites. Hose used\nfor oxygen cylinder connections shall have fittings of a different design that\nhose used for compressed gas connections. Hose connections shall be of either\nthe ferrule or clamp type. Hose shall be capable of withstanding, without\nleakage, a pressure equal to at least twice the maximum delivery pressure of\nthe pressure regulators provided for the system but not less than 300 pounds\nper square inch gage. (2)\n\nHose\nshall be protected from damage by trucks or other moving construction or\ndemolition equipment. Hose shall be so placed when in use as not to constitute\na falling or tripping hazard. All hose shall be carefully examined at frequent\nintervals for leaks or for signs of excessive wear, damage from abrasion or any\nother deterioration. Defective hose or hose connections shall be immediately\nrepaired or removed from the job site. (c) Torches. (1)\n\nTorches shall be lighted only by means of\nfriction lighters or self-contained electric spark igniters. (2)\n\nWhen torches are changed or when welding\nis halted for more than five minutes, all cylinder valves shall be\nclosed. (3)\n\nMomentary stoppages may\nbe controlled at the torch valves. (d) Protection of persons. All persons\nengaged in welding or flame-cutting operations shall be provided where\nnecessary with proper scaffolds installed and used in compliance with this Part\n(rule). Such persons shall be provided with approved eye protection suitable\nfor the work involved and appropriate protective apparel. When arc welding is\nperformed near other persons, such other persons shall be protected from the\narc rays by opaque screens or by approved eye protection. (e) Fire protection. (1)\n\nOily and greasy substances shall be kept\naway from the areas where cylinders, hose and torches are being used. Cylinder\nvalves and connections shall not be lubricated. (2)\n\nWhere there is a hazard to other persons\nfrom flying particles of metal there shall be provided suitable incombustible\nscreening installed between the welding or flame-cutting operations and such\nother persons. (3)\n\nWhenever welding\nor flame-cutting operations are performed in the vicinity of any combustible\nmaterial there shall be provided, within easy reach of the persons performing\nsuch work, at least one approved fire extinguisher or fire pail filled with an\nappropriate fire extinguishing agent. (f) Explosion hazard. Before any welding or\nflame cutting is done on any tank or container that contained any materials\nwhich may generate a flammable vapor upon the application of heat, all piping\nconnected to such tank or container shall be disconnected or blanked off. Any\nresidual flammable material shall be removed and the tank or container shall be\ncompletely purged with a suitable purging agent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n23-1.25\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
