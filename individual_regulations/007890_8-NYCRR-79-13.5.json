Tit. 8 §§ 79-13.5 - Restricted license\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\naccordance with section\n8610\n(1)\nof the Education Law, the department may\nissue a restricted clinical laboratory license to perform certain examinations\nand procedures within the definition of clinical laboratory technology as set\nforth in section\n8601\n(1)\nof the Education Law, provided that such\na restricted licensee may only perform examinations and procedures in those of\nthe following areas which are specifically listed in his or her certificate: histocompatibility, cytogenetics, stem cell process, flow cytometry/cellular\nimmunology, molecular testing, and toxicology as provided in paragraph (b)(1)\nof this section. (b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of this section, restricted licensees employed\nat the National Cancer Institute designated cancer centers or at teaching\nhospitals that are eligible for distributions pursuant to section\n2807-m\n(3)(c)\nof the Public Health Law may receive a\ncertificate that also includes the practice of molecular testing including by\nnot limited to genetic testing-molecular and molecular oncology, provided that\nsuch certificate holders may practice in such additional areas only at such\ncenters, teaching hospitals or other sites as may be designated by the\ncommissioner. (1)\n\nOnly individuals employed\nin a New York State Department of Health authorized toxicology laboratory, operating under the direction of a clinical laboratory director, may obtain a\ncertificate in toxicology. (c) In addition to the requirements set forth\nin section\n8610\n(1)\nof the Education Law, to qualify for a\nrestricted license, an applicant shall satisfy the following requirements: (1)\n\nProfessional study. The applicant shall\nhave successfully completed a baccalaureate or higher degree program in the\nmajor of biology, chemistry, the physical sciences, or mathematics from a\nprogram registered by the department or determined by the department to be the\nsubstantial equivalent. (2)\n\nTraining program. In accordance with section\n8610\n(1)(c)(iii)\nof the Education Law, the\napplicant shall have completed a training program that meets the following\nrequirements: (i) The training program shall\nhave a planned sequence of supervised employment or engagement in activities\nappropriate for the area of certification, which training program is\nsatisfactory to the department in quality, breadth, scope and nature and is\nprovided by an entity that shall be responsible for the services\nprovided. (ii)\n\nThe training program\nshall be described and attested to by the clinical director of the laboratory\nin which it is located prior to the beginning of the program. (iii)\n\nThe training program shall consist of\nnot less than one year of full-time training in the specific areas in which the\napplicant is seeking certification, which shall consist of no less than 1,750\nhours in a calendar year, in the specific area in which the applicant is\nseeking certification, or the part-time equivalent thereof, as determined by\nthe department. (iv)\n\nSuccessful\ncompletion of the program shall be certified by a laboratory director who is\nresponsible for overseeing such program. (v) The training program shall include the\nfollowing curricula for certificates issued in each of the following areas: (a) For a certificate in the area of\nhistocompatibility, the training program shall include knowledge of clinical\nimmunology, immunogenetics, basic molecular biology, and laboratory\nmathematics. The training program shall also include, but need not be limited\nto, general laboratory principles and skills, including infection control and\naseptic technique; the practice of HLA typing and HLA antibody testing; specimen collection, processing and handling; instrumentation and equipment; reagent preparation and quality control; quality assurance, principles and\ntechniques of histocompatibility assays, and crossmatching; antibody screening\nand identification; and determination of degree of HLA matching. (b) For a certificate in the area of\ncytogenetics, the training program shall include knowledge of chromosome\nstructure/behavior and its correlation with phenotype and recognition and\ninterpretation of chromosomal abnormalities. It shall also include, but need\nnot be limited to, general laboratory principles and skills; clinical\ncytogenetics; general knowledge of human genetics; infection control and\naseptic technique, quality control, and quality assurance; laboratory\nmathematics; the collection, handling, preparation and processing of pertinent\nspecimens; the use of appropriate cell culture techniques; the principles and\ntechniques for harvesting specimens or cell cultures; and the principles and\ntechniques of chromosome banding, staining, analysis, and\ninstrumentation. (c) For a\ncertificate in the area of stem cell process, the training program shall\ninclude knowledge of stem cell biology. It shall also include, but need not be\nlimited to, general laboratory principles and skills; infection control and\naseptic technique methods; instrumentation and equipment; quality control and\nquality assurance; laboratory mathematics; the process of handling stem cell\nspecimens in the laboratory; enumeration and characterization of stem cells; ABO/Rh confirmatory typing; and reagent preparation. (d) For a certificate in the area of flow\ncytometry/cellular immunology, the training program shall include knowledge of\nthe technique for counting, sorting, and characterization of cells suspended in\na fluid stream based on their physical properties and expression of cell\nsurface molecules. The training program shall also include, but need not be\nlimited to, general laboratory principles and skills; infection control and\naseptic technique; instrumentation and equipment; quality control and quality\nassurance; the basic principles of flow cytometry, including specimen\npreparation, fluidics and electronics; fluorochrome selection; antibody\nselection; the design of flow cytometry procedures, including routine\nstandardization and quality management; and specific clinical\napplications. (e) For a certificate\nin the area of molecular testing, the training program shall include: (i) knowledge of nucleic acid chemistry, human molecular biology, molecular pathology, molecular diagnosis, molecular\noncology (including the role of genetics in molecular diagnosis and molecularly\ntargeted therapies), human and microbial molecular genetics, and molecular test\nresult calculation, interpretation, and reporting; (ii)\npracticum in molecular techniques, including but not limited to, nucleic acid isolation, separation, detection, amplification, sequencing, techniques to prevent specimen contamination, and\nadditional molecular techniques as determined by the department; (iii)\nlaboratory operations relevant to\nmolecular testing, including, but not limited to, quality control, quality\nassurance, safety, instrument operation and maintenance, and\n(iv)\nknowledge of applications of molecular\ntesting in the fields of infectious disease, oncology, genetics, genomics, transfusion medicine, pharmacogenomics, and other fields as determined by the\ndepartment; and\n(f) For a\ncertificate in the area of molecular testing as provided in Education Law, section\n8610\n(1)(b), an applicant shall: (1)\nbe employed at a National Cancer\n\nInstitute designated cancer center or at a teaching hospital that is eligible\nfor distributions pursuant to Public Health Law § 2807m(3)(c); and\n(2)\nhave completed the training requirements\nfor the restricted license in molecular testing pursuant to clause (e) of this\nsubparagraph; and\n(3)\nhave\ncompleted additional training requirements for the restricted license in\nmolecular testing acceptable to the department that would enable the applicant\nto practice competently in accordance with section\n8610\n(1)(b)\nof the Education\n\nLaw.
