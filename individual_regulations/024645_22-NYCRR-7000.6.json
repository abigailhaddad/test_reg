If the commission\ndetermines that a hearing is warranted, the procedures to be followed are those\nset forth in section\n44, subdivision\n4, of the Judiciary\n\nLaw. (b) Answer. A judge who is\nserved with a formal written complaint shall serve a verified answer within 20\ndays of service. The answer shall contain denials of those factual allegations\nknown or believed to be untrue. The answer shall also specify those factual\nallegations as to the truth of which the judge lacks knowledge or information\nsufficient to form a belief, and this shall have the effect of a denial. All\nother factual allegations in the charges are deemed admitted. The answer may\nalso contain affirmative and other defenses and may assert that the specified\nconduct alleged in the formal written complaint is not improper or unethical. Failure to answer the formal written complaint shall be deemed an admission of\nits allegations. (c) Summary\ndetermination. Either party may move before the commission for a summary\ndetermination upon all or any part of the charges being adjudicated, if the\npleadings, and any supplementary materials, show that there is no genuine issue\nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to summary\ndetermination as a matter of law. A motion for summary determination may be\nserved in the same manner as a formal written complaint. When a party moves or\ncross-moves for summary determination, it may address findings of fact, conclusions of law, and appropriate sanction, if any. There shall be no oral\nargument unless the commission so directs. In deciding a motion for summary\ndetermination, the commission may (i) render a determination on the charges it\nhas sustained, and/or (ii) refer to a referee or to the parties those charges\nthat have not been decided and which may be adjudicated at a hearing, addressed\nin an agreed statement of facts or stipulation, or may otherwise be addressed, and/or (iii) take other action as may be appropriate.

Subject to the\napproval of the commission, the administrator and the respondent may agree on a\nstatement of facts, conclusions of law and a recommended sanction, and may\nstipulate in writing that the hearing shall be waived.

Only the\nreferee designated by the commission is empowered to issue subpoenas for a\n\nCommission hearing pursuant to a formal written complaint. If Commission\ncounsel or the judge who is the subject of a formal written complaint wishes to\nsubpoena a witness or books, records, documents or other evidence, a request\nmust be made to the referee on notice to the opposing side, affording a\nreasonable opportunity to be heard. The referee shall grant reasonable requests\nfor subpoenas. (f) Motions.
