Tit. 18 §§ 360-7.2 - MA program as payment source of last resort\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhere a third party, such as a health insurer or\nresponsible person, has a legal liability to pay for MA-covered services on\nbehalf of a recipient, the department or social services district will pay only\nthe amount by which the MA reimbursement rate for the services exceeds the\namount of the third party liability. The department or social services district\nwill also pay if the third party payment will not be made within a reasonable\ntime. The department or social services district will seek reimbursement for\nany payments for care and services it makes for which a third party is legally\nresponsible. They will seek reimbursement to the extent of the third party's\nlegal liability unless the amount reasonably expected to be recovered is less\nthan the cost of making the recovery. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§§\n360-7.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
