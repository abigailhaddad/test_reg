  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 90.4 - Index\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\nprovisions. A single index for the open-end account shall be chosen from among\nthe indices approved by the Superintendent of Banks pursuant to Part 333 of\nthis Title. The rate or rates for the open-end account may be based directly on\nthe index values or on the index values plus or minus additional percentage\npoints; provided, however, that variations in the rate or rates shall\ncorrespond directly to movements in the index. This Part imposes no requirement\non lending institutions to place limitations on the adjustment in the rate or\nrates for the open-end account, as such adjustment would otherwise be allowed\nby movements in the index. However, any lending institution which adopts\nlimitations of any kind on changes in the rate shall provide for equal\nlimitations on both increases and decreases. Similarly, rate adjustments may be\nrounded to the nearest percentage point or fraction thereof as determined by\nthe lending institution, provided that rounding applies equally to decreases\nand increases in rates. Subject to the rounding provisions, increases in the\nindex need not be used at each rate calculation date but may be accumulated\nonce to the next rate calculation date, but decreases in the index must be\nreflected at each rate calculation date. (b) Changes in the index. A lending\ninstitution may provide for a substitute index similar to the chosen index only\nin the event that the initial index becomes unavailable. In any other case, if\nthe lending institution proposes to change the index used for the open-end\naccount, application in letter form for permission to do so must be made to the\n\nBanking Board, and, in the case of approval for such change, a notification of\nthe change must be sent to customers at least 30 days prior to the\nchange. (c) Information and\ndisclosures with respect to the history of the index. The disclosure shall\nidentify the index and shall contain a statement that past changes in the index\nare not necessarily predictive of future changes in the index. The lending\ninstitution shall provide the high and low figures for the index and the dates\nat which these levels were reached, for each of the three calendar years\npreceding the calendar year in which the open-end account is opened or when a\nvariable rate provision is added to an existing account. In addition, if an\nopen-end account is opened after August 31st of any calendar year or a variable\nrate provision is added to become effective after August 31st of any calendar\nyear, the disclosure shall include the high and low figures for the index's\nperformance through June 30th of that year, and such disclosure may be used as\nthe disclosure of the high and low in index performance for the calendar year\nnext preceding that calendar year in which the open-end account is opened or a\nvariable-rate provision becomes effective, prior to March 1st of that\nyear.
