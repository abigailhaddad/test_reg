  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.13 - Tenants ledger\n\nState Regulations\nA separate tenants ledger to record all transactions\nwith tenants shall be maintained for each income analysis ledger (see §\n1642-3.8\n). A tenants ledger sheet\nor card shall be prepared for each dwelling unit or commercial space, even\nthough the space may be vacant. Tenants ledger sheets for units in buildings\nwhich have been demolished may be segregated in an inactive section of the\nrespective tenants ledger. A specimen form of tenants ledger sheet designed for\nuse in a hand-posted ledger is shown as Exhibit 20 of Appendix S-8. The\nspecimen form is a loose-leaf sheet, but cards may be used or forms designed\nfor a visible filing system. Where machine-posting is employed, the form must, of course, be adapted to the requirements of the particular machine. Regardless\nof form, the tenants ledger sheet shall show the name of the local agency, the\nproject number, the name and address of the tenant, the account number, the\napartment size, the basic rent, surcharges (if any) and current authorized\nrent, the effective date of tenancy, the move-out and charge-through dates, the\ndate and explanation of each charge and credit and the balance of the tenant's\naccount. The local agency may add such other information as it deems desirable. Each dwelling unit and commercial space shall be assigned, in advance of\ninitial occupancy, a number which shall reflect the building or stair-hall\nnumber and the apartment or commercial space number and which shall be recorded\non the tenants ledger sheet as the account number. The tenants ledger sheets\nshall be arranged in a logical sequence by buildings, stair-halls, and\napartment numbers. The sequence, once established, shall remain constant. The\naccount numbers, once established, shall also remain constant notwithstanding\nthat several tenants may have successively occupied the same unit. As a unit or\nspace is leased, a new ledger sheet or card is prepared for the new tenant, the\nunit being identified by the account number assigned as above. The tenants\nledger is controlled by the tenants charge and credit book (see Subpart 1642-4)\nand the total of the balances in the tenants ledger shall at all times agree\nwith the control. A trial balance of the tenants ledger shall be taken at the\nend of each calendar month and preserved and dated to establish a formal and\nperiodic proof of such agreement. The operation of the tenants ledger, the\ndetails of posting, etc., are described in Subpart 1642-4. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
