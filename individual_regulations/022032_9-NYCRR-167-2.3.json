(d) Package and bag search shall mean the emptying of pockets and opening of bags\nand parcels for inspection. (e) Pat/frisk search shall mean an inspection done over clothing. Persons are\nrequired to remove outer clothing such as coats, hats and shoes and to empty\npockets. All garments and articles are searched carefully including pants\ncuffs, sleeve cuffs and waistbands. The mouth, nose, ears and hair are visually\ninspected. (f) Reasonable suspicion\nshall mean that amount of knowledge sufficient to induce an ordinarily prudent\nand cautious person to act under the circumstances. Reasonable suspicion must\nbe directed at a specific person and be based on specific and articulable facts\nand the logical inferences and deductions which can be drawn from those facts. Examples of reasonable suspicion include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing: --Facility director Doe receives information from two staff\nthat staff X is bringing marijuana into the facility on a certain day. One of\nthe informing staff has given reliable information in the past. There is\nreasonable suspicion to justify a search of staff X. --Resident Jones informs facility director Doe that staff X\nis helping resident Smith to escape from the facility. Another staff confirms\nthis with additional information that X is bringing drugs and a hacksaw on a\ncertain date. There is reasonable suspicion to justify a search of staff\nX. --Facility director Doe receives general rumors from staff\nand a resident informant that staff X is bringing contraband into the facility. Further, the facility director received the same general information from\nanother resident who was an informant for him at another facility. Finally, contraband had been discovered at the facility. There is reasonable suspicion\nto justify a search of staff X. --Resident Jones gives information to the division that\nstaff X is bringing drugs into the facility. There is no evidence that this\nresident had a history of providing reliable information in the past. Further, there is no corroborating evidence. There is NO reasonable suspicion to justify\na search of staff X. The division will not search a specified person or perform\na lock box search based solely on the information of anonymous sources, unless: (1)\nthe information is\ncorroborated by a reliable or credible source; or\n(2)\nthe information received indicates that\nthere is an immediate danger to persons or property. (g) Strip search shall mean an inspection of\nthe naked body of a person and an inspection of the person's clothing and\npersonal effects. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
