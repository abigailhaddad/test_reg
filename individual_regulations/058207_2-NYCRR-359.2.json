  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 359.2 - Applicability\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe rights and benefits provided under article 18 and covered\nby this Part are applicable to members of public retirement systems of the\n\nState. However, article 18 does not permit any transfer to or from a New York\n\nCity system and does not allow granting of retroactive membership or credit\nbased on New York City service (whether or not this service is ordinarily\ncovered by the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System) unless\nsuch city adopts article 18 in its entirety. If the City of New York adopts\narticle 18, the New York City Employees' Retirement System, the New York City\n\nTeachers' Retirement System, the New York City Police Pension Fund, the New\n\nYork City Fire Department Pension Fund and the New York City Board of Education\n\nRetirement System will then be considered \"public retirement systems\" for the\npurposes of article 18. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n359.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
