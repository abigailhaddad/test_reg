(2)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from the well is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the well. (c) Privies adjacent to the well. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind placed or used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 150 feet of the well of the public water supply of the village of Macedon. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle, which is not watertight, placed or used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 300 feet of the well of the public water supply of the village of Macedon.

(4)\n\nWhenever the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers become filled within six inches of the top, said receptacles or containers shall be emptied or removed and the contents disposed of as hereinafter provided in order to maintain the privy or receptacle in proper sanitary condition and effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy.

(6)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into the well, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the said trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.

(2)\n\nNo human excreta and no compost or other matter containing human excreta shall be thrown, placed, piled or spread upon the surface of the ground nor shall such human excreta, compost or other matter containing human excreta be buried in the soil unless covered with not less than 12 inches of soil nor within a distance of 500 feet of the well, and no manure or compost of any kind shall be placed, piled or spread upon the ground within a distance of 100 feet of the well of the public water supply of the Village of Macedon.
