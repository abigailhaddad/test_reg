  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 486.3 - Bonds or other security\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 502, 509(4), 511\n(a) The Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay require any carrier subject to tax to file or deposit and maintain with the\ndepartment: (1)\na bond issued by a surety\ncompany which is: (i) authorized to transact\nbusiness in New York State; (ii)\nregistered with and under the supervision of the Insurance Department of New\n\nYork State; and\n(iii)\napproved by\nthe Superintendent of Insurance as to solvency and responsibility; or\n(2)\nsuch other acceptable security\nenumerated in subdivision (c) of this section. Such bond or security must be in\nsuch amount as the department may require to secure the payment of any monies\nwhich may become due from a carrier under article 21 of the Tax Law. A bond or\nacceptable security may be required to be filed or deposited with the\ndepartment before a carrier is issued any highway use tax permits or at any\ntime thereafter and such bond or security is subject to being increased at any\ntime it is deemed necessary as a protection to the revenues under article 21 of\nthe Tax Law. (b) (1)\n\nPrior to the approval of an application\nfor a permit for any motor vehicle to be operated on the public highways of\nthis State or during any subsequent review of a carrier, the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, in determining the need for and the amount or sufficiency\nof a bond, may: (i) require and analyze an\nestimated six-month tax liability of the applicant or of the carrier based on\nan anticipated or representative number of miles operated on the public\nhighways of New York State and the number and weights of the motor vehicles at\nissue, together with the estimated amount of motor fuel and/or diesel motor\nfuel used in operations within New York State where such fuels are purchased\noutside of this State; (ii)\nrequire\nand analyze current financial statements of the applicant or carrier which have\nbeen independently certified as to reliability by a licensed public accountant\nor by a certified public accountant pursuant to an audit conducted by such\naccountant, with particular emphasis on the ratio of current assets to current\nliabilities and net worth (total assets less total liabilities) as determined\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (iii)\nevaluate any independent information\nconcerning an applicant's or carrier's nature of operations, reliability, overall financial status, liquidity, or history of financial solvency and\nstability; and\n(iv)\nreview the\ntaxpayer's compliance record to determine whether there are or were any\ndelinquencies in filing returns and/or payment of taxes as a carrier subject to\nthe highway use tax or for any other taxes due New York State for which the\napplicant or carrier may be or may have been responsible. (2)\n(i) Current financial statements\nas used in this paragraph means\ncertified financial statements for a 12-month period of time ended not more\nthan 18 months prior to the date such statements are submitted to the\ndepartment. Where such certified financial statements are for a period ended\nmore than six months prior to the date of submission, in addition to such\ncertified financial statements, interim financial statements (on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis) must be submitted to the department for a period of\ntime ending within such six-month period. All financial statements submitted to\nthe department must reflect the individual activities of the applicant or of\nthe carrier, as the case may be. Where a certification is applicable to a\nconsolidated group of entities, the financial spreadsheets upon which the\ncertification was based, together with an analysis of all intercompany\naccounts, must also be provided. The department may require an unqualified\nopinion in support of such statements where it deems such an opinion\nnecessary. (ii)\n\nIf an applicant or\na carrier fails to supply current financial statements which have been\nindependently certified by a licensed public accountant or by a certified\npublic accountant and/or fails to supply an unqualified opinion where necessary\nin support of such statements, as required by this subdivision, the Department\nof Taxation and Finance may deny a permit and/or suspend or revoke any permits\nissued to such applicant or carrier. However, on petition, either through the\nhearing process or on the motion of the department the requirements for a\ncertification by a licensed public accountant or by a certified public\naccountant and for an unqualified supporting opinion may be waived. If such\nrequirements are waived, the department may instead require alternative\ncertification or require the applicant or carrier to file a bond in such amount\nas is deemed appropriate, regardless of the net worth or financial status of\nthe applicant or carrier. (3)\n\nIn general and provided there is no\ninformation which would indicate otherwise, an applicant or a carrier will be, or will not be, required to file and maintain with the department a bond\npursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. Provided further, unless the\napplicant, carrier or the department can establish otherwise, to negate\nvaluation considerations (\ne.g., cost-to-market, intangibles, collectibility of receivables, intercompany accounts, etc.) only 80 percent of\nnet worth shall be recognized for purposes of determining the amount of a bond. (i) Generally, if an applicant's or a\ncarrier's ratio of current assets to current liabilities (current ratio) is at\nleast one-to-one and 80 percent of the net worth is equal to or greater than\nthe six-month tax liability, a bond will not be required. (ii)\n\nGenerally, if an applicant's or a\ncarrier's current ratio is at least one-to-one and 80 percent of the net worth\nis less than the six-month tax liability, a bond will be required for the\ndifference between 80 percent of the net worth and the six-month tax\nliability. (iii)\n\nGenerally, if an\napplicant's or a carrier's current ratio is less than one-to-one and 80 percent\nof the net worth is equal to or greater than the six-month tax liability, a\nbond will be required for one third of the six-month tax liability. (iv)\n\nGenerally, if an applicant's or a\ncarrier's current ratio is less than one-to-one and 80 percent of the net worth\nis less than the six-month tax liability, a bond will be required for the\ngreater of: (a) the difference between 80\npercent of the net worth and the six-month tax liability; or\n(b) one third of such six-month tax\nliability. (v) Generally, the amount of a bond shall not exceed the estimated or\nrepresentative six-month tax liability of the applicant or of the carrier. Where the six-month tax liability cannot be determined, for example where the\napplicant or carrier is unable to furnish an average monthly number of miles\noperated on the public highways of New York State, the amount of a bond\nrequired to be filed and maintained with the department may be fixed by the\ndepartment on any reasonable basis. (vi)\n\nIn addition to subparagraphs (i) through\n(v) of this paragraph, the amount of a bond required, if any, may be adjusted\nwhere any information indicates the need for a bond in greater or lesser\namount. The amount of a bond shall in any event be reasonably related to the\nprobable liability of the carrier under article 21 of the Tax Law. (c) (1)\n\nIn lieu of the bond referred to in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, an applicant or carrier may deposit with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance other security, approved by the department, in such amounts as it may require. Among the kinds of security which may be\nacceptable are the following: (i) certificated\n\nUnited States Treasury Bonds; (ii)\ncertified bonds of New York State; (iii)\ncertificated bonds of any political\nsubdivision of New York State having general governmental powers and in\nconnection with which the credit of the political subdivision is pledged for\nthe payment of the interest and principal due on such bonds; (iv)\nfinancial institution passbooks and\ncertificates of deposit; (v) irrevocable standby letters of credit made payable to the New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance; and\n(vi)\nany other forms of security acceptable\nto the Department of Taxation and Finance. (2)\n(i) Bonds offered as collateral under this subdivision must be certificated and may\nbe either bearer or registered bonds, having maturity dates at least five years\nsubsequent to the date of deposit with the Department of Taxation and Finance. The amount of the bonds will generally be based on the fair market value, not\nto exceed par value on maturity determined as of the date of deposit. If such\nbonds are of the coupon type, the interest coupons must be attached. Certificated registered bonds offered as collateral must be in the name of the\ncarrier and must be accompanied by a properly executed assignment or power of\nattorney with respect to such bonds in such form as the Department of Taxation\nand Finance may require. (ii)\n\nAny\ninterest accruing on bonds offered as collateral under this subdivision shall\nbelong to the carrier. (3)\n(i) Financial institution passbooks and certificates of deposit offered as\ncollateral under this subdivision must represent money on deposit with a\nfinancial institution approved by the Department of Taxation and Finance. Certificates of deposit must have maturity dates at least one year subsequent\nto the date of deposit with the Department of Taxation and Finance. Additionally, financial institution passbooks and certificates of deposit\noffered under this subdivision must be: (a) prepared in the name of the carrier; (b) accompanied by a signed undated\nwithdrawal slip; (c) accompanied by\na properly completed letter of transmittal in such form as the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance may require, advising that the proceeds of such passbook\naccounts or certificates of deposit may be withdrawn by the department and\napplied against any liability of such carrier pursuant to article 21 of the Tax\n\nLaw; provided, however, that any interest accruing on such accounts or\ncertificates shall belong to the carrier; and\n(d) accompanied by a letter prepared on the\nletterhead of the financial institution and signed by an officer of such\nfinancial institution: (1)\nidentifying the\npassbooks or certificates of deposit by account number and confirming that\nwithdrawal of principal from the passbook or certificate of deposit offered as\ncollateral will not be permitted without written consent from the New York\n\nState Department of Taxation and Finance; and\n(2)\nstating that any right of setoff which\nthe financial institution may possess against the carrier resulting from a\ndefaulted obligation of such carrier shall be subservient to the interest of\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance in the passbook or certificate of\ndeposit offered as collateral. (ii)\n\nAny interest accruing on passbooks or\ncertificates offered as collateral under this subdivision shall belong to the\ncarrier. (4)\n\nStandby\nletters of credit offered as collateral under this subdivision must: (i) be irrevocable for such period of time as\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance shall determine; (ii)\nbe made payable to the New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance; (iii)\nbe issued or confirmed by a bank\napproved by the Department of Taxation and Finance; and\n(iv)\ncontain such other payment terms as are\nacceptable to the Department of Taxation and Finance. (5)\n\nAny security deposited with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance pursuant to this subdivision must have a\nfair market value at least equal to the amount of any bond required pursuant to\nsubdivision (b) of this section. Fair market value greater than the par value\nof the security on maturity will not be recognized. Accepted marketable\nsecurities deposited as security under this subdivision shall be kept in the\njoint custody of the Comptroller and the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance\nand may be sold by the Department of Taxation and Finance, should it become\nnecessary to do so in order to recover any sums due from the carrier pursuant\nto article 21 of the Tax Law. No such sale shall be had until after the carrier\nhas had an opportunity to litigate the validity of any tax at issue, in the\nmanner set forth in section\n510\nof the Tax Law, if such carrier elects\nto do so. Upon any such sale of securities, the surplus, if any, above the sums\ndue under article 21 of the Tax Law, shall be returned to such\ncarrier. (d) The\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance may deny, suspend or revoke any permit, upon\na failure to file or increase the amount of a bond or a failure to deposit or\nincrease the amount of acceptable security when required by the department, or\nfor any failure to maintain in full force and effect such bond or security. A\nbond may be required to be filed with the department, acceptable security may\nbe required to be deposited with the department or the amount of such bond or\nsecurity may be required to be increased at any time it is deemed necessary to\nsecure the payment of any sums due pursuant to article 21 of the Tax Law. Unless otherwise required, such bond or acceptable security must be filed, deposited or increased within 30 days of the date of a notice and demand\ntherefor. In the event a bond is not filed, acceptable security is not\ndeposited or such bond or security is not increased within the time set by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, a notice of denial, suspension or\nrevocation shall be mailed to the applicant or the carrier. In addition to\ndenying, suspending or revoking any highway use tax permit, in the case of the\nfailure to file a bond or deposit acceptable security or increase the amounts\nthereof, the Department of Taxation and Finance may forward a written statement\nof facts showing such failures to the New York State Department of Motor\n\nVehicles which shall suspend all registration plates of all motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, dollies or other devices, subject to the provisions of\narticle 21 of the Tax Law, of such applicant or carrier on account of such\nfailures. (e) Any determination\npursuant to this section with respect to the necessity for or the amount of a\nbond or acceptable security or any increase to the amounts of such bond or\nsecurity may be challenged through a hearing process, provided a petition for\nreview of such determination is timely filed.
