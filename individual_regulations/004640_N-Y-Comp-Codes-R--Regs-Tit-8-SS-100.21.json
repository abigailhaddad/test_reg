Provided that for schools or districts with subgroups that fail to\nmeet the minimum n size requirements, a school and/or district baseline will be\nestablished when such subgroup meets the minimum n size requirements, for the\npurpose of establishing Measures of Interim Progress. (v) State Measures of Interim Progress (State\nMIPs). For each accountability measure that a State baseline has been\nestablished, the Commissioner shall establish for each accountability subgroup\nannual State MIPs. Prior to the start of the 2018-19 school year, the\n\nCommissioner shall establish State MIPs for the 2017-2018 through the 2021-2022\nschool years. The Commissioner shall annually establish new State MIPs for the\nschool year next succeeding the last school year for which State MIPs had been\npreviously established. (vi)\n\nSchool\nand District Measures of Interim Progress (school and district MIPs). For each\naccountability measure for which a school or district baseline has been\nestablished, the Commissioner shall establish for each accountability subgroup\nannual school and district MIPs. Prior to the start of the 2018-2019 school\nyear, the Commissioner shall establish school and district MIPs for the\n2017-2018 through the 2021-2022 school years. The Commissioner shall annually\nestablish new school and district MIPs for the school year next succeeding the\nlast school year for which school and district MIPs had been previously\nestablished. In the event that a school and/or district undergoes a significant\nchange in student enrollment as determined by the Commissioner, including but\nnot limited to a change in grade configuration or a significant increase or\ndecrease in numbers of students who are members of an accountability subgroup, the district may petition the Commissioner to revise the school and/or district\nspecific MIPs assigned to one or more accountability subgroups for one or more\naccountability measures in the school. (vii)\n\nState Long-term goal shall mean the\namount of progress the State expects each accountability subgroup to make, based on the State baseline, at the end of a five-year period towards achieving\nthe State End-goal. Exceeding Long-term goal is determined by subtracting the\n\nLong-term goal from the State-End-goal, dividing by 2, and then adding the\nresult to the Long-term goal. The outcome must be at or above that resulting\nnumber. (viii)\n\nState End-goal shall\nmean the ultimate desired performance at an undetermined future point for an\naccountability subgroup on an accountability measure for which a State\n\nLong-term goal has been established. (ix)\n\nStudent growth means the change in\nstudent achievement for an individual student between two or more points in\ntime. (x) The Mean Student Growth\n\nPercentile means the result of a statistical model that calculates each\nstudent's change in achievement between two or more points in time on a State\nassessment and compares each student's performance to that of similarly\nachieving students. (xi)\n\nThe\nout-of-school suspension rate shall mean the number of students who were\nsuspended from school (not including in-school suspensions) for one full day or\nlonger anytime during the school year divided by the number of students\nenrolled on BEDS day of that school year commencing with data collected for the\n2022-2023 school year. A student is counted only once, regardless of whether\nthe student was suspended one or more times during the school year. For the\n2023-2024 school year results, the Commissioner shall report for each\naccountability group for which a school or district is accountable a Level from\n1-4 based on the out-of-school suspension rate. For the 2023-2024 school year\nresults, districts must implement the provisions of 100.21(i)(4) for any\nschools that have an accountability group that performs at Level 1 on the\nout-of-school suspension indicator. Beginning with the 2024-2025 school year\nresults, the out-of-school suspension indicator shall be incorporated into the\nmethodology used to determine the accountability status of schools and\ndistricts under this section. (xii)\n\nAccountability cohort.

(f) Accountability system for schools and\ndistricts. (1)\n\nAccountability system for\nelementary and middle schools. (i) CSI\nschool. An elementary/middle school shall be preliminarily identified as a CSI\nschool using the following decision table, which combines the following\nmeasures of student performance for all students in the school: (1)\n\nComposite Performance: (2)\n\nStudent Growth: (3)\n\nCombined Composite Performance and\n\nStudent Growth: (4)\n\nEnglish\n\nLanguage Proficiency: (5)\n\nAcademic\n\nProgress: and\n(6)\n\nChronic\n\nAbsenteeism. A school shall be preliminarily identified as a CSI school if one\nor more of the rows in the decision table are applicable to the school: provided that in order to be preliminarily identified using the decision table\nbelow, a performance level must be assigned at a minimum to the Combined\n\nComposite Performance and Student Growth measure and one or more of the\nfollowing measures: English Language Proficiency, Academic Progress, and/or\n\nChronic Absenteeism. Decision Table for Identification of Comprehensive\n\nSupport and Improvement Elementary/Middle Schools\n\nComposite Performance Level\n\nStudent Growth Level\n\nCombined Composite Performance & Growth\n\nLevel\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency\n\nLevel\n\nAcademic Progress Level\n\nChronic Absenteeism Level\n\nBoth Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nAny Level\n\nAny Level\n\nEither Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nNone*\nAny One of the Two is Level 1\n\nEither Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nAny Level\n\nEither Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 2\n\nAny Level 1\n\nEither Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 3 or 4\n\nBoth Level 1\n*\"None\" means there were not enough English language\nlearners to meet the minimum n-size requirement. (a) Composite Performance Level. For each\npublic elementary/middle school whose all students subgroup meets the minimum\nn-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this\nsection, a Composite Performance Level using the results of ELA and Mathematics\nassessments in grades 3-8 and Science assessments for grades 4 and 8 shall be\ncomputed by the Commissioner in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first determine an\nELA and a Mathematics Achievement Index for each public school in the State. The ELA and the Math Achievement Index is a number between 0-250 that is\ncomputed separately for ELA and math for a subgroup by summing the number of\ncontinuously enrolled students who scored at Level 2, plus the number of\ncontinuously enrolled students who scored at Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the\nnumber of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 4 multiplied by\n2.5 (numerator) and dividing this result by the greater of the number of\ncontinuously enrolled students in the subgroup with valid test scores or 95% of\ncontinuously enrolled students (denominator). The result of this division is\nthen multiplied by 100. (2)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then determine a Science Achievement Index for each public\nschool in the State. The Science Achievement Index is a number between 0-250\nthat is computed for Science for a subgroup by summing the number of\ncontinuously enrolled students who scored at Level 2, plus the number of\ncontinuously enrolled students who scored at Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the\nnumber of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 4 multiplied by\n2.5 (numerator), and dividing this result by the greater of the number of\ncontinuously enrolled students in the subgroup with valid test scores or 95% of\ncontinuously enrolled students (denominator). The result of this division is\nthen multiplied by 100. (3)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then compute the Weighted Average Achievement Index, which\nis a number between 0-250 that is computed as the weighted average of the ELA, Mathematics, and Science achievement indices. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then rank order\nschools based on their performance on the Weighted Average Achievement\n\nIndex. (5)\n\nEach elementary/middle\nschool will then be assigned a Weighted Average Achievement Level from 1-4\nbased on such rank ordering using the table below: Weighted Average Achievement\n\nRank\n\nWeighted Average Achievement\n\nLevel\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(6)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then compute the Core Subject Performance Index, which\nis a number from 0-250 that is computed by summing for elementary/middle-level\nELA, Mathematics, and Science, the number of continuously enrolled students who\nscored at Level 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored\nat Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students\nwho scored at Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), and dividing this result\nby the number of valid test results for continuously enrolled students in ELA, Mathematics, and Science (denominator). The result of this division is then\nmultiplied by 100 to determine the Index. (7)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then rank order\nschools by the Core subject Performance Index. (8)\n\nEach elementary/middle school will then\nbe assigned a Core subject Performance Level 1-4 based on such rank ordering\nusing the table below: Core subject\n\nCore\n\nPerformance Index Rank\n\nSubject Performance Level\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(9)\n\nThe Commissioner shall combine the results of the Weighted Average Achievement\n\nLevel as calculated in subclause (5) with the Core Subject Performance Index\n\nLevel as calculated in subclause (8) to create a Composite Performance Index. The Composite Performance Index for elementary/middle schools is a calculation\nby which the results of the Weighted Average Achievement Level and the Core\n\nSubject Performance Index Level are combined to be used as a measure of\nacademic achievement pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section. Provided\nthat, for elementary/middle schools in the State with the same Composite\n\nPerformance Index, the Commissioner shall rank order schools using the higher\nof the Weighted Average Achievement rank order as calculated in subclause (4)\nor the Core subject Performance Index rank order as calculated in subclause (7)\nof this clause. (10)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then assign a Composite Performance Achievement Level from\n1-4 for all schools based on the Composite Performance Index rank ordering\ndescribed in subclause (9) of this clause using the table below: Composite Performance Index\n\nRank\n\nComposite Performance Level\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n\nThe resulting Composite Performance Level is then used in\nthe table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of\nthis section as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether\nthe school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (11)\n\nIf the all students subgroup does not\nmeet the minimum n size, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this\nsection, then the school shall be identified using the established process for\nsmall schools (self-assessment process), as described in paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (b) Student Growth Level. For each public\nelementary/middle school whose all students subgroup meets the minimum n-size\nrequirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, a\n\nStudent Growth Level will be determined in accordance with the following steps: (1)\nA mean growth percentile for the all\nstudents subgroup in each school shall be calculated by adding the student\ngrowth percentile scores for continuously enrolled students in grades 4-8 ELA\nto the student growth percentile scores for continuously enrolled students in\ngrades 4-8 math for the current and the previous two school years in which the\n\nState Grade 3-8 ELA and math assessments have been administered, and dividing\nthe result by the total number of student growth percentile scores in those\ngrades/subjects and years; (2)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then create a rank ordered list of school performance based\non the school's Mean Growth Percentile score. (3)\nA Student Growth Level from 1-4 shall\nthen be assigned to each school using the table below: Mean Growth Percentile\n\nStudent Growth Level\n45 or less\n1\n45.1 to 50\n2\n50.1 to 54\n3\n\nGreater than 54\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting Student Growth Level is then used in the table described in\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple\nmeasures of student performance to determine whether the school is\npreliminarily identified as a CSI school. (c) Combined Composite Performance and Growth\n\nLevel. For each public elementary/middle school meeting the minimum n-size\nrequirement as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, a\n\nCombined Composite Performance and Student Growth Level shall be computed by\nthe Commissioner in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall generate a\ncombined Composite Performance and Student Growth rank ordered list by summing\na school's Composite Performance Index final rank order as described in\nsubclause (9) of clause (a) of this subparagraph and the school's Student\n\nGrowth rank order as described in clause (b) of this subparagraph. (2)\n\nIf there is no Student Growth Level for\nthe school because the all students subgroup did not meet the minimum n size\nfor the Student Growth measure, then the Combined Composite Performance and\n\nStudent Growth Level shall be determined using the Composite Performance Level\nonly. (3)\nA Combined Composite\n\nPerformance and Student Growth Level from 1-4 shall then be assigned to each\nschool based on the school's placement on a rank ordered list in comparison\nwith other schools in accordance with the following table: Rank Based on Combined Composite\n\nPerformance and Student Growth\n\nLevel\n\nIn the lowest 10%\n1\n\nBetween 10 1% and 50%\n2\n\nBetween 50 1 and 75%\n3\n\nIn the highest 75%\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting Combined Composite Performance and Student Growth Level is then\nused in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the\nschool is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (d) English Language Proficiency Level. For\neach public elementary/middle school meeting the minimum n-size requirements as\ndefined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner\nshall compute an English Language Proficiency Level in accordance with the\nfollowing steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall\nfirst determine an initial level of proficiency and the corresponding years\nthat the student was identified as an English Language Learner based upon the\nstudent's performance on the NYSESLAT in the initial year of identification as\nan English Language Learner pursuant to Part 154 of this Title. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine\nprogress rates for each student based on the years that the student has been\nidentified as an English language learner and the level achieved on the\nNYSESLAT in the first year in which the student was identified as an English\n\nLanguage Learner pursuant to Part 154 of this Title. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then calculate\neach school's success ratio based on all continuously enrolled students'\nresults compared to continuously enrolled students' progress rates, as\ndetermined by the Commissioner. Utilizing this information, each school shall\nthen be assigned an English Language Proficiency Level from 1-4 in accordance\nwith the following table: Success Ratio\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency\n\nLevel\n0-0.49\n1\n0.50-0.99\n2\n1.0-1.24\n3\n1.25+\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting English Language Proficiency Level is then used in the table\ndescribed in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of\nmultiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall be\npreliminarily identified as a CSI School. (e) Academic Progress Level. For each public\nelementary/middle school meeting the minimum-size requirement as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall\ncompute an Academic Progress Level in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall calculate separate\nELA and Mathematics Academic Achievement Indices from 0-250 for the all\nstudents subgroup in the school. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a\nseparate State MIP and Long-term goal for ELA and Mathematics. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall determine a\nseparate school MIP in ELA and in Mathematics. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign an\n\nAcademic Progress Level in ELA from 1-4 using the table below based on each of\nthe following: whether or not the school's ELA Academic Achievement Index met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State\n\nLong-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school's\nMIP. (5)\n\nThe Commissioner\nshall then assign an Academic Progress Level in Mathematics from 1 to 4 using\nthe table below based on each of the following: whether or not the school's\n\nMathematics Academic Achievement Index met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP and/or, (3)\nthe school's MIP. Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower of State or School MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher of State or School MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(6)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then average the\nELA Academic Progress Level assigned in subclause (4) of this clause and the\n\nMathematics Academic Progress Level assigned in subclause (5) of this clause. The resulting average Academic Progress Level will be rounded down to the\nnearest whole number that represents the level that will be used and an\n\nAcademic Progress Level from 1-4 will be assigned. The resulting Academic\n\nProgress Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to\ndetermine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI\nSchool. (7)\n\nNotwithstanding the\n\nAcademic Progress Level resulting from the table above, using the all students\nsubgroup's baseline performance as measured by the previous school year test\nresults, for purposes of the accountability designation, if the all students\nsubgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP but increases the\n\nAchievement Index by an amount at least equal to the difference between the\nhigher of the school's current year MIP and prior year MIP or the current year\n\nState MIP and prior year State MIP, the all students subgroup will be assigned\nan Academic Progress Level 2. Provided further that, if the all students\nsubgroup meets either but not both of the school and State MIP for that\nsubgroup and makes progress that is equivalent to at least three times the\ndifference between the lower of the school specific current and prior year MIPs\nand the State current and prior year MIPs for that subgroup, but if such\nprogress is insufficient for the subgroup to meet the higher of the State or\nschool MIP or the Long-term goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned an\n\nAcademic Progress Level 3. (f) Chronic Absenteeism Level. For each\npublic elementary/middle school meeting the minimum n-size requirement pursuant\nto subparagraph (xvii) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the\n\nCommissioner shall compute a Chronic Absenteeism Level in accordance with the\nfollowing steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall\nfirst compute the school's Chronic Absenteeism Rate, which means the number of\nstudents enrolled during the school year in a school for a minimum of ten\ninstructional days and in attendance at least one of those days who were absent\n(excused or unexcused) for at least 10 percent of enrolled instructional days\ndivided by the total number of students enrolled during the school year, expressed as a percentage. Suspensions are not counted as excused or unexcused\nabsences, as suspended students are required to be provided with instruction\nwhile they are suspended. At the elementary/middle level. Chronic Absenteeism\nis calculated for grades 1-8 and ungraded age equivalent students. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a\n\nState MIP and Long-term goal for Chronic Absenteeism. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall also determine a\nschool MIP for Chronic Absenteeism. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a\n\nChronic Absenteeism Level from 1-4 based on whether the school's Chronic\n\nAbsenteeism Rate, as defined in this clause met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school MIP. Utilizing this\ninformation, each school shall then be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level\nfrom 1-4 in accordance with the following table: Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(5)\n\nThe resulting Chronic Absenteeism Level\nis then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine\nwhether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding the Chronic Absenteeism\n\nLevel generated by the table above, for purposes of the accountability\ndesignation, if the all students subgroup does not meet the lower of the State\nor school MIP but decreases the Chronic Absenteeism Rate by an amount equal to\nthe difference between the lower of the school's current year MIP and prior\nyear MIP or the current year State MIP and prior year MIP for the all students\nsubgroup, the all students subgroup will be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism\n\nLevel 2. Provided further that, if the all students subgroup meets either but\nnot both the school and State MIP for that subgroup and makes progress in\ndecreasing the Chronic Absenteeism Rate that is equivalent to three times the\ndifference between the lower of the school specific current and prior year MIP\nand the State current and prior year MIP for the all students subgroup, but if\nsuch progress is insufficient for the all students subgroup to meet the more\nrigorous of the State or school MIP or the State Long-term goal, the all\nstudents subgroup will be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level 3. (7)\n\nProvided further that, notwithstanding\nthe Chronic Absenteeism Level determined pursuant to paragraphs (4), (5) and\n(6), the Commissioner may assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level 1 to an all\nstudents subgroup whose chronic absenteeism rate is below a percent established\nby the Commissioner and the Commissioner may assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level\n2 to an all students subgroup whose chronic absenteeism rate is at or above a\npercent established by the Commissioner. (g) For feeder schools: The Weighted Average\n\nAchievement Index and Level, the Core Subject Performance Index and Level, the\n\nComposite Performance Index and Level, and the Academic Progress Level of\npublic schools, school districts, and charter schools serving grades 1 and/or\n2, but not grade 3 or higher (hereafter referred to as \"feeder schools\") will\nbe determined using back mapping. In school districts with such feeder schools\nand in school districts that accept grade 3 students from feeder schools in\nother school districts by contract, the grade 3 State assessment results for\neach feeder school student will be attributed to the feeder school as well as\nto the school in which the student took the assessment. The student's results\nwill be attributed to a feeder school only if the student was continuously\nenrolled in the feeder school from BEDS day until the end of the school year in\nthe highest grade served by the feeder school. For feeder schools, the Combined\n\nComposite Performance and Growth Level will be determined using the\n\nElementary/Middle-Level ELA and Math Composite Performance Level\nonly. (ii)\n\nTargeted Support and Improvement (TSI) Elementary/Middle Schools. An\nelementary/middle school shall be preliminarily identified as a TSI school if\nthe school meets the criteria for identification outlined in the table below\nfor two consecutive school years for the same accountability subgroup, except\nthat a school identified as a Priority or Focus School during the 2017-2018\nschool year may be identified, using 2017-2018 school year data only, if such\nschool meets the criteria for identification as a TSI school beginning with the\n2018-2019 school year. (a) The decision table\nbelow combines multiple measures of performance for accountability subgroups in\nthe school using the same methodology used to designate CSI schools pursuant to\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph and using the following accountability\nmeasures: (1)\n\nComposite\n\nPerformance; (2)\n\nStudent\n\nGrowth; (3)\n\nCombined Composite\n\nPerformance and Student Growth; (4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency; (5)\n\nAcademic Progress; and\n(6)\n\nChronic\n\nAbsenteeism. (b) The\ndesignations for TSI schools shall be based on the performance of\naccountability subgroups, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of\nthis section and shall not include the performance of the all students\naccountability subgroup: provided that, in order to be preliminarily identified\nusing the decision table below, a performance level must be assigned to, at a\nminimum, the Combined Composite Performance and Student Growth measure and one\nor more of the following measures: English Language Proficiency, Academic\n\nProgress, and/or Chronic Absenteeism.

(c) If a school meets the identification\ncriteria for both a CSI and TSI school, the school shall be designated as a CSI\nschool: provided however that if in the year in which a CSI school is removed\nfrom CSI identification and such school meets the criteria for a TSI school, the school shall be designated as a TSI school. (d) When the Commissioner creates a rank\nordered list for the racial/ethnic subgroup for purposes of identification of\nTSI schools, one rank ordered list will be generated for all racial/ethnic\ngroups combined. (iii)\nTSI schools identified for additional support. (a) Beginning with the 2018-2019 school year, for each year in which the Commissioner identifies CSI schools based on the\nperformance of the all students subgroup in accordance with subparagraph (i) of\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (f) of this section, the Commissioner shall\nidentify for additional targeted support any TSI school with a subgroup whose\nperformance would have caused the school to be identified as a CSI school using\nthe methods for identification specified in subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (b) Such school shall be\nidentified for additional targeted support only if the school had been\nidentified as a TSI school in the prior school year and remains so identified\nin the current school year. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) of this subparagraph, in assigning\n\nPerformance Levels for the purpose of determining whether the performance of a\nsubgroup in a TSI school would have caused the school to be identified as a CSI\nschool, the Commissioner shall: (1)\n\nAssign to\nthe subgroup the Weighted Average Achievement Level that would have been\nassigned to the all students subgroup with the same Weighted Average\n\nAchievement Index for purposes of identifying CSI schools. (2)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Core Subject\n\nPerformance Index Level that would have been assigned to the all students\nsubgroup with the same Core Subject Performance Index for purposes of\nidentifying CSI schools. (3)\n\nAssign\nto the subgroup the Composite Performance Achievement Level that would have\nbeen assigned to the all students subgroup with the same Weighted Average\n\nAchievement Level, Weighted Average Achievement Index ranking. Core Subject\n\nPerformance Index Level and Core Subject Performance Index ranking for purposes\nof identifying CSI schools. (4)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Student Growth Level that would have been assigned\nto the all students subgroup with the same Mean Student Growth Percentile for\npurposes of identifying CSI schools. (5)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Combined\n\nComposite Performance and Student Growth Level that would have been assigned to\nthe all students subgroup with the same Combined Composite Performance and\n\nGrowth rank for purposes of identifying CSI schools. (6)\n\nFor measures of English Language\n\nProficiency; Academic Progress: and Chronic Absenteeism as defined in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall use the State MIP and\n\nState Long-term goal applicable to the all students subgroup to determine the\nsubgroup's performance level on these\nmeasures. (2)\n\nAccountability system for high schools. (i) CSI schools. A high school shall be\npreliminarily identified as a CSI school using the following decision table, which combines multiple measures of performance for all students in the school, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, using the\nfollowing accountability measures: (1)\n\nComposite Performance; (2)\n\nGraduation Rate; (3)\n\nCombined\n\nComposite Performance and Graduation Rate; (4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency; (5)\n\nAcademic Progress; (6)\n\nChronic Absenteeism; and\n(7)\n\nCollege, Career, and Civic Readiness: provided that in order to be preliminarily identified using the decision table\nbelow a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Combined\n\nComposite Performance and Graduation Rate measure and one or more of the\nfollowing measures: English Language Proficiency: Academic Progress: Chronic\n\nAbsenteeism: and/or College, Career, and Civic Readiness (\"CCCR\"). A school\nshall be preliminarily identified as a CSI school if it meets any of the\nconditions in the rows of the decision table below. Provided, however, that\nnotwithstanding the table below, beginning with 2017-2018 school year\ngraduation results, any public high school with a Four-Year Graduation Rate\nbelow 67 percent and a Five-Year or Six-Year Graduation Rate that is not at or\nabove 67 percent will be preliminarily identified as a CSI school.

(a) Composite Performance Level. For each\npublic high school whose all students group, as an accountability subgroup\ndefined in subparagraph (x) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this\nsection, meets the minimum n-size requirements pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section, a Composite Performance Level using the\nresults of the ELA, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies assessments for\nthe Accountability Cohort shall be computed by the Commissioner in accordance\nwith the following steps: (1)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall first calculate a Performance Index separately for ELA, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies at the secondary level using the\nfollowing formula for each subject: (i) The\nsum of the number of students in the Accountability Cohort who scored at Level\n2, plus the number who scored at Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the number who\nscored at Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), divided by the number of\nstudents in the Accountability Cohort as defined in paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section (denominator). The result of this division is\nthen multiplied by 100 to establish the Performance Index for each subject\narea. (2)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then combine the Performance Indices for ELA, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies to calculate a Composite Performance Index in\naccordance with the following formula: (i) The sum of the ELA Performance Index multiplied by three, plus the result of\nthe Mathematics Performance Index multiplied by three, plus the result of the\n\nScience Performance Index multiplied by two, plus the result of the Social\n\nStudies Performance Index multiplied by one, divided by the sum of the\nmultipliers used to make this calculation. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then rank order\nschools based on their Composite Performance Index in accordance with subclause\n(2) of this clause, except that upon a finding of extenuating or extraordinary\ncircumstances, the Commissioner may in creating the rank ordered list exclude\nfrom the rankings those schools that meet the criteria established in\nsubparagraphs (vii) and (xviii) of paragraph (b) of this section as well as\nschools that are implementing a plan for school closure or phase out that has\nbeen approved by the Commissioner. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a\n\nComposite Performance Achievement Level for all schools based on the rank\nordering described in subclause (3) of this clause using the table below: Composite Performance Index\n\nRank\n\nComposite Performance Achievement\n\nLevel\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n*\"The Commissioner may exclude from the rank ordered list\nschools defined in subparagraph (VII) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of\nthis section or schools defined in subdivision 8 of section\n4001\nof the\n\nEducation Law. The resulting Composite Performance Achievement Level is\nthen used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the\nschool shall be preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (5)\n\nIf the all students subgroup does not\nmeet the minimum n size for the Composite Performance Achievement Level, as\ndefined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, then the school\nshall be identified using the established self-assessment process, as described\nin paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section. (b) Graduation Rate Level. For each public\nhigh school meeting the minimum n-size requirement pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute a Graduation\n\nRate Level for the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rate, as\napplicable in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first determine a\n\nState MIP and Long-term goal based on the State Four-Year, Five-Year, and\n\nSix-Year Graduation Rate. (2)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall also determine a school MIP based on the school's Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rate. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a\n\nGraduation Rate Level from 1 to 4 based on the average of the school's\n\nFour-Year, Five-Year and Six-Year Graduation Rates, as available, based on\nwhether or not the school met, exceeded, or failed to meet each of the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe State Long-term\ngoal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school MIP for the\n\nFour-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rate in accordance with the\nfollowing table: Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then average the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year\n\nGraduation Rate Level, as applicable to the school. The resulting average\n\nGraduation Rate Level will be rounded to the nearest level for a Graduation\n\nRate Level from 1-4. (5)\n\nThe\nresulting Graduation Rate Level is then used in the table described in\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of multiple\nmeasures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily\nidentified as a CSI school. (6)\n\nAfter the Graduation Rate Level has been assigned to the school, the\n\nCommissioner shall create a Graduation Rate rank order list by first rank\nordering schools by Graduation Rate Level and then rank ordering schools by\ntheir average Graduation Rate within each level. (7)\n\nProvided, however, that notwithstanding\nthe table above, any public high school with a graduation rate of 67 percent or\nbelow on the Four-Year Graduation Rate cohort that does not have a Five-Year or\n\nSix-Year Graduation Rate Cohort at or above 67 percent shall be preliminarily\nidentified as a CSI school. (8)\n\nProvided further that, notwithstanding the Graduation Rate Level generated by\nthe table above, for purposes of the accountability designation, if the all\nstudents subgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP but\nincreases the graduation rate by an amount at least equal to the difference\nbetween the lower of the school's current year MIP and prior year MIP or the\n\nState's current year MIP and prior year MIP for the all students subgroup, the\nall students subgroup will be assigned a Graduation Rate Level 2. Provided\nfurther that, if the all students subgroup meets either but not both of the\nschool and State MIP for the all students subgroup and makes progress that is\nat least equal to three times the difference between the lower of the\nschool-specific current and prior year MIPs and the State's current and prior\nyear MIPs for the all students subgroup, but if such progress is insufficient\nfor the all students subgroup to meet the higher of the State or school MIP or\nthe Long-term goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned a Graduation\n\nRate Level 3. (9)\n\nProvided further\nthat, notwithstanding the Graduation Rate Level determined pursuant to\nparagraphs (7) and (8), the Commissioner may assign a Graduation Level 1 to an\nall students subgroup whose unweighted average Four-Year, Five-Year, and\n\nSix-Year graduation rates are below a percent established by the Commissioner\nand the Commissioner may assign a Graduation Level 2 to an all students\nsubgroup whose unweighted average Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year graduation\nrates is at or above a percent established by the\n\nCommissioner. (c) Combined Composite Performance and\n\nGraduation Rate Level. For each public high school meeting the minimum n-size\nrequirement as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, a\n\nCombined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate Level shall be computed by\nthe Commissioner in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall generate a\ncombined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate rank ordered list by summing\na school's Composite Performance Index rank order, as described in clause (a)\nof this subparagraph, and the school's Graduation Rate rank order as described\nin clause (b) of this subparagraph. (2)\nA Combined Composite Performance and\n\nGraduation Rate Level from 1-4 shall then be assigned to each school based on\nthe school's Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate ranking in\naccordance with the following table. Rank Based on Combined Composite\n\nPerformance and Graduation Rate Rankings\n\nCombined Composite Performance &\nGraduation Rate Level\n\nIn the lowest 10%\n1\n\nBetween 10.1% and 50%\n2\n\nBetween 50.1 and 75%\n3\n\nIn the highest 75%\n4\n*\"The Commissioner may exclude from the rank ordered list\nschools defined in subparagraph (VII) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of\nthis section or schools defined in subdivision 8 of section\n4001\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (3)\n\nThe\nresulting Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate Level shall then\nbe used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the\nschool is preliminarily identified as a CSI school: provided that if the all\nstudents subgroup does not meet the minimum n size for the Graduation Rate\nmeasure, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, then\nthe Combined Composite Performance and Graduate Rate Level will be determined\nusing the Composite Performance Level only. (d) English Language Proficiency Level. For\neach public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirements as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall\ncompute an English Language Proficiency Level in accordance with the following\nsteps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first\ndetermine an initial level of proficiency and the corresponding years that the\nstudent was identified as an English Language Learner based upon the student's\nperformance on the NYSESLAT in the initial year of identification as an English\n\nLanguage Learner pursuant to Part 154 of this Title. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine\nprogress rates for each student based on the years identified as an English\nlanguage learner and the level achieved on the NYSESLAT in the first year in\nwhich the student was identified as an English Language Learner pursuant to\n\nPart 154 of this Title. (3)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then calculate each school's success ratio based on all\ncontinuously enrolled students' results compared to the continuously enrolled\nstudents' progress rates, as determined by the Commissioner. Utilizing this\ninformation, each school shall then be assigned an English Language Proficiency\n\nLevel from 1-4 in accordance with the following table: Success Ratio\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency\n\nLevel\n0-0.49\n1\n0.50-0.99\n2\n1.0-1.24\n3\n1.25+\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting English Language Proficiency Level is then used in the table\ndescribed in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of\nmultiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall be\npreliminarily identified as a CSI school. (e) Academic Progress Level. For each public\nhigh school meeting the minimum n-size requirement as defined in paragraph (1)\nof subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute an Academic\n\nProgress Level in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall calculate separate\nELA and Mathematics Academic Achievement Indices from 0-250 for the all\nstudents subgroup in the school. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a\nseparate State MIP and Long-term goal for ELA and Mathematics. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall determine a\nseparate school MIP in ELA and Mathematics. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign an\n\nAcademic Progress Level in ELA from 1-4 using the table below based on each of\nthe following: whether or not the school's ELA Academic Achievement Index met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State\n\nLong-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school's\nMIP. (5)\n\nThe Commissioner\nshall then assign an Academic Progress Level in Mathematics from 1-4 using the\ntable below based on whether the school's Mathematics Academic Achievement\n\nIndex met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe\n\nState MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school\nMIP. Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower of State or School MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher of State or School MIR\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(6)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then average the\nELA Academic Progress Level assigned in subclause (4) of this clause and the\n\nMathematics Academic Progress Level assigned in subclause (5) of this clause. The resulting average Academic Progress Level will be rounded down to the\nnearest whole number that represents the level that will be used and an\n\nAcademic Progress Level from 1-4 will be assigned. The resulting Academic\n\nProgress Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to\ndetermine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI\nschool. (7)\n\nNotwithstanding the\n\nAcademic Progress Level resulting from the table above, using the all students\nsubgroup's baseline performance as measured by the previous school year test\nresults, for purposes of the accountability designation, if the all students\nsubgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP but increases the\n\nAchievement Index by an amount at least equal to the difference between the\nhigher of the school's current year MIP and prior year MIP or the current year\n\nState MIP and prior year State MIP, the all students subgroup will be assigned\nan Academic Progress Level 2. Provided further that, if the all students\nsubgroup meets either but not both of the school and State MIPs for that\nsubgroup and makes progress that is equivalent to at least three times the\ndifference between the lower of the school-specific current and prior year MIPs\nand the State current and prior year MIPs for that subgroup, but if such\nprogress is insufficient for the subgroup to meet the higher of the State or\nschool MIP or the Long-term goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned an\n\nAcademic Progress Level 3. (f) Chronic Absenteeism Level. For each\npublic high school meeting the minimum n-size requirement pursuant to paragraph\n(1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute a\n\nChronic Absenteeism Level in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first compute the\nschool's Chronic Absenteeism Rate, which means the number of students enrolled\nduring the school year in a school for a minimum of ten instructional days and\nin attendance at least one of those days who were absent (excused or unexcused)\nfor at least 10 percent of enrolled instructional days divided by the total\nnumber of students enrolled during the school year, expressed as a percentage. Suspensions are not counted as excused or unexcused absences, as suspended\nstudents are required to be provided with instruction while they are suspended. At the high school level, chronic absenteeism is calculated for grades nine-12\nand ungraded age equivalent students. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a\n\nState MIP and Long-term goal for Chronic Absenteeism. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall also determine a\nschool MIP for Chronic Absenteeism. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a\n\nChronic Absenteeism Level from 1-4 based on whether the school's Chronic\n\nAbsenteeism Rate, as defined in this clause met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school MIP. Each school shall then be\nassigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level from 1-4 in accordance with the following\ntable: Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(5)\n\nThe resulting Chronic Absenteeism Level\nis then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine\nwhether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding the Chronic Absenteeism\n\nLevel generated by the table above, for purposes of the accountability\ndesignation, if the all students subgroup does not meet the lower of the State\nor school MIP but decreases the Chronic Absenteeism Rate by an amount equal to\nthe difference between the lower of the school's current year MIP and prior\nyear MIP or the current year State MIP and prior year MIP for the all students\nsubgroup, the all students subgroup will be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism\n\nLevel 2. Provided further that, if the all students subgroup meets either but\nnot both the school and State MIP for that subgroup and makes progress toward\ndecreasing the Chronic Absenteeism Rate that is equivalent to three times the\ndifference between the lower of the school specific current and prior year MIP\nand the State current and prior year MIP for the all students subgroup, but if\nsuch progress is insufficient for the all students subgroup to meet the higher\nof the State or school MIP or the State Long-term goal, the all students\nsubgroup will be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level 3. (7)\n\nProvided further that, notwithstanding\nthe Chronic Absenteeism Level determined pursuant to paragraphs (4), (5) and\n(6), the Commissioner may assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level 1 to an all\nstudents subgroup whose chronic absenteeism rate is below a percent established\nby the Commissioner and the Commissioner may assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level\n2 to an all students subgroup whose chronic absenteeism rate is at or above a\npercent established by the Commissioner. (g) College, Career, and Civic Readiness\n\nLevel. For each public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirement\npursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner\nshall compute a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Index. (1)\n\nThe Index is calculated using the number\nof students in the 4-Year Graduation Rate Cohort as of June 30 of the reporting\nyear plus any members of the English language learner subgroup who earn a\n\nRegents Diploma with a Seal of Biliteracy who are not members of the 4-Year\n\nGraduation Rate Cohort as the denominator. (2)\n\nThe numerator is the number of these\nstudents demonstrating success on specific college, career, and civic readiness\nusing specific measures multiplied by the weighting (0.5 to 2.0) assigned to\neach of these measures in accordance with table below plus the number of\nstudents who earned a High School Equivalency diploma in the current reporting\nyear and students who were members of the English language learner subgroup at\nthe time of graduation who earned a Regents Diploma with a Seal of Biliteracy\nin the reporting year, regardless of whether or not they were in the 4-year\n\nGraduation Rate Cohort. In accordance with the provisions of Section\n100.5\nof this Part: Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation\n\nRegents or Local Diploma with CTE Technical\n\nEndorsement\n\nRegents Diploma with Seal of Biliteracy\n\nRegents Diploma and score of 3 or higher on an\n\nAdvanced Placement exam\n\nRegents Diploma and score of 4 or higher on an\n\nInternational Baccalaureate exam\n\nRegents or Local Diploma and the passage of\nnationally certified Career and Technical\n\nEducation (CTE) examination\n\nRegents Diploma and high school credit earned\nthrough participation in dual enrollment (in high school and accredited\ncollege) course\n\nSkills and achievement commencement credential as\nprovided in section\n100.6\n(a) of\nthis\n\nPart and a Level 4 on the New York State\n\nAlternate Assessment for students with disabilities as defined in section\n100.1\n(t)(2)\nof\nthis Part. Annual ELL and earned Regents with Seal of\n\nBiliteracy in current reporting year and not in 4- year graduation-rate\ncohort\n2.0\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Section\n100.5\nof this Part: Regents Diploma and high school credit earned\nthrough participation in an Advanced\n\nPlacement course\n\nRegents Diploma and high school credit earned\nthrough participation in an International\n\nBaccalaureate course\n\nRegents Diploma with Career Development and\n\nOccupational Studies (CDOS) endorsement\n\nSkills and achievement commencement credential as\nprovided in section\n100.6\n(a) of\nthis\n\nPart and Level 3 on the New York State Alternate\n\nAssessment for students with disabilities as defined in section\n100.1\n(t)(2)\nof\nthis Part. 1.5\n\nRegents or Local Diploma only in accordance with\nprovisions of section\n100.5\nof this Part Skills and\nachievement commencement credential as provided in section\n100.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart and an achievement Level 2 on the NYSAA\n1.0\n\nAnnual high school equivalency diploma\nrecipients\n(included in numerator but not\ndenominator)\n\nNew York State career development and\noccupational studies commencement credential as provided in section\n100.6\n(b) of this\n\nPart. 0.5\n\nNo high school diploma or high school equivalency\ndiploma. 0\n\nTo determine the College, Career, and Civic Readiness\n\nIndex, the numerator is divided by the denominator, and the result is\nmultiplied by 100. (3)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then assign a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level\nfrom 1 to 4 based on the table below and whether or not the College, Career, and Civic Readiness Index met, exceeded, or failed to meet each of the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe State Long-term\ngoal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school MIP. Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting College, Career, and Civic\n\nReadiness Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to\ndetermine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI\nschool. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding the\n\nCollege, Career, and Civic Readiness Level generated by the table above, using\nthe all students subgroup's baseline performance as measured by the previous\nschool year test results, for purposes of the accountability designation, if\nthe all students subgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP\nbut increases the College, Career, and Civil Readiness Index by an amount at\nleast equal to the difference between the higher of the school's current year\nMIP and prior year MIP or the State current year MIP and prior year MIP, the\nall students subgroup will be assigned a College, Career, and Civic Readiness\n\nLevel 2. Provided further that, if the all students subgroup meets either but\nnot both of the school and State MIP for that subgroup and makes progress that\nis equivalent to at least three times the difference between the lower of the\nschool-specific current and prior year MIPs and the State current and prior\nyear MIPs for that subgroup, but if such progress is insufficient for the\nsubgroup to meet the higher of the State or School MIP or the Long-Term Goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned a College, Career, and Civic\n\nReadiness Level 3, (6)\n\nProvided\nfurther that, notwithstanding the College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level\ndetermined pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), and (5), the Commissioner may assign\na College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level 1 to an all students subgroup\nwhose College, Career, and Civic Readiness Index is below a benchmark\nestablished by the Commissioner and the Commissioner may assign a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level 2 to an all students subgroup whose College, Career, and Civic Readiness Index is at or above a benchmark established by the\n\nCommissioner. (ii)\n\nTargeted Support and Improvement High\n\nSchools. A high school shall be preliminarily identified as a TSI school if the\nschool meets the criteria for identification outlined in the table below for\ntwo consecutive school years for the same accountability subgroup, except that\na school identified as a Priority or Focus School during the 2017-2018 school\nyear may be identified, using 2017-2018 school year data only, if such school\nmeets the criteria for identification as a TSI school beginning with the\n2018-2019 school year. (a) The decision table\nbelow combines multiple measures for accountability subgroups in the school\nusing the same methodology used to designate CSI schools pursuant to\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph and using the following accountability\nmeasures: (1)\n\nComposite\n\nPerformance: (2)\n\nGraduation\n\nRate: (3)\n\nCombined Composite\n\nPerformance and Graduation Rate: (4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency: (5)\n\nAcademic Progress: (6)\n\nChronic Absenteeism: and\n(7)\n\nCollege, Career, and Civic\n\nReadiness. (b) The\ndesignations for TSI schools shall be based on the performance of\naccountability subgroups, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of\nthis section and shall not include the performance of the all students\naccountability subgroup: provided that in order to be preliminarily identified\nusing the decision table below a performance level must be assigned to, at a\nminimum, the Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate measure and one\nor more of the following measures: English Language Proficiency: Academic\n\nProgress: Chronic Absenteeism: and/or College, Career, and Civic Readiness. Decision Table for Identification of Targeted Support\nand Improvement High Schools\n\nComposite Performance Level\n\nGraduation Rate Level\n\nCombined Composite Performance &\nGraduation Rate Level\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency\n\nLevel\n\nProgress Level\n\nChronic Absenteeism Level\nCCCR Level\n\nBoth Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nAny Level\n\nAny Level\n\nEither Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nNone*\nAny One of the Three is Level 1\n\nEither Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nAny Level\n\nEither Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 2\n\nAny Level 1\n\nEither Level 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 3 or 4\n\nAny Two Level 1\n*\"None\" means that there are not a sufficient number of\n\nEnglish Language Learners to meet the minimum n-size\nrequirement. (c) If a high\nschool meets the identification criteria for both a CSI and TSI school, the\nhigh school shall be designated as a CSI school: provided however that if in\nthe year in which a CSI school is removed from CSI identification and such\nschool meets the criteria for a TSI school, the school shall be designated as a\nTSI school. (d) When the\n\nCommissioner creates a rank ordered list for the racial/ethnic subgroup for\npurposes of identification of a TSI school, one rank ordered list will be\ngenerated for all racial/ethnic groups combined. (iii)\nTSI High Schools identified for\nadditional support. (a) Beginning with the\n2018-2019 school year, for each year in which the Commissioner identifies CSI\nschools based on the performance of the all students subgroup in accordance\nwith subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of this section, the\n\nCommissioner shall identify for additional targeted support any TSI high school\nwith a subgroup whose performance would have caused the school to be identified\nas a CSI school using the methods for identification specified in subdivision\n(f) of this section. (b) Such high\nschool shall be identified for additional targeted support only if the school\nhad been identified as a TSI school in the prior school year and remains so\nidentified in the current school year. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause\n(a) of this subparagraph, in assigning Performance Levels for the purpose of\ndetermining whether the performance of a subgroup in a TSI school would have\ncaused the school to be identified as a CSI school, the Commissioner shall: (1)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Composite\n\nPerformance Level that would have been assigned to the all students subgroup\nwith the same Composite Performance Index for purposes of identifying CSI\nschools. (2)\n\nAssign to the subgroup\nthe Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate Level that would have\nbeen assigned to the all students subgroup with the same Combined Composite\n\nPerformance and Graduation Rate ranking for purposes of identifying CSI\nschools. (3)\n\nFor the Graduation\n\nRate, Academic Progress, Chronic Absenteeism, and the College, Career, and\n\nCivil Readiness measures, the Commissioner shall use the State MIPS and\n\nLong-term goals applicable to the all students subgroup to determine the\nsubgroup's levels on these indicators. (3)\n\nTarget Districts. (i) Any school district with one or more CSI\nor TSI schools identified pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be\nidentified as a Target District. (ii)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of\nthis section to the contrary, the Commissioner shall apply the accountability\nmeasures for identification as a CSI or TSI school to the school district as a\nwhole, and if such district meets the criteria for identification as a CSI or\nTSI school, the district shall be identified as a Target District in accordance\nwith the timelines and procedures prescribed in this section for identification\nof CSI schools and TSI schools. (g) For each school preliminarily identified\nas a TSI school or CSI school, and for each school district preliminarily\nidentified as a Target District pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, the school district or charter school shall be given the opportunity to present\nto the Commissioner additional data and/or any relevant information concerning\nextenuating or extraordinary circumstances faced by the school or district that\nshould be cause for the Commissioner not to identify the school as a CSI or TSI\nschool or the district as a Target District. (h) Public notification of identification as\na CSI or TSI school or a Target District. (1)\n\nUpon receipt of a designation as a CSI or TSI school or Target District, the\nboard of education (in New York City, the chancellor or the chancellor's\ndesignee) or charter school board of trustees shall take appropriate action to\nnotify the general public of the issuance of such designation. Such action\nshall include, but not be limited to, direct notification, within 30 days of\nreceipt of the Commissioner's designation, in English and translated, when\nappropriate and to the extent practicable for the most frequently used\nlanguages in the district, into the recipient's native language or mode of\ncommunication, to persons in parental relation of children attending the school\nthat it has been designated as a CSI or TSI school, or Target District and\ndisclosure of such designation by the school district at the next public\nmeeting of the local board of education or by the charter school board of\ntrustees at the next public meeting. (2)\n\nEach school year during which a school\nremains identified as a CSI or TSI school or Target District, by June 30th or\nat the time of a student's initial application or admission to the school, whichever is earliest, the board of education or charter school board of\ntrustees shall provide direct notification to parents or other persons in\nparental relation to children attending the school or district, as applicable, that the school or district remains a CSI or TSI school or Target District, as\napplicable. Such notification shall include a summary of the actions that the\nschool district and school are taking to improve student results and an\nexplanation of any district programs of choice, magnet programs, transfer\npolicies, or other options that a parent or a person in parental relation may\nhave to place the child in a different public school within the school\ndistrict. Such notification shall include the timelines and process for parents\nexercising their rights to school choice. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraphs (1) or (2) of this subdivision, in the event that a CSI school has\nbeen identified as a struggling school or a persistently struggling school\npursuant to section\n100.19\nof this Part and/or a school\nunder registration review pursuant to this section, the district may use a\nsingle notification to fulfill the annual public notification requirements of\nthis section and section\n100.19\n(c)(1)(ii)\nof this Part. (i) Interventions. Beginning with accountability designations made on or after July\n1, 2018, all CSI and TSI schools and Target Districts shall implement all\ninterventions applicable to such designations under this subdivision. Provided, however, that a charter school identified as a CSI or TSI school shall not be\nrequired to implement the interventions applicable to the school accountability\ndesignation pursuant to this subdivision and, in lieu of such interventions, such identified charter school shall take such actions as are required by its\ncharter authorizer pursuant to Article 56 of the Education Law consistent with\nthe charter agreement that each charter school has with its charter authorizer. Provided further, however, that any school identified as of June 30, 2018 as a\npriority or focus school pursuant to section\n100.18\nof this Part shall implement\na school comprehensive education plan in the 2018-2019 school year that meets\nthe requirements for such plan as specified in section\n100.18\nof this Part. Provided\nfurther that any school required to offer public school choice prior to July 1, 2018 pursuant to section\n100.18\nof this Part shall continue\nto permit any students to remain in the school to which they have transferred\nand provide transportation until such students have completed the highest grade\nlevel in the school to which such students have transferred, in the manner\nrequired by the provisions of section\n120.3\nof this Part. (1)\n\nInterventions for CSI Schools. (i) In the first school year in which the\nschool is identified as a CSI school, the school must: (a) participate in a comprehensive needs\nassessment conducted in accordance with subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (4) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section: (b) develop, in consultation with parents, school staff, and other stakeholders pursuant to section\n100.11\nof this Part, a school\ncomprehensive education plan as defined in subparagraph (viii) of paragraph (4)\nof subdivision (b) of this section. Such plan shall: (1)\nbe formally approved by the board of\neducation (in New York City, approved by the chancellor or chancellor's\ndesignee) and submitted for approval to the Commissioner by July 1 of the\nschool year in which the plan is required to be implemented: (2)\nbe implemented no later than the first\nday of regular student attendance of the next school year after the school year\nin which the school was identified: (3)\nbe updated annually and incorporate the\nfindings of the comprehensive needs assessment or progress needs assessment as\napplicable, and be implemented no later than the first day of regular student\nattendance of each year that the school remains a CSI school: (4)\nbe made widely available through public\nmeans by either posting on the district's or school's website, if one exists, or displayed conspicuously within the school, according to such timeline as may\nbe prescribed by the Commissioner: (5)\nbe developed in consultation with\nparents, school staff, and others pursuant to section\n100.11\nof this Part: and\n(6)\ninclude a description of the goals, targets, and activities, and include timelines for the implementation of\nschool-level evidence-based interventions and job-embedded professional\ndevelopment as defined in subparagraphs (v) and (ix) and of paragraph (4) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (c) limit incoming teachers transfers to\nteachers rated effective or highly effective pursuant to Education Law 3012-d\nby a school district in the previous school year, subject to collective\nbargaining as required under article 14 of the Civil Service Law, and require\nthat any successor collective bargaining agreement authorize such transfers\nunless otherwise prohibited by law: (d) establish a participatory budgeting\nprocess as defined in subparagraph (x) subparagraph (4) of subdivision (b) of\nthis section or provide opportunities for parent and student engagement in a\nmanner prescribed by the Commissioner: (e) conduct parent, staff, and student\nsurveys as defined in subparagraph (xi) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of\nthis section: and\n(f) notify\nparents and the public of the school's designation as a CSI school in\naccordance with subdivision (i) of this section. (ii)\n\nIn the second school year of\nidentification as a CSI school: (a) except as\notherwise provided in this subparagraph, the school shall continue to implement\nthe requirements established by subparagraph (i) of this subdivision, including\nthe school comprehensive education plan: (b) obtain prior approval of the Commissioner\nfor any significant modification to the school's approved comprehensive\neducation plan: (c) the principal\nmust submit to the district on a quarterly basis a report of the leading\nindicators identified in the comprehensive education plan detailing the\nprogress made toward meeting the goals set forth in the school's comprehensive\neducation plan: (d) any CSI school\nthat has met or exceeded its Annual Achievement Progression targets, as defined\nin paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of this section, in the first set of\navailable annual assessment data following the school's identification will\nreceive a progress needs assessment, which will inform the development of\nand/or any amendments or modifications to the school comprehensive education\nplan to be implemented in the following school year: (e) Any CSI school that has not met or\nexceeded its Annual Achievement Progression targets, as defined in paragraph\n(4) of subdivision (a) of this section, in the first set of available annual\nassessment data following the school's identification, will receive either a\nprogress needs assessment or a comprehensive needs assessment, as determined by\nthe Commissioner and based on the needs of the school as exhibited by the most\nrecent performance on the accountability measures. In addition to the needs\nassessment, as determined by the Commissioner, the district shall also submit a\nprincipal support report, as defined in subparagraph (xii) of paragraph (4) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section: (iii)\n\nIn the third school year of\nidentification as a CSI school: (a) except as\notherwise provided in this subparagraph, the school must continue to implement\nthe requirements established by subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, including\nthe school comprehensive education plan: (b) the principal must continue to submit to\nthe district on a quarterly basis a report of the leading indicators identified\nin the comprehensive needs assessment detailing the progress made toward\nmeeting the goals set forth in the school comprehensive education\nplan: (c) Any CSI school that has\nmet or exceeded its Annual Achievement Progression targets, as defined in\nparagraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section, in both the first set of\navailable annual assessment data following the school's identification and the\nsecond set of available data following identification, will receive a progress\nneeds assessment, which will inform the development of and/or any modifications\nto the school comprehensive education plan to be implemented in the following\nschool year. Provided that, if such school makes sufficient progress to be\nremoved from the accountability designation as set forth in subdivision (i) of\nthis section, such school shall be removed from the designation as a CSI\nschool: (d) Any CSI school that did\nnot meet or exceed its Annual Achievement Progression targets as defined in\nparagraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section, based on the first set of\navailable annual assessment data following the school's identification, but did\nmeet, or exceeded, its Annual Achievement Progression targets based on the\nsecond set of available annual assessment data, will receive either a progress\nneeds assessment, which will inform the development of the comprehensive\neducation plan to be implemented in the following school year. (e) Any CSI that did not meet or exceed its\n\nAnnual Achievement Progression target in the first and second set of available\nassessment data following the release of accountability determinations will\nreceive a progress needs assessment or comprehensive needs assessment, as\ndetermined by the Commissioner and based on the needs of the school as\nexhibited by the most recent performance on the accountability measures. Provided that, if a progress needs assessment was conducted in previous year of\nidentification, a comprehensive needs assessment must be completed. Any CSI\nschool that did not meet its Annual Achievement Progression target in the first\nand second set of available assessment data following the release of\naccountability determinations will also be required to amend the current year's\ncomprehensive education plan, and submit such amendment for the Commissioner's\napproval, within 60 days of the release of the school's Annual Achievement\n\nProgression results to identify how the school will partner with a BOCES, Regional Bilingual Educational Resource Network, Teacher Center, or other\n\nRegional Technical Assistance Center, or other technical assistance provider as\ndetermined by the Commissioner to support the implementation of its\ncomprehensive education plan. Additionally, a Principal Needs Assessment, as\ndefined in subparagraph (xiii) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of this\nsection, will be added to the District Needs Assessment process for any\ndistrict with a CSI school that does not reach its Annual Achievement\n\nProgression targets for two consecutive years: and\n(f) Any CSI school that met, or exceeded, its\n\nAnnual Achievement Progression target as defined in paragraph (4) of\nsubdivision (a) of this section, based on the first set of available annual\nassessment data following the school's identification, but did not meet its\n\nAnnual Achievement Progression target based on the second set of available\nannual assessment data, will receive either a progress needs assessment or a\ncomprehensive needs assessment, as determined by the Commissioner and based on\nthe needs of the school as exhibited by the most recent performance on the\naccountability measures. In addition to the needs assessment, as determined by\nthe Commissioner the district shall also submit a principal support report, as\ndefined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of this section. (g) In any CSI school that has a decline in\nits Core Subject Performance Index for elementary/middle schools or its\n\nComposite Performance Index for high schools for the all students subgroup, as\ndetermined by the Commissioner, for two consecutive years, the school district\nmust provide all students enrolled in the school with public school choice in\naccordance with section\n120.1\nand paragraph (4) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section. Provided further that, in instances when there\nare no schools in Good Standing or TSI schools serving the grade levels served\nby the CSI school that is required to provide public school choice, the\ndistrict shall ensure that the CSI school expends for Participatory Budgeting\nan amount equal to or greater than three times the amount expended by such\nschool during the first year in which such school implemented Participatory\n\nBudgeting. The tripling of the amount to expend is considered to be a one-time\naction, and the school will be required to expend the resulting amount each\nyear until it is no longer a CSI school (e.g., if district spent $2,000 in Year\n1, such amount is tripled to $6,000 in Year 2, and the district must spend\n$6,000 in Year 3 and each year thereafter until it is no longer a CSI school). In instances when there are schools within the school district that are in Good\n\nStanding or TSI but the district is unable to fulfill all of the public school\nchoice transfer requests submitted on behalf of students from the CSI school\nbecause there are not enough available seats to accommodate all transfer\nrequests received, then the district must ensure that the CSI school expends\nfor Participatory Budgeting an amount equal to or greater than at least two\ntimes the amount set aside at such school during the first year in which such\nschool implemented participatory budgeting. The doubling of the amount to\nexpend is considered to be a one time action, and the school will be required\nto expend the resulting amount each year until it is no longer a CSI school. Schools that are required to offer Public School Choice but were unable to do\nso and that instead fulfilled the annual participatory budgeting requirement\nidentified in this subdivision through increasing opportunities for parent and\nstudent engagement as prescribed by the Commissioner will be required to\nprovide additional opportunities for increased parent and student engagement in\na manner prescribed by the Commissioner. (iv)\n\nFor any CSI school that is required to\noffer public school choice or increase the amount expended for Participatory\n\nBudgeting as outlined in clause (g) of subparagraph (iii), that school shall\ncontinue to provide all students enrolled in the school with public school\nchoice during the period the school is identified as a CSI school. For schools\nthat were unable to offer to public school choice as outlined in clause (g) of\nsubparagraph (iii), and have fulfilled the annual participatory budgeting\nrequirement described in this subdivision through an alternate means of\nincreasing opportunities for parent and student engagement prescribed by the\n\nCommissioner will be required to continue to provide additional opportunities\nfor increased parent and student engagement as outlined in clause (g) of\nsubparagraph (iii) for each year the school is identified as a CSI school. If a school's designation as a CSI school is removed, the\nschool shall no longer be required to provide all students in the school with\npublic school choice in the following school year: provided further that any\nstudent receiving public school choice at the time the CSI designation is\nremoved, shall continue to be provided the opportunity to remain in the school\nto which they have transferred and be provided with transportation until the\nstudent has completed the highest grade level in the school to which such\nstudents have transferred, in the manner required by the provisions of section\n120.3\nof this\n\nPart. (v) Notwithstanding\nthe provisions of this paragraph, a school district, on behalf of a transfer\nhigh school that has been identified as a CSI school, may petition the\n\nCommissioner to differentiate the required interventions for such transfer high\nschool. Such petition may include, but need not be limited to, a request for\none or more of the following: (a) the school\ncomprehensive education plan shall be subject to approval only by the\ndistrict: (b) a transfer high\nschool shall not be required to offer public school choice: (c) a transfer high school shall not be\nrequired to amend its school comprehensive education plan to partner with a\nBOCES, Regional Bilingual Educational Resource Network, Teacher Center, or\nother Regional Technical Assistance Center or other technical assistance\nprovider as determined by the Commissioner to support the implementation of its\nschool comprehensive education plan.

(c) shall neither have been an employee of\nthe school district in the past two years, nor be engaged in any other work\nwith the school district while serving as an independent\nmonitor. (vii)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall forward to the Board of Regents a petition to register a new\nschool to replace a school under registration review or a persistently\nstruggling or struggling school only upon a finding by the Commissioner that\nthe school district has submitted a plan to create a new and satisfactory\neducational environment for students and has the capacity to implement\nsuccessfully such plan. (6)\n\nThe Commissioner may require a school\ndistrict to submit such reports and data as the Commissioner deems necessary to\nmonitor the implementation of the improvement plan, school comprehensive\neducation plan, or closure or phase out plan and to determine the degree to\nwhich the school has achieved the progress required by the Commissioner. Such\nreports shall be in a format and in accordance with such timeframe as are\nprescribed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may upon a finding of good\ncause extend the deadline for submission of a required plan. (7)\n\nIf the school has not taken the required\nactions to close or phase out a school as delineated by the Commissioner\npursuant to paragraphs (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this subdivision, the\n\nCommissioner shall recommend to the Board of Regents that the registration be\nrevoked and the school be declared an unsound educational environment, except\nthat the Commissioner may upon a finding of extenuating circumstances extend\nthe period during which the school must demonstrate progress. The board of\neducation of the school district which operates the school (in New York City, the chancellor or chancellor's designee) shall be afforded notice of such\nrecommendation and an opportunity to be heard in accordance with paragraph (9)\nof this subdivision. (8)\n\nUpon\napproval of revocation of registration by the Board of Regents, the\n\nCommissioner will develop a plan to ensure that the educational welfare of the\nstudents of the school is protected. Such plan shall specify the instructional\nprogram into which students who had attended the school will be placed, how\ntheir participation in the specified programs will be funded, and the measures\nthat will be taken to ensure that the selected placements appropriately meet\nthe educational needs of the students.

(ii)\n\nWithin 15 days of receiving notice of\nthe recommendation to revoke registration, the board of education (in New York\n\nCity, both the chancellor or chancellor's designee and any community school\nboard having jurisdiction over the school) may submit a written response to the\n\nCommissioner's recommendation. The response shall be in the form of a written\nstatement which presents the board of education's position, all evidence and\ninformation which the board of education believes is pertinent to the case, and\nlegal argument. If the board of education desires, it may include in its\nresponse a request for oral argument. Such response must be filed with the\n\nOffice of Counsel, New York State Education Department, State Education\n\nBuilding, Albany, NY 12234. (iii)\n\nWithin 30 days of the date of notice of the Commissioner's recommendation, a\npanel comprised of three members of the Board of Regents, appointed by the\nchancellor, shall convene to consider the Commissioner's recommendation, review\nany written response submitted by the board of education and, if timely\nrequested by the board of education, hear the oral argument. (m) Removal of schools\nfrom registration review, school phase-out or closure. (1)\n\nIn the event that a school has\ndemonstrated the progress necessary to be removed from registration review, the\nsuperintendent may petition the Commissioner to remove the school from\nregistration review. (2)\nA school\nshall not be removed from registration review if, in the Commissioner's\njudgment, conditions that may contribute to a poor learning environment, as\nidentified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (k) of this section, remain present\nin the school. (3)\n\nIn the event\nthat a school placed under registration review prior to the 2018-2019 school\nyear demonstrates that it has met its previously established progress targets\npursuant to paragraph (p) of section\n100.2\nor section\n100.18\nof this Part, but is\nidentified in the 2018-2019 school year as a CSI school pursuant to this\nsection, the school shall remain under registration review and shall follow the\nintervention requirements pursuant to subdivision (i) of this section and meet\nthe targets for removal from designation as a CSI school pursuant to\nsubdivision (i) of this section, pursuant to a timeline prescribed by the\n\nCommissioner. (4)\n\nIn the event that\na school placed under registration review prior to the 2018-2019 school year\ndemonstrates that it has met its previously established progress targets\npursuant to paragraph (p) of section\n100.2\nor section 100,19 of this\n\nPart, and is not identified in the 2018-2019 school year as a CSI school\npursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, the school shall be removed from\nregistration review. (5)\n\nIn the\nevent that a board of education either seeks to phase out or close a school\nunder registration review or is required to close or phase out a school\npursuant to paragraph (l)(3) of this section, the board of education (in New\n\nYork City, the chancellor or chancellor's designee) shall submit for\n\nCommissioner's approval, a plan identifying the intervention that will be\nimplemented and will result in phase out or closure, in the form and containing\nsuch content as prescribed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will consider\nthe academic impact of such phase out or closure on other schools within the\nschool district and may grant approval of such plan provided that: (i) official resolutions or other approvals\nto phase out or close the existing school have been adopted by the local board\nof education (in New York City, the chancellor or chancellor's\ndesignee): (ii)\na formal phase out\nor closure plan has been developed and approved in accordance with the\nrequirements of the intervention prescribed by the Commissioner pursuant to\nsubdivision (i) of this section: and\n(iii)\nparents, teachers, administrators, and\ncommunity members have been provided an opportunity to participate in the\ndevelopment of the phase out or closure plan. (n) Accountability system for schools and\ndistricts based on 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 school year results. (1)\n\nDefinitions.

For English Language Proficiency\n(ELP); Chronic Absenteeism (CA); and Graduation Rate, the minimum n size\napplies to the denominator used to calculate the rates. Provided, however, that\nwhere the Weighted Average Achievement Index student results for an\naccountability group are equal to or greater than 30, a Core Subject\n\nPerformance Index shall be computed for that accountability group so long as\nthere are a minimum of 15 student results for the Core Subject Performance\n\nIndex and the number of student results for the Core Subject Performance Index\nequals at least 50 percent of the number of results for the Weighted Average\n\nAchievement Index. Provided further that, where the Weighted Average\n\nAchievement Index student results for a high school accountability group are\nequal to or greater than 30, a graduation rate shall be computed for that\naccountability group so long as there are a minimum of 15 students in the\ngraduation cohort. (ii)\n\nAn\naccountability measure\nshall mean a measure used for the purpose of\nimplementing the system of accountability for schools and districts in\naccordance with the provisions of this section and shall include the following\nmeasures for elementary/middle schools: (1)\n\nWeighted Average Achievement Performance; (2)\n\nCore Subject Performance; (3)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency; and\n(4)\n\nChronic Absenteeism as\ndescribed in this subdivision.

The Commissioner shall also identify for CSI\nthose public elementary/middle schools that do not receive Title I funds that\nmeet the criteria used to identify Title I schools for CSI. Provided further\nthat a school that had been identified for CSI during the 2021-2022 school year\nthat does not meet the criteria for exiting CSI status pursuant to paragraph\n(5) of this subdivision shall remain identified for CSI. (b) For the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 school\nyears, the Commissioner shall not newly identify schools for CSI and will\nresume CSI identifications in the 2025-2026 school year based on 2024-2025\nschool year results. (iv)\n\nSchools identified for CSI (high schools). The State shall\ndesignate high schools for CSI using the following criteria: (a) for the 2022-2023 school year, using\n2021-2022 school year results, the Commissioner shall identify a minimum five\npercent of the lowest performing public high schools that receive Title I funds\nfor CSI and shall identify schools for CSI based upon the results from the all\nstudents subgroup based on the accountability measures described in this\nsubdivision. The Commissioner shall also identify for CSI those public high\nschools that do not receive Title I funds that meet the criteria used to\nidentify Title I schools for CSI. Any school with a 2017 Four-Year Graduation\n\nRate below 67 percent and a 2016 Five-Year or 2015 Six-Year Graduation Rate\nthat is not at or above 67 percent shall be preliminarily identified for CSI. Provided further that a school that had been identified for CSI during the\n2021-2022 school year that does not meet the criteria for exiting CSI status\npursuant to paragraph (5) of this subdivision shall remain identified for\nCSI. (b) For the 2023-2024 and\n2024-2025 school years, the Commissioner shall not newly identify schools for\nCSI and will resume CSI identifications in the 2025-2026 school year based on\n2024-2025 school year results. (v) Schools identified for targeted\nsupport and improvement\n(TSI)\n(elementary, middle, and high\nschools)\nshall mean a school with one or more consistently\nunderperforming accountability subgroups based on the accountability measures\ndescribed in this subdivision. In addition, a school identified for TSI based\nupon 2018-2019 school year results with any accountability subgroup that meets\nthe same scenario criteria used to identify schools for CSI pursuant to\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision based upon 2021-2022 school year results and\nthat failed to meet the modified criteria for exiting identification status in\nthis subdivision shall be identified for additional targeted support and\nimprovement (ATSI). Schools identified for TSI based upon 2017-2018 school year\nresults for which the identified subgroup(s) failed to meet the modified\ncriteria for exiting ATSI status in this subdivision based on 2021-2022 school\nyear results shall remain identified for ATSI. (a) For the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 school\nyears, the Commissioner shall not identify schools for ATSI, and will resume\nATSI identifications in the 2025-2026 school year based on 2024-2025 school\nyear results. (vi)\n\nTarget District\nshall mean any school district with one or\nmore schools identified for CSI, ATSI, or TSI. A\nTarget\n\nDistrict\nshall also mean any district whose district-wide performance\nlevels would cause a subgroup to meet the scenario in the decision table to be\nidentified for CSI, ATSI or TSI pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection. (vii)\n\nFor high school\nstudents, participation rate\nshall mean the percentage of\nstudents in grade 12 during the reporting year who have a valid score on an\napproved high school assessment.

(1)\n\nWeighted Average\n\nAchievement Level. For each public elementary/middle school whose all students\nsubgroup meets the minimum n-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision: (i) for the 2021-2022 school\nyear results, a Weighted Average Achievement Level using the results of ELA and\nmathematics assessments in grades 3-8 and science assessments for grades 4 and\n8 shall be computed by the Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (ii)\nfor the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school\nyear results, a Weighted Average Achievement Level using the results of ELA and\nmathematics assessments in grades 3-8 shall be computed by the\n\nCommissioner. (2)\n\nCore\n\nSubject Performance Level. For each public elementary/middle school whose all\nstudents subgroup meets the minimum n-size requirements as defined in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision, a Core Subject Performance Level using the results of\nELA and mathematics assessments in grades 3-8 and science assessments for\ngrades 4 and 8 shall be computed by the Commissioner in accordance with the\nprovisions of subdivision (f) of this section.

If the identification\nof schools in Scenario 1 results in fewer than five percent of public\nelementary/middle schools in the state that receive Title I funds being\nidentified for CSI, the Commissioner shall then determine which schools in\n\nScenario 2 shall be identified for CSI. The Commissioner shall continue to make\ndeterminations regarding which schools shall be identified for CSI in\ndescending scenario number order until a minimum of five percent of public\nelementary/middle schools that receive Title I funds shall be identified. Once\na minimum of five percent of public elementary/middle schools that receive\n\nTitle I funds have been identified, schools in a higher numbered scenario shall\nbe removed from preliminary identification. (c) In the 2023-2024 school year based on\n2022-2023 school year results and in the 2024-2025 school year based on\n2023-2024 school year results, a threshold on the decision table shall be\ndetermined by progressing through the scenarios until a minimum of five percent\nof the lowest performing elementary/middle schools meet the criteria for\nidentification to determine the list of schools that meet exit criteria in\naccordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this subdivision. The\n\nCommissioner shall not identify schools for CSI at the elementary/middle level\nin the 2023-2024 school year based on 2022-2023 school year results or in the\n2024-2025 school year based on 2023-2024 school year\nresults. (ii)\n\nIdentification of Elementary/Middle Schools for Targeted Support and\n\nImprovement (TSI). An elementary/middle school shall be preliminarily\nidentified for TSI if an accountability subgroup met the criteria for\nidentification for two consecutive years between the 2021-2022 and 2023-2024\nschool years and that same subgroup meets a scenario using the decision table\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, provided that only Scenario 1 and any\nother scenarios with numbers that are lower than the highest numbered scenario\nfor which a school was identified for CSI shall be used to identify schools for\nTSI. (a) For the identification of schools\nfor TSI based on 2021-2022 school year results, the consecutive years will be\nbased on 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school year results. (b) The designations of schools for TSI shall\nbe based on the performance of accountability subgroups, as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section and shall not include the\nperformance of the all students subgroup; provided that, in order to be\npreliminarily identified using the decision table in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Weighted\n\nAverage Achievement measure and one or more of the following measures: Core\n\nSubject Performance, English Language Proficiency, and/or Chronic\n\nAbsenteeism. (iii)\n\nIdentification of elementary/middle schools for Additional Targeted Support and\n\nImprovement (ATSI). (a) The Commissioner\nshall identify for ATSI any school identified for TSI in the 2019-2020 school\nyear based upon 2018-2019 school year results for which the same subgroup meets\nthe same scenario criteria used to identify schools for CSI pursuant to\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision and that failed to meet the modified criteria\nfor exiting identification status pursuant to paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision. (b) Notwithstanding\nclause (a) of this subparagraph, schools identified for TSI based on 2017-2018\nschool year results for which the identified subgroup(s) failed to meet the\nmodified criteria for exiting ATSI status in this subdivision based on 2021-\n2022 school year results shall remain identified for ATSI. (c) The Commissioner shall not identify\nelementary/middle schools for ATSI in the 2023-2024 school year based on\n2022-2023 school year results or in the 2024-2025 school years based on\n2023-2024 school year results. (3)\n\nAccountability system for high schools. (i) Identification of high schools for CSI. (a) A high school shall be preliminarily\nidentified for CSI using the following decision table, which combines multiple\nmeasures of performance for the all students subgroup in the school, as defined\nin paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, using the following\naccountability measures: (1)\n\nWeighted Average\n\nAchievement Performance; (2)\n\nGraduation Rate; (3)\n\nCore Subject\n\nPerformance\n(4)\n\nEnglish Language\n\nProficiency; and\n(5)\n\nChronic\n\nAbsenteeism; provided that in order to be preliminarily identified using the\ndecision table below a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the\n\nWeighted Average Achievement Performance and Graduation Rate measures and one\nor more of the following measures: Core Subject Performance, English Language\n\nProficiency, and/or Chronic Absenteeism. A school shall be preliminarily\nidentified for CSI if one or more of the scenarios in the decision table is\napplicable to the school. Provided, however, that notwithstanding the table\nbelow, any public high school with a 2017 Four-Year Graduation Rate below 67\npercent and a 2016 Five-Year or 2015 Six-Year Graduation Rate that is not at or\nabove 67 percent will be preliminarily identified for CSI.

(1)\n\nWeighted Average\n\nAchievement Level. For each public high school whose all students subgroup\nmeets the minimum n-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section: (i) For the\n2021-2022 school year results, a Weighted Average Achievement Level shall be\ncomputed by the Commissioner in the same manner as the Composite Performance\n\nLevel is assigned in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (f) of this\nsection. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subclause, Weighted Average\n\nAchievement Index shall not include students whose only assessment record for a\nsubject was an exemption from the 2019 - 2020 school year spring administration\nfor a Regents examination or approved alternative pursuant to section\n100.5\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Part. Provided further that Weighted Average Achievement shall also not\ninclude students whose only assessment record was an exemption for a subject\nfrom the 2019 - 2020 school year spring administration for the NYSAA. (ii)\n\nFor the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school\nyear results, a Weighted Average Achievement Index using only the results of\nELA, mathematics, and science assessments shall be computed by the\n\nCommissioner. The State assessments that may be used at the high school level\nare New York State Regents examinations in ELA, mathematics, and science, approved alternatives to Regents examinations in ELA, mathematics, and science, and the New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) for eligible students with\ndisabilities at the secondary level. (2)\n\nCore Subject Performance Level. For each\npublic high school whose all students subgroup meets the minimum n-size\nrequirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section: (i) for the 2021-2022 school year results, a\n\nCore Subject Performance Level shall be assigned by the Commissioner using the\nsame methodology used to assign a Weighted Average Achievement Level, except\nthat the denominator for computing the Core Subject Performance Index in each\nsubject shall be the members of the accountability cohort who have a valid\nscore on an accountability assessment in the subject. (ii)\nfor the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school\nyear results, a Core Subject Performance Level using only the results of ELA, mathematics, and science assessments shall be computed by the Commissioner. The\n\nState assessments that may be used at the high school level are New York State\n\nRegents examinations in ELA, mathematics, and science, approved alternatives to\n\nRegents examinations in ELA, mathematics, and science, and the New York State\n\nAlternate Assessment (NYSAA) for eligible students with disabilities at the\nsecondary level. (3)\n\nGraduation Rate. For each public high school whose all students subgroup meets\nthe minimum n-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b)\nof this section, a Graduation Rate Level shall be assigned by the Commissioner. (i) The Commissioner shall first compute the\nschool's 2017 four-year, 2016 five-year, and 2015 six-year Graduation Rates, in\naccordance with subdivision (f) of this section. (ii)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then rank order\nschools based on the unweighted average of the four-year, five-year, and\nsix-year Graduation Rates. (iii)\n\nEach high school shall then be assigned a Graduation Rate Level from 14 based\non such rank ordering using the table below: Graduation Rate Rank\n\nGraduation Rate Level\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency Level. For\neach public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirements as defined in\nparagraph (1) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute an English\n\nLanguage Proficiency Level in accordance with subdivision (f) of this\nsection: (5)\n\nChronic Absenteeism\n\nLevel. For each public high school whose all students subgroup meets the\nminimum n-size requirement pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the\n\nCommissioner shall compute a Chronic Absenteeism Level as follows: (i) The Commissioner shall first compute the\nschool's Chronic Absenteeism Rate, in accordance with subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nThe Commissioner\nshall then rank order schools based on their Chronic Absenteeism rate in\ndescending order. (iii)\n\nEach high\nschool will then be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level from 1-4 based on such\nrank ordering using the table below: Chronic Absenteeism\n\nRank\n\nChronic Absenteeism\n\nLevel\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(b) The Commissioner shall first determine\nwhich schools in Scenario 1 shall be identified for CSI. If the identification\nof schools in Scenario 1 results in fewer than five percent of public high\nschools in the state that receive Title I funds being identified for CSI, the\n\nCommissioner shall then determine which schools in Scenario 2 shall be\nidentified for CSI. The Commissioner shall continue to make determinations\nregarding which schools shall be identified for CSI in descending scenario\nnumber order until a minimum of five percent of public high schools that\nreceive Title I funds shall be identified. Once a minimum of five percent of\npublic high schools that receive Title I funds have been identified, schools in\na higher numbered scenario shall be removed from preliminary\nidentification. (c) In the\n2023-2024 school year based on 2022-2023 school year results and in the\n2024-2025 school year based on 2023-2024 school year results, a threshold on\nthe scenario tables shall be determined by progressing through the scenarios\nuntil a minimum of five percent of the lowest performing high schools meet the\ncriteria for identification to determine the list of schools that meet exit\ncriteria in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision. The Commissioner shall not identify schools for CSI in the\n2023-2024 and the 2024-2025 school years. (ii)\n\nIdentification of high schools for TSI. (a) A high school shall be preliminarily\nidentified for TSI if an accountability subgroup met the criteria for\nidentification for two consecutive years between the 2021-2022 and 2023-2024\nschool years and that same subgroup meets a scenario using the decision table\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, provided that only Scenario 1 and any\nother scenarios with numbers that are lower than the highest numbered scenario\nfor which a school was identified for CSI shall be used to identify schools for\nTSI. (b) For the identification of\nschools for TSI based on 2021-2022 school year results, the consecutive years\nwill be 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school year results. (c) The designation of schools for TSI shall\nbe based on the performance of accountability subgroups, as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section and shall not include the\nperformance of the all students subgroup; provided that, in order to be\npreliminarily identified using the decision table in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Weighted\n\nAverage Achievement measure and Graduation Rate measures and one or more of the\nfollowing measures: Core Subject Performance, English Language Proficiency, and/or Chronic Absenteeism. (iii)\n\nIdentification of high schools for\nATSI. (a) The Commissioner shall identify for\nATSI any school identified for TSI in the 2019 - 2020 school year based upon\n2018 - 2019 school year results for which the identified subgroup meets the\nsame scenario criteria used to identify schools for CSI pursuant to paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision and that failed to meet the modified criteria for\nexiting identification status pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subdivision. The Commissioner shall not identify schools for ATSI at the high school level\nin the 2023- 2024 school year based on 2022-2023 school year results and the\n2024-2025 school year based on 2023-2024 school year results. (b) Notwithstanding clause (a) of this\nsubparagraph, schools identified for TSI based on 2017 - 2018 school year\nresults for which the identified subgroup(s) failed to meet the modified\ncriteria for exiting ATSI status based on 2021-2022 school year results shall\nremain identified for ATSI. (4)\n\nInterventions. Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of subdivision (i) of this section, interventions in schools\nidentified for CSI, ATSI, and TSI and interventions in Target Districts shall\nbe modified as follows: (i) Any school with\nany accountability measure of Level 1 for any subgroup, as calculated pursuant\nto subdivision (f) of this section, that is not a school identified for CSI, ATSI, or TSI, shall not require a needs assessment based on Level 1\nidentifications using 2021-2022, 2022-2023, or 2023-2024 school year\nresults. (ii)\n\nAnnual Achievement\n\nProgression target shall not be determined using results from the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, or 2023-2024 school year s for schools identified for CSI. (iii)\n\nParticipation rate self-assessments and\nparticipation rate improvement plans shall not be required for any school based\non 2021-2022, 2022-2023, or 2023-2024 school year results. (5)\n\nRemoval from accountability designation. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (j) of this section, the\n\nCommissioner shall use the following procedures to exit schools from\nidentification for CSI, ATSI, TSI, and from Target District status based on\n2021-2022, 2022-2023, or 2023-2024 school year results. (i) For elementary/middle schools: (a) For schools identified for CSI or ATSI, an increase between the school's performance in the 2021-2022 year compared to\nthe 2017-2018 school year, or the 2022-2023 year compared to the 2021-2022\nschool year, based on either the Core Subject Performance Index or the Weighted\n\nAverage Achievement Index for the identified subgroup. Provided, however, that\nan elementary/middle school may not exit CSI or ATSI status if the school is\nidentified for CSI or ATSI using 2021-2022 school year results or meets the CSI\nidentification criteria in the 2023-2024 school year based on 2022-2023 school\nyear results. (b) Beginning with the\n2023-2024 school year results, a school identified for CSI and ATSI may exit\nstatus if there is an increase in performance for two consecutive years on\neither the Core Subject Performance Index or the Weighted Average Achievement\n\nIndex. Provided, however, that an elementary/middle school may not exit CSI or\nATSI status if the school meets the criteria for identification as CSI or\nATSI. (c) For schools identified\nfor TSI, the school is not identified for TSI using the 2021-2022 or 2022-2023\nschool year results. (d) Beginning\nwith the 2023-2024 school year results, a school identified for TSI may exit\nstatus if the school does not meet the TSI criteria for two consecutive\nyears. (ii)\n\nFor high\nschools: (a) For schools identified for CSI\nor ATSI, an increase between the school's performance in the 2021-2022 school\nyear compared to the 2017-2018 school year, or the 2023-2024 year compared to\nthe 2021-2022 school year, based on the Weighted Average Achievement Index or\nthe unweighted average of the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation\n\nRates computed pursuant to clause (f)(2)(i)(b) of this section for the\nidentified subgroup. Provided, however, that a high school may not exit CSI or\nATSI status if the school is identified for CSI or ATSI using 2021-2022 school\nyear results or meets the CSI or ATSI identification criteria in the 2023-2024\nschool year based on 2022-2023 school year results. (b) Beginning with the 2023-2024 school year\nresults, a school identified for CSI and ATSI may exit status if there is an\nincrease in performance for two consecutive years on either the Weighted\n\nAverage Achievement Index or the Core Subject Performance Index, or if the\nunweighted average of the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rates\nis higher than the Graduation Rate at the time of identification for two\nconsecutive years. For schools identified for CSI for having Graduation Rate\nless than 67%, the school must have a Graduation Rate at or above 67% for two\nconsecutive years to exit CSI status. Provided, however, that a high school may\nnot exit CSI or ATSI status if the school meets the criteria for identification\nas CSI or ATSI. (c) For schools\nidentified for TSI, the school is not identified for TSI using the 2021-2022 or\n2022-2023 school year results. (d) Beginning with the 2023-2024 school year results, a school identified for TSI\nmay exit status if the school does not meet the TSI criteria for two\nconsecutive years.
