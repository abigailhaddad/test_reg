  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 247.12 - Financial need\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purpose. The agency's limited financial resources shall be allocated to maximize\nprovision of vocational rehabilitation services to those eligible individuals\nwith the greatest financial need. The determination of financial need shall be\nconsidered an integral part of the rehabilitation planning process for eligible\nindividuals receiving vocational rehabilitation services. (b) Eligible individuals exempt from\nfinancial need requirements. (1)\n\nThe\nfollowing individuals shall not be subject to a financial needs test: (i) public assistance recipients for whom\nverification of receipt of assistance has been received by the agency; and\n(ii)\npersons determined\neligible for Social Security benefits under title II or XVI of the Social\n\nSecurity Act. (2)\n\nIf an\neligible individual has been terminated from any of the programs listed in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the individual shall become subject to\nfinancial need requirements, unless he/she is made eligible for another of such\nprograms. (3)\n\nThe agency reserves\nthe right to waive the requirement of meeting financial need criteria, if the\nagency deems it to be in the best interests of an individual terminated from\nany of the programs in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, or for an individual\nwhose family resources increase following commencement of a program of service\nunder an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Program. (c) To the extent permitted by Federal law, all services will be subject to financial need requirements. Individuals will\nbe informed of those services subject to financial need at the time of program\nplanning, and other appropriate times. Services provided to individuals without regard to\nfinancial status are: (1)\nassessment\nfor determining eligibility and priority for services except those\nnon-assessment services that are provided to an individual with a significant\ndisability during either an exploration of the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations through the use of\ntrial work experiences or an extended evaluation; (2)\nassessment for determining vocational\nrehabilitation needs; (3)\nvocational rehabilitation counseling and guidance; (4)\nreferral and other services; (5)\njob-related services; (6)\npersonal assistance services; and\n(7)\nany auxiliary aid or\nservice such as interpreter services or reader services that an individual with\na disability requires under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act or the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act or regulations implementing those laws, in\norder for the individual to participate in the agency's program. (d) Computing individual's and\nagency's participation in service costs. (1)\n\nThe agency will establish levels of individual financial need to determine the\nextent of participation by the eligible individual in the cost of the\nvocational rehabilitation services. These levels will take into account the\ncurrent income and assets of the individual, the individual's spouse, and any\nother relative upon whom the individual is considered dependent. (2)\n\nThe agency's participation in the cost of\na vocational rehabilitation service will be limited by the maximum level of\nfunding established for such service pursuant to section\n247.14\nof this Part. (3)\n\nFinancial information submitted by each\neligible individual will be applied against the agency's financial need levels. The agency will establish and maintain written procedures for performing these\ndeterminations. These procedures will be available to each\nindividual. (4)\n\nThe financial need\nof all eligible individuals will be reviewed at least once a year. (e) Determination of dependency. (1)\n\nAn eligible individual under the age of\n22 will be presumed dependent upon his or her parents, or legal guardian, unless the individual can satisfactorily demonstrate that he or she would not\nbe considered dependent if the dependency test contained in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision were applied. (2)\n\nAn eligible individual of age 22 or older will be considered independent, unless in the most recent calendar year more than one half of the individual's\ntotal support was provided by a relative. (f) Submission of financial information. (1)\n\nEach eligible individual shall be\nrequired to report at least annually on income, assets, dependency status, and\nsimilar benefits available under other programs or insurance which might\nduplicate agency services. (2)\n\nThe\neligible individual shall also be required to report at least annually on the\nincome and assets of the individual's spouse and, if the individual is a\ndependent, on the income and assets of the relative upon whom the individual is\ndependent. (3)\n\nThe eligible\nindividual may be required to present documentation of all financial need\ninformation reported. (4)\n\nThe\neligible individual shall be required to report any changes in income, assets, dependency status, or similar benefits that would have an effect on the\nfinancial need determination. The agency will maintain written procedures for\nadjusting financial need determinations under such circumstances. (g) Refusal to provide financial\ninformation. (1)\n\nIn the event the eligible\nindividual or the individual's spouse, or the relative upon whom the individual\nis dependent, refuses to provide information or documentation required to\ndetermine financial need, the agency will withhold all services which are\ncontingent upon financial need, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision. (2)\n\nIn the\nevent that the individual upon whom the eligible individual is dependent\nrefuses to provide information or documentation required to determine financial\nneed, upon satisfactory demonstration of the individual's cooperation, the\nagency, at its discretion, may provide services contingent on financial\ndeterminations based solely on documented information provided by the\nindividual. (h) Refusal\nto assume responsibility for financial participation. (1)\n\nIf an eligible individual refuses to\ncontribute the share of service cost indicated by financial need computations, from resources within the control of the individual, then no service contingent\non financial need may be authorized. (2)\n\nIf the resources in question are\ncontrolled by another person who refuses to accept responsibility for the cost\nof services, the agency will determine whether the resources are actually\navailable to the eligible individual or whether they may be excluded from\nfinancial need computations. Considerations in this determination shall\ninclude: (i) the nature of the individual's\nrelationship with the individual who controls the resources; (ii)\nthe probable effect on the individual's\nsituation of continuing to include such resources in financial need\ncomputations; and\n(iii)\nthe\nlong-term public interest, if there is a probability that the withholding of\nvocational rehabilitation services will result in the individual becoming or\nremaining on public assistance.
