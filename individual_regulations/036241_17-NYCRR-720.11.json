  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 720.11 - Out-of-service and defect criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The condition of\nvehicles subject to inspection by the department will be evaluated at the time\nof inspection on the basis of applicable requirements of this Part, the\n\nTransportation and Vehicle and Traffic Laws of the State of New York, applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards and the criteria contained in\nthis section. Vehicles that do not meet the applicable requirements shall be\nplaced \"out-of-service\", or repaired in a timely manner in accordance with this\nsection. (b) Applicability. These\ncriteria apply to all vehicles subject to inspection by this department. The\napplicability of each inspection item listed is based on the type, size, and\nuse of the vehicle. Therefore, all inspection vehicle items will not apply to\nall vehicles. As an example, a vehicle not equipped with air brakes will not\nhave the air brake criteria applied to that vehicle. (c) The department may elect to inspect only\ncertain vehicle components based on the overall safety performance of the\noperator. (d) Criteria. (1)\n\nAny vehicle with at least one Defect\n\nRating of \"A\" discovered at the time of inspection shall be issued an\n\"out-of-service vehicle\" sticker, and that vehicle may not be used to carry\npassengers until the defect(s) has been repaired/corrected and the vehicle has\nbeen re-inspected by a NYSDOT inspector, the \"out-of-service vehicle\" sticker\nremoved by the inspector and a valid inspection certificate affixed. (2)\n\nAny vehicle operated by a carrier with an\nacceptable safety and inspection record that is without a Defect Rating of \"A\"\ndiscovered at the time of inspection shall be issued an inspection certificate\nbased on the following conditions: (i) If the\nvehicle has one or more Defect Ratings of \"B,\" such defect(s) must be repaired\nby the carrier prior to carrying any passengers. (ii)\n\nIf the vehicle has any one or more\n\nDefect Ratings of \"C,\" such defect(s) must be repaired by the carrier within 15\ndays of the date of inspection. (3)\n\nVehicles operated by a carrier determined\nnot to have an acceptable safety and inspection record that have Defect Ratings\nof \"B'' and \"C'' shall be treated as if they had a Defect Rating of \"A''. Periodically, the Office of Modal Safety & Security shall determine those\ncarriers that do not have an adequate safety and inspection record. Such\ndeterminations may be based on a review of the carrier's past safety record, preventive maintenance program and out-of-service rate. (4)\n\nEffective April 1, 1998 pursuant to\nchapter 202 of the Laws of 1997, historic double-decker buses operating\npursuant to the regulatory authority of the New York City Office of Consumer\n\nAffairs and meeting the definition contained in section\n720.1\n(m) of this\n\nPart shall comply with each of the \"Out-of-Service and Defect Criteria\" except\nas follows: 12.00, 15.01, 18.04.2 (providing the vehicle has aisles at least 10\ninch wide and 72 inches high), 20.00.2, 21.00, 25.01, 37.00.2 and 45.05.
