One member designated managerial will be\nappointed by the agency head or his/her designee, one member will be appointed\nby the President of District Council 37 or his/her designee, and the third\nmember will be appointed jointly by both parties from a list of mutually\nacceptable employees within the agency who are eligible to serve on the\nboard. (3)\n\nThe agency review board\nwill review the employee's request and make a recommendation to the agency\nhead, or his/her designee, who will make the final decision in the agency with\nrespect to the employee's request. A board member who participated in the\ndevelopment of an employee's evaluation report shall not participate in the\nreview of the employee's request, nor shall an agency head, or his/her\ndesignee, who may be responsible for the final decision in the agency\nconcerning the employee's evaluation, participate in deliberations of the\nagency review board. (b) Statewide review board. The statewide performance evaluation review board is a\nthree-member panel established for the purpose of reviewing determinations of\nthe agency head or his/her designee in instances where an employee's\nperformance continues to be summarized as unsatisfactory or an equivalent\nrating and the employee requests a review of that decision. One member is\nappointed by the President of District Council 37 or his designee, one member\nis appointed by the Director of the Governor's Office of Employee Relations or\nhis designee, and a third member, appointed by mutual agreement of the\n\nPresident of District Council 37 and the Director of the Governor's Office of\n\nEmployee Relations or their designees. (c) General procedures. (1)\n\nEligibility. Employees who are not on\nprobation and who are rated unsatisfactory or an equivalent rating may seek to\nraise their summary rating through the review process. (2)\n\nSubject of review. Employees may use the\nreview process only to request a review of their summary rating. Disputes of\nsuch issues as the individual performance program and the rating and review\nprocess are not reviewable. Also, ratings of other than an unsatisfactory or\nequivalent rating and dollar amounts of performance advances are not subject to\nreview. (3)\n\nTiming. (i) Employees have 15 calendar days from\nreceipt of their summary rating in which to submit a request for\nreview. (ii)\n\nEmployees whose\nunsatisfactory or equivalent rating is sustained at the agency level will have\n15 calendar days from receipt of the decision of the agency head or his/her\ndesignee to submit a further request to the statewide performance evaluation\nreview board.
