(1)\n\nThe Grand Slam requires selection of the\nofficial first-, second- or third-place finisher in each of the first three\nraces in a series of four designated Grand Slam races. A completed winning\n\nGrand Slam wager requires the selection of the official first place finisher in\nthe fourth and final event in this same series of races. The Grand Slam wager\nis classified as an exotic bet and is subject to the prevailing exotic takeout\nrate set forth in sections 236 and 238 of the Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and\n\nBreeding Law. (2)\n\nThe Grand Slam\npool shall be apportioned under the following method: Grand Slam Wager with no\ncarryover.

(ii)\n\nIf there are no winning wagers taking\ninto account all four segments of the Grand Slam wager, the pool shall be\ndistributed as a single price pool to those who selected the first place\nfinisher in the fourth and final Grand Slam event in this series of races along\nwith the greatest number of first, second or third-place finishes each of which\nhad an accompanying show pari-mutuel payout, in accordance with section\n4009.22\nof this Title, in each of\nthe first three races in the series of four designated Grand Slam races. All\nresults are based upon the official order of finish for each race.

(4)\n\nIf there is a dead heat for second and/or\nthird in any of the first three races in a series of four designated Grand Slam\ncontests involving: (i) horses representing\nthe same betting interest, the Grand Slam pool shall be distributed as if no\ndead heat occurred; (ii)\nhorses\nrepresenting two or more betting interests, the Grand Slam pool shall be\ndistributed from a single betting pool with a winning wager including the\nbetting interest that finished first or any betting interest involved in the\ndead heat for second or third providing the horse has a show pari-mutuel\npayout.

The totalisator shall produce reports showing each of\nthe wagering combinations with substituted betting interests which became\nwinners as a result of the substitution, in addition to the normal winning\ncombination; (ii)\nshould a scratch\nor scratches occur in any of the first three races in a series of four\ndesignated Grand Slam contests and subsequently show wagering is cancelled due\nto an insufficient number of remaining betting interests, this race for winning\n\nGrand Slam wagering purposes would include the win and place horse\nonly.
