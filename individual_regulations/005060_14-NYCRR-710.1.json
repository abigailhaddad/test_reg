  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 710.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of\nthis Part is to set forth uniform procedures for the surrogate decision-making\ncommittee established by article 80 of the Mental Hygiene Law (MHL). (b) Article 80 of the MHL requires the\n\nJustice Center to administer a statewide quasi-judicial process for patients in\nneed of surrogate decision-making as defined in section 80.03(b) of the MHL to\nassess: (1)\na patient's capacity to consent to\nor refuse major medical treatment, and\n(2)\nwhether there is an available and willing\nsurrogate to make the decisions, and\n(3)\nwhether the proposed treatment promotes\nthe patient's best interests. Article 80 of the MHL authorizes panels organized by the\nsurrogate decision-making committee to consider proposed major medical\ntreatments on behalf of qualifying patients. (c) Article 17-A of the SCPA authorizes\npanels organized by the surrogate decision-making committee to consider\nproposed end-of-life decisions on behalf of qualifying patients. Section\n1750-b of the SCPA requires the Justice Center to establish procedures to\nassess: (1)\na patient's capacity to consent\nto or refuse the withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining treatment, and\n(2)\nwhether the proposed\ndecision promotes the patient's best interests. (d) The surrogate decision-making committee\nprovides another means to obtain informed consent when a qualifying patient\nlacks decision-making capacity and has no surrogate decision maker willing or\nable to make the decision. This program is intended to serve as an alternative\nmeans to the court system for obtaining medical consent and will not prevent\napplications to a court to obtain consent in the absence of, or prior to a\nreview of the case, by a surrogate decision-making committee or panel. The\nprogram is available in all sixty-two counties of New York State. (e) The surrogate decision-making committee\norganizes volunteer panels to make determinations regarding proposed major\nmedical treatments for qualifying patients, including the capacity of the\nqualifying patient to make such a decision, the availability and willingness of\nan alternative surrogate decision maker, and the best interests of the\nqualifying patient. The Justice Center determines the staff and assistance\navailable to the SDMC program. In providing such staff and assistance, the\n\nJustice Center may enter into agreements with not-for-profit organizations\nincluding but not limited to community dispute resolution centers, as defined\nby article 21-A of the Judiciary Law. Staff of such organizations shall be\nconsidered public officers for the purposes of sections\n17, 19\nand\n74\nof the\n\nPublic Officers Law (POL). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
