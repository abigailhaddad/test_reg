  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1200.3.8 - Special responsibilities of prosecutors and other government lawyers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A prosecutor or other government lawyer shall not institute, cause to be\ninstituted or maintain a criminal charge when the prosecutor or other\ngovernment lawyer knows or it is obvious that the charge is not supported by\nprobable cause. (b) A prosecutor or other government lawyer in criminal litigation shall make\ntimely disclosure to counsel for the defendant or to a defendant who has no\ncounsel of the existence of evidence or information known to the prosecutor or\nother government lawyer that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate\nthe degree of the offense, or reduce the sentence, except when relieved of this\nresponsibility by a protective order of a tribunal. (c) When a prosecutor knows of\nnew, credible and material evidence creating a reasonable likelihood that a\nconvicted defendant did not commit an offense of which the defendant was\nconvicted, the prosecutor shall within a reasonable time: (1)\ndisclose that evidence to\nan appropriate court or prosecutor's office; or\n(2)\nif the conviction was\nobtained by that prosecutor's office; (i) notify the appropriate court and\nthe defendant that the prosecutor's office possesses such evidence unless a\ncourt authorizes delay for good cause shown; (ii)\ndisclose that evidence to the\ndefendant unless the disclosure would interfere with an ongoing investigation\nor endanger the safety of a witness or other person, and a court authorizes\ndelay for good cause shown; and\n(iii)\nundertake or make reasonable\nefforts to cause to be undertaken such further inquiry or investigation as may\nbe necessary to provide a reasonable belief that the conviction should or\nshould not be set aside. (d) When a prosecutor knows of\nclear and convincing evidence establishing that a defendant was convicted, in a\nprosecution by the prosecutor's office, of an offense that the defendant did\nnot commit, the prosecutor shall seek a remedy consistent with justice, applicable law, and the circumstances of the case. (e) A prosecutor's independent\njudgment, made in good faith, that the new evidence is not of such nature as to\ntrigger the obligations of sections (c) and (d), though subsequently determined\nto have been erroneous, does not constitute a violation of this rule.
