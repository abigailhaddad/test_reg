  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 451.3 - Calibration of measurement systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe sound level measurement system must\nbe calibrated and appropriately adjusted at one or more frequencies in the\nrange from 250 to 1,000 Hz at the beginning of each series of measurements and\nat intervals of five to 15 minutes thereafter, until it has been determined\nthat the sound level measurement system has not significantly drifted from its\ncalibrated level. Once this fact has been established, calibrations may be made\nat intervals once every hour. A significant drift shall be considered to have\noccurred if a 0.3 dB or more excursion is noted from the system's predetermined\nreference calibration level. In the case of systems using displays with whole\ndecibel increments, the operator may visually judge when the 0.3 dB drift has\nbeen met or exceeded. (2)\n\nThe sound\nlevel measurement system must be checked periodically by its manufacturer, a\nrepresentative of its manufacturer or a person of equivalent special\ncompetence, to verify that its accuracy meets the manufacturer's design\ncriteria. (b) An\nacoustical calibrator of the microphone coupler type designed for the sound\nlevel measurement system in use shall be used to calibrate the sound level\nmeasurement system in accordance with subdivision (a) of this section. The\ncalibration must meet or exceed the accuracy requirements specified in section\n5.4.1. of the American National Standards Institute standard, Methods for\n\nMeasurements of Sound Pressure Levels, ANSI S1.13-1971, for field method\nmeasurements. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n451.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
