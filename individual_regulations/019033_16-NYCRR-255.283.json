  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.283 - Plastic pipe: qualifying joining procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Heat fusion, solvent cement, and\nadhesive joints. Before any written procedure established under section\n255.273\n(b) of\nthis Part is used for making plastic pipe joints by a heat fusion, solvent\ncement, or adhesive method, the procedure must be qualified by subjecting\nspecimen joints that are made according to the procedure, to the following\ntests, as applicable: (1)\n\nThe test\nrequirements of: (i) in the case of\nthermoplastic pipe, the Sustained Pressure Test or the Minimum Hydrostatic\n\nBurst Pressure per the listed specification requirements. Additionally, for\nelectrofusion joints, based on the pipe material, the Tensile Strength Test or\nthe Joint Integrity Test per the listed specification; (ii)\nin the case of thermosetting plastic\npipe, paragraph 8.5 (Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Pressure) or paragraph 8.9\n(Sustained Static Pressure Test) of ASTM Specification D2517 (as described in\nsection\n10.3\nof this Title); (iii)\nin the case of electrofusion fittings\nfor polyethylene (PE) pipe and tubing, paragraph 9.1 (Minimum Hydraulic Burst\n\nPressure Test), paragraph 9.2 (Sustained Pressure Test), paragraph 9.3 (Tensile\n\nStrength Test), or paragraph 9.4 (Joint Integrity Tests) of ASTM F1055 (as\ndescribed in section\n10.3\nof this\n\nTitle). (2)\n\nFor\nprocedures intended for lateral pipe connections, subject a specimen joint made\nfrom pipe sections joined at right angles according to the procedure to a force\non the lateral pipe until failure occurs in the specimen. If failure initiates\noutside the joint area, the procedure qualifies for use. (3)\n\nFor procedures intended for non-lateral\npipe connections, perform tensile testing in accordance with a listed\nspecification. If the specimen elongates no less than 25% or failure initiates\noutside the joint area, the procedure qualifies for use. (b) Before any written procedure established\nunder section\n255.273\n(b) of\nthis Part is used for making mechanical plastic pipe joints the procedure must\nbe qualified in accordance with a listed specification based upon a pipe\nmaterial. (c) A copy of each\nwritten procedure being used for joining plastic pipe must be available to the\npersons making and inspecting joints. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
