  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 2200.6 - Effect of the presumptive release determination\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any inmate who is granted a presumptive\nmerit allowance may be released to parole supervision at a date computed by\nsubtracting the merit time allowance from his or her parole eligibility\ndate. (b) Any inmate who is granted\na presumptive initial earned eligibility certificate may be released to parole\nsupervision at the expiration of the minimum sentence. (c) If presumptive merit allowance is denied\nby the commissioner or designee, either due to the nature and circumstances of\nthe crime, or due to the inmate's prior history, character or background, or\ndue to one or more questions raised in the inmate's file, such denial\nrepresents a determination that the parole release decision can best be made\nfollowing the individual's appearance before the Board of Parole. Therefore, the inmate will not be eligible for presumptive release consideration at any\nsubsequent time. The presumptive release denial is not an indiction one way or\nthe other as to the inmate's suitability for possible release on\nparole. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n2200.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
