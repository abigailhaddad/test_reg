  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1902.1 - Rent and occupancy requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Legal occupants of a project at the time\nof the award of a payment, grant or loan hereunder who remain in possession\nduring construction, rehabilitation or conversion shall be entitled to continue\nin possession subsequent to construction, rehabilitation or conversion. Also, legal occupants at the time of the award of a payment, grant or loan hereunder\nwho are temporarily relocated during construction, rehabilitation or conversion\nshall not be permanently displaced. (b) All additional occupants subsequent to\nrehabilitation or conversion shall be persons of low income at the time they\nmake application for the unit. (c) Any person applying for a unit in a project subject to these regulations shall\nsubmit to the project owner, the owner's agent or the owner's assignee, a copy\nof the most recent New York State or Federal income tax return or an affidavit\ncertifying the prior year's income, along with the application for a\nunit; (d) In selecting among\neligible applicants for occupancy of projects subject to these regulations, the\nowner shall give preference to: (1)\npersons\nor families with the lowest incomes possible given the income requirements of\nthe project; and\n(2)\npersons or\nfamilies whose current housing fails to meet basic standards of health and\nsafety and who have little prospect of improving the condition of their housing\nexcept by residing in a project assisted pursuant to the act. (e) Written leases are required\nfor all tenants in a project assisted hereunder. Said lease must include a\nprovision that those tenants 60 years of age or older or tenants subject to a\ndisability as defined in New York State Executive Law, article 15, section 292, who have a lease for a rental unit in a project at the time the resale and\noccupancy restrictions end shall be permitted to renew their lease for the\nremainder of their occupancy at rents that will be affordable to them (total\nhousing costs that are less than 30 percent of the income limits as defined in\nsection\n1900.3\n[a][20] and\n[21]\nof this Title), except that the tenant\nmay be evicted for good cause in accordance with applicable laws and\nrules. (f) Each unit assisted\nhereunder shall be the principal residence of its occupant. (g) Relocation requirements are as follows: (1)\nlegal occupants of a project to be\nrehabilitated or constructed hereunder who are in possession on the date of\naward of the payment, grant or loan shall not be displaced as a result of such\nrehabilitation or construction, other than temporarily in order to allow for\nsuch rehabilitation or construction; (2)\nwhere rehabilitation or construction is\nlikely to create hazardous conditions for legal tenants, the project recipient\nor subrecipient must provide suitable arrangements approved by the corporation\nor the local program administrator, as the case may be, for temporary\nrelocation of all legal occupants affected by the rehabilitation or\nconstruction work for as long as such conditions exist. However, as soon as the\nhazardous conditions cease to exist, the owner must offer to return the legal\noccupant to the building, and at that time relocation costs cease to be an\neligible cost; (3)\nat its option, the project recipient, local program administrator or subrecipient may\nundertake to provide suitable arrangements approved by the corporation or local\nprogram administrator, as the case may be, for such period of time as it\napproves, for temporary relocation of all legal occupants in the project\naffected by the rehabilitation or construction work; (4)\neligible costs of relocating tenants\nshall include payment of reasonable moving expenses to and from the unit, and\nupon relocation, payment of the difference, if any, between the monthly housing\ncost of the relocation residence and the monthly housing cost of the former\nunit, or the difference between 30 percent of the income of the relocated\ntenant and the monthly housing cost of the relocation residence, whichever\ndifference results in a lower payment. (h) The project recipient, local program\nadministrator or subrecipient, subject to the approval of the corporation, shall establish a two tier system of rents. The first tier shall apply to\npersons of low income; the second shall apply to persons who do not qualify as\npersons of low income. Under the first tier, the rent (basic rent) shall not\nexceed 30 percent of the maximum income qualification for a person of low\nincome in the eligible area. Under the second tier, the rent (market rent)\nshall not exceed the lesser of 30 percent of the tenant's income or the basic\nrent plus an amount, as determined by the corporation, which would be payable\nwere all payments, grants and loans to the project treated as loans at the\nprevailing rate of interest at the time of construction, rehabilitation or\nconversion. The application of this subdivision does not in any way relieve the\nproject recipient from its obligation to restrict new occupancy to persons of\nlow income. (i) Other than initial\nrents, all rent increases are subject to the Emergency Tenant Protection Act or\n\nRent Stabilization Law in jurisdictions covered by these laws. Where these laws\nare not applicable, all rent increases shall be consistent with the applicant's\napproved plan for keeping rents affordable for persons of low income. The\nlimits as stated in subdivision (h) of this section shall apply in all cases\nunless the corporation determines that a higher rent is required to preserve\nthe feasibility of the project. (j) All units in a rental project shall continue to be subject to the Emergency\n\nTenant Protection Act or the Rent Stabilization Law as provided for in\nsubdivision (i) of this section after the period of regulation; termination of\nthe applicability of such laws to each unit shall occur upon the first vacancy\nof each said unit occuring after the expiration of the regulatory\nperiod.
