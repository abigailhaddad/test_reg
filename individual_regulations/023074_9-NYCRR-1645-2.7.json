  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.7 - Investments in U. S. series G and series K bonds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Investments in U. S. series G and K bonds\ndiffer from series F and series J bonds in that the G and K bonds are issued at\npar whereas the F and J bonds are issued at a discount. Series G bonds bear\ninterest at the rate of 2.50 per cent on the par value, payable semiannually by\ncheck to the registered owner. Series G bonds were issued until April 1952, at\nwhich time the U. S. Treasury replaced them by series K bonds. Series K bonds\nbear interest at the rate of 2.76 per cent on the par value, payable\nsemiannually by check to the registered owner. Series G and K bonds resemble\nseries F and J bonds in that they are registered, are not bought and sold in\nthe open market, but are issued and redeemed directly by the U. S. government\nthrough authorized agencies, and may be redeemed prior to maturity, in\naccordance with a table of redemption values printed on the bond. The\nredemption values decrease from par in the first five years from issue date and\nincrease thereafter until they reach par again when the bonds mature. The\nchanges in redemption values are not continuous, but occur at the end of each\nsix-month period beginning with the date of issue. The date of issue for series\nF, G, J and series K bonds is always the first day of the month in which the\nbonds were purchased and the date of maturity is 12 years from the date of\nissue. (b) When the bonds are\npurchased, the appropriate investment account should be charged with the\npurchase price, which in all cases will be par, or face, value. At the end of\neach six-month period, counting from the date of issue, account 1144, Accrued\n\nInterest Receivable on Investments, is charged with the nominal amount of the\ninterest, that is, at the rate of two and one-half per cent per annum for\nseries G and 2.76 per cent for series K on the par, or face, value of the\nbonds. During the period when the redemption value of the bonds is decreasing, the applicable investment account is credited with the decrease in redemption\nvalue and the difference between the nominal amount of the interest and the\ndecrease in the redemption value is credited to the appropriate interest earned\naccount. Six months from date of issue a $1,000 series G bond has a redemption\nvalue of $988. For bonds issued May 1, 1947 and purchased out of reserve funds, the journal entry on October 31, 1947 would be: Entry (4): Debit: Account 1144, Accrued Interest Receivable\non Investments\n$12.50\n\nCredit: Account 1176, Reserve Fund\n\nInvestments\n$12.00\n\nCredit: Account 2511, Interest Earned on Reserve\n\nFund Investments\n$.50\n\nExplanation:: To record interest accrued on U. S. series G bond, issued May 1, 1947, for the six months ending October 31, 1947. (c) During the period\nwhen the redemption value of the bond is increasing, the appropriate investment\naccount is charged with the increase in the redemption value the nominal\ninterest is charged to account 1144, Accrued Interest Receivable on\n\nInvestments, and the appropriate interest earned account is credited with the\nsum of the nominal interest and the increase in the redemption value. For\nexample, a $1,000 par value U. S. series G bond has a redemption value of $961\nat the end of seven years from date of issue, and of $964, at the end of seven\nand one-half years. The journal entry recording the interest accrued at the end\nof seven and one-half years, for a reserve fund investment would be: Entry (5): Debit: Account 1144, Accrued Interest Receivable\non Investments\n$12.50\n\nDebit: Account 1176, Reserve Fund\n\nInvestments\n$3.00\n\nCredit: Account 2511, Interest Earned on Reserve\n\nFund Investments\n$15.50\n\nExplanation:: To record interest accrued on U. S. series G bond\nissued May 1, 1947, for the six months ending October 31, 1954. (d) The semiannual\npayments of interest, when received, are credited to account 1144, Accrued\n\nInterest Receivable on Investments, and the proceeds, when the bonds are\nredeemed, or mature are credited to the appropriate investment account through\nthe cash receipts register. Series G and K bonds, like series F and J are\nsuitable only for long term investments, such as of replacement reserve funds. The amount of series F, G, J or series K bonds or the combined aggregate amount\nof both series that may be issued during any one calendar year to any one owner\nis limited to $100,000 (issue price). Inasmuch as the book value of investments\nin series F, G, J and K bonds will always be the same as the redemption value, no gain or loss will arise on redemption of the bonds prior to\nmaturity.
