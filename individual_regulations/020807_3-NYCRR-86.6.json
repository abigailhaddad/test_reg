  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 86.6 - Sale of control in connection with the conversion of mutual thrift institutions to stock-form\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to the provisions of this\nsubdivision and of section\n86.4\nof this Part, a mutual thrift\ninstitution having net worth (determined in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles) of less than three percent of assets as of the end of\nthe most recent period for which such institution has prepared audited\nfinancial statements, or which received net worth assistance from its Federal\ndeposit insurer within the 12-month period ending on the date on which the\napplication for conversion was filed with the superintendent, may seek approval\nto convert to stock form pursuant to a plan of conversion which provides for\nthe sale of its capital stock to a person or persons who will be in control of\nsuch institution upon the purchase of such capital stock. Such institution\nshall be required to retain a reputable financial advisor of national standing\nwith expertise in valuing financial institutions to advise it as to the\nfairness of the consideration to be paid by the proposed acquiror. The\nfinancial advisor shall furnish a written opinion specifically informing the\nconverting thrift institution as to the fairness from a financial point of view\nto the converting institution of the proposed consideration. Such written\nopinion shall specifically disclose in reasonable detail: (1)\nthe professional standards employed by\nthe financial advisor in arriving at its conclusions; and\n(2)\nthe factual basis upon which such\nconclusions were reached. The opinion shall specifically state whether or not the\nfinancial advisor, in arriving at its conclusions as to the fairness of the\nproposed consideration has made efforts to determine whether, in its judgment, there is the reasonably significant probability that financially able\npurchasers of the character generally capable of securing regulatory approval\nother than the proposed acquiror, given an opportunity, might have made good\nfaith offers to purchase control of the converting institution for a\nconsideration materially greater than that proposed to be paid by the proposed\nacquiror, and has compared the consideration to be paid by the proposed\nacquiror with the consideration paid in the purchase of other thrift\ninstitutions of comparable size, market area, profit history, competitive\nconditions and projected future earnings. If the financial advisor has made any\nsuch efforts or any such comparisons, the nature and scope of such efforts and\ncomparisons shall be discussed in detail. The written opinion shall state\nwhether and on what basis the financial advisor believes that the consideration\nto be paid by the proposed acquiror exceeds the aggregate amount of net\nproceeds which the converting institution could have realized if the capital\nstock to be sold to the proposed acquiror had been sold in a subscription\noffering followed by an underwritten public offering. The written opinion shall\nbe delivered to the Banking Department before any approval of the application\nfor conversion will be granted by the superintendent. (b) A mutual thrift institution\nwhich does not qualify for a conversion pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection may seek approval to convert to stock-form pursuant to a plan of\nconversion in which one or more persons will acquire control of such converting\ninstitution pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision and of section\n86.4\nof this Part. After such\nmutual institution has filed an application for conversion pursuant to the\nprovisions of this Part, any competing offeror may file with the superintendent\na plan of conversion providing for the purchase of control (wherein the same\npercentage of the aggregate capital stock of the converting institution\nproposed to be purchased pursuant to the plan of conversion adopted by the\nconverting institution will be purchased by the competing offeror) as an\nalternative to the plan of conversion filed by the converting institution. If\nsuch plan is approved by the superintendent, and if the Banking Board approval\nreferred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is obtained, then such\ncompeting offeror may present its plan of conversion to a vote of the\ndepositors or shareholders at any meeting thereof called by management of the\nconverting institution to vote upon the plan of conversion proposed by the\nconverting institution. Upon approval by at least 75 percent of the total votes\nof the converting institution's depositors or shareholders represented in\nperson or by valid proxy at such meeting, a competing offeror's plan of\nconversion will be adopted by the converting institution, and shall be binding\non the institution and the competing offeror. (c) The provisions of section\n86.4\nof this Part shall apply to\nany application for conversion which a competing offeror proposes to submit to\na meeting of depositors or shareholders, except that: (1)\n\nNo application for conversion of a\ncompeting offeror shall be accepted for filing by the superintendent unless it\nis filed with the superintendent within 10 days of the date that notice of\napproval of management's plan for conversion is approved by the superintendent\nis made public in the form referred to in section\n42\nof the Banking\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nAs soon as practicable, on\nthe date that the competing offer is delivered to the superintendent, the\ncompeting offeror shall hand-deliver a copy of such application, including all\nexhibits thereto, to the converting institution at its principal office, to the\nproposed acquiror, and to any other competing offeror which has filed an\napplication for conversion pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, at such\ncompeting offeror's principal executive offices. (d) In the event that such converting\ninstitution shall receive notice of any competing offers to purchase control of\nsuch institution, within the 10-day period referred to in subdivision (c) of\nthis section, such institution shall give notice of such competing offers to\nits depositors or shareholders as soon as possible. (e) The acceptance for filing by the\nsuperintendent of an application for conversion of a competing offeror shall, without further action on the part of the converting institution, extend the\ndate for the holding of the meeting of depositors or shareholders called to\napprove the plan of conversion approved by management of the converting\ninstitution to a date 70 days following the date on which notice of such\nmeeting is or was first given, unless such date falls on a weekend or legal\nholiday, in which case such meeting shall be held on the next business day. The\nnotice to depositors or shareholders referred to in subdivision (d) of this\nsection shall inform such depositors or shareholders of the revised date (and\nif applicable, the revised time and location) of such meeting. (f) Upon filing with the superintendent of an\napplication for conversion by a competing offeror, management of the converting\ninstitution shall not, without the prior written approval of the\nsuperintendent, further extend or cancel or otherwise terminate the meeting of\ndepositors or shareholders called to vote upon any plan of\nconversion. (g) If any competing\nofferor notifies the converting institution of such competing offeror's\nintention to present an alternative plan of conversion at the meeting of\ndepositors or shareholders called to vote on the plan of conversion approved by\nmanagement of the institution, the converting institution shall identify and\nprovide the information required by a short-form proxy statement with respect\nto the competing offeror's plan of conversion in management's form of proxy and\nthe converting institution's proxy statement.

(h) The\ncompeting offeror's plan of conversion may be presented at the meeting of\ndepositors or shareholders of the converting institution either by the\ncompeting offeror or its representative who is qualified under applicable law\nto make such presentation on the competing offeror's behalf at the meeting.
