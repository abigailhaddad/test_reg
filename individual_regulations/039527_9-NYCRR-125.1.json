A tier\n3 cultivator, tier 4 cultivator, tier 5 cultivator, ROD, or ROND licensee shall\nmeet applicable lighting standards prior to the first license\nrenewal. (c) Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and Dehumidification Standards. (1)\nHVAC Standards. A nursery, cultivator, cooperative, microbusiness, ROD, or ROND licensee authorized to cultivate\nindoors, cultivate in mixed light, operate a nursery area indoors, or operate a\nnursery area in mixed light shall, unless the licensee has a written plan for\nmanaging refrigerant leaks and disposal that has been approved by the Office, use HVAC and refrigeration equipment which uses a refrigerant with a\ntwenty-year global warming potential of 10 or less. (2)\n\nDehumidification Standards. A nursery, cultivator, cooperative, microbusiness, ROD, or ROND licensee shall only use\ndehumidification equipment, including in drying areas, that is one of the\nfollowing: (i) stand-alone dehumidifiers that\nhave a minimum integrated energy factor of 1.77 L/kWh for product case volumes\nof 8.0 cubic feet or less, and a minimum integrated energy factor of 2.41 L/kWh\nfor product case volumes greater than 8.0 cubic feet; (ii)\nan integrated HVAC system with on-site\nheat recovery designed to fulfill at least 75% of the annual energy for\ndehumidification reheat; (iii)\na\nchilled water system with on-site heat recovery designed to fulfill at least\n75% of the annual energy for dehumidification reheat; or\n(iv)\na solid or liquid desiccant\ndehumidification system for system designs that require dewpoint of 50°F or\nless. (3)\nA nursery, tier 1 cultivator, tier 2 cultivator, cooperative, or microbusiness licensee\nshall meet applicable HVAC and dehumidification standards prior to the second\nlicense renewal. (4)\nA tier 3\ncultivator, tier 4 cultivator, tier 5 cultivator, ROD, or ROND licensee shall\nmeet applicable HVAC and dehumidification standards prior to the first license\nrenewal. (d) Energy\n\nStandards. (1)\nA nursery, cultivator, cooperative, microbusiness, ROD, or ROND licensee authorized to cultivate\nindoors, cultivate in mixed light, operate a nursery area indoors, or operate a\nnursery area in mixed light shall install and use at least one interval meter\nsufficient to capture and track the energy usage in all areas where licensed\nactivities are conducted. (2)\nA\ntier 3 cultivator, tier 4 cultivator, tier 5 cultivator, cooperative, ROD, or\nROND licensees authorized to cultivate indoors shall use technologies for the\nprimary source of energy that do not involve on-site combustion of fossil\nfuels. It is acceptable for such licensee's emergency back-up system to be\ntechnology that involves the on-site combustion of fossil fuels. Acceptable\nalternatives to fossil fuel-based systems include, but are not limited to, ground-source (geothermal) systems or air-source heat pump systems. A tier 3\ncultivator, tier 4 cultivator, tier 5 cultivator, cooperative, ROD, or ROND\nshall meet this requirement prior to the first license renewal. (e) Water Standards. A nursery, cultivator, cooperative, microbusiness, ROD, or ROND licensee authorized to\ncultivate shall only utilize water for cultivation or in a nursery area, except\nfor water that is used for drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation, that has\nlevels of total coliform present consistent with 10 NYCRR Subpart\n5-1\nas tested\nby an environmental laboratory certified by the New York State Department of\n\nHealth. (f) Indoor Air Quality\n\nStandards. A retail dispensary or microbusiness licensee authorized to operate\na consumption facility or an on-site consumption licensee authorized to operate\nan exception area, shall, unless the indoor area's ventilation system has been\napproved by the Office to provide sufficient ventilation based on the\nfacility's maximum capacity, during times of smoking and vaping, utilize air\nquality monitor(s) or particle counter(s) or similar technology sufficiently\ncapable of accurately measuring the real-time number of fine particles in all\nindoor areas of the premises in which individuals may smoke or vape cannabis\nproducts. (1)\n\nUnless approved otherwise by the\n\nOffice, air quality monitors or particle counters or other similar technology\nsufficiently capable of accurately measuring the real-time number of fine\nparticles shall be: (i) capable of measuring\nconcentrations of fine particles up to at least 2,000 micrograms per cubic\nmeter (or µg/m\n3\n) within ten percent\naccuracy; (ii)\nused according to\nthe manufacturer's specifications to create a number of measurements that will\naccurately determine the average daily concentration of fine particles, based\non the size of the indoor area(s) and the strength of the monitors or counters; and\n(iii)\nmeet any other\nrequirements as determined by the Office; and\n(2)\n\nIn all indoor areas of the consumption\nfacility or exception area in which individuals may smoke or vape, a licensee\nshall utilize, alone or in combination, physical barriers, ventilation systems, technology, or other methods sufficient to: (i) prevent the transfer of visible smoke or\nvapor between the area of the consumption facility or exception area and the\nindoor area of the same building, indoor area of neighboring buildings, and any\noutdoor area of nearby businesses-such as restaurant patios-which are available\nto patrons of such nearby business at the same time that smoking or vaping is\noccurring at the consumption facility or exception area, provided that such\nneighboring areas do not also comprise a consumption facility or exception\narea; (ii)\nreduce the presence of\nfine particles in all indoor areas of the consumption facility or exception\narea such that, beginning on the sixty-first day after the consumption facility\nor exception area began operating, the average twenty-four (24) hour\nconcentration of fine particles per cubic meter of air in all indoor areas in\nwhich individuals may smoke or vape is less than 500 for at least 90% of the\ndays the consumption facility or exception area operates within a given\ncalendar month, unless the indoor area's ventilation system has been approved\nby the Office to provide sufficient ventilation based on the maximum capacity\nof the consumption facility or exception area or the licensee has been\notherwise approved in writing by both the Board and the municipality in which\nthe consumption facility or exception area is located to allow greater\nconcentrations of fine particles; and\n(iii)\nmeasure the concentration of fine\nparticles within all indoor areas of the consumption facility or exception area\nin which individuals may smoke or vape through one of the following methods: (a) using technology that automatically\ncalculates the average concentration of fine particles per cubic meter of air\nmeasured over a twenty-four (24) hour period; (b) using technology that measures the\nconcentration of fine particles per cubic meter of air for specific period of\ntime and calculating a twenty-four (24) hour average by measuring the\nconcentration of fine particles per cubic meter of air for a period of no less\nthan five minutes at least once per hour during each of the consumption\nfacility or exception area's hours of operation. A licensee using this method\nmay calculate the twenty-four (24) hour average using reasonable data regarding\nthe typical concentration of fine particles per cubic meter of air when the\nlimited retail consumption facility is not open to consumers and would not be\nrequired to measure the concentration of fine particles during each hour the\nconsumption facility is closed to consumers; or\n(c) any other method approved by the Office; and\n(3)\n\nThe\n\nOffice shall have the authority to require a licensee to update, alter, or\namend the specific technology used to monitor indoor air quality, or their\nplacement, at any time if it has reason to believe the air quality is being\ninaccurately measured. (g) The Office shall have the authority to\nissue industry advisories pursuant to subdivision 12 of section\n11\nof the Cannabis\n\nLaw, pertaining to the energy and environment standards. Such advisories shall\nbe adhered to by the licensee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
