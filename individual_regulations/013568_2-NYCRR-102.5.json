Tit. 2 § 102.5 - Recipients\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No recipient\nhas been or shall be compelled to participate in the program for direct deposit\nof his or her wages or salary. In the event a recipient elects to participate\nin the program, the recipient shall not be compelled to establish an account\nfor receipt of payment instructions with a particular financial institution as\na condition of employment or receipt of recurring payments, except that only\nparticipating financial institutions as defined in this Part may be so\ndesignated by any recipient. (b) In\norder for a recipient to receive a recurring payment by the automated\nclearinghouse method under this Part, at a financial institution of the\nrecipient's choosing and to an account the title of which includes the\nrecipient's name, the recipient shall execute the applicable portion of the\ndirect deposit of salary enrollment form prescribed by the Department of Audit\nand Control for such recurring payments and deliver it to the employee's agency\npayroll office or to such financial institution. When appropriate, the\nfinancial institution shall complete the form and verify the information\nthereon. (c) In executing a direct\ndeposit of salary enrollment form, a recipient: (1)\ndesignates the financial institution and\nthe account on the books of such financial institution to which the amount of\nthe payments shall be credited; (2)\nis deemed to agree to the provisions of this Part including without limitation, the provisions regarding recovery of erroneous payments; and\n(3)\nauthorizes the Department of Audit and\n\nControl to terminate any previously executed direct deposit of salary\nenrollment form or any other inconsistent payment instructions applicable to\nthe relevant recurring payment. (d) If a recipient wishes to direct a\nrecurring payment to a different financial institution, the recipient shall\nexecute a new direct deposit of salary enrollment form. (e) Once a direct deposit of salary\nenrollment form has been effected, it shall remain in effect until it is\nterminated by one of the following events: (1)\na request by the recipient to terminate his or her participation in the direct\ndeposit program by notifying the Department of Audit and Control through the\nrecipient's personnel office or payroll office; (2)\nthe death of a recipient; (3)\na change in the title of an account which\nremoves the name of the recipient or adds the name of a joint tenant; or\n(4)\nthe closing of the account. Upon the occurrence of a change in the account title, the\nrecipient shall execute a new direct deposit of salary enrollment form before\nfurther payments may be made to the recipient's account. (f) When appropriate, a financial\ninstitution may change accounts or account numbers by adhering to established\n\nAutomated Clearing House procedures for processing notifications of\nchange. (g) If the account to which\nthe recurring payment is to be made is a joint account, each joint tenant must\nalso sign the direct deposit of salary enrollment form. By signing such form, the recipient/employee and joint tenant each consent to allow the State, through the financial institution, to recover payments as specified in section\n102.8\nof this Part made to the\naccount, all or any part of which the recipient/employee was not eligible to\nreceive. Such payments include funds received after the death of the\nrecipient/employee as a result of the lag payroll system, where applicable, or\nfunds received due to an erroneous payment, or any salary payment made by\nmistake to the account pursuant to this program. This means of recovery is not\nan exclusive remedy and shall not prevent the State from utilizing any other\nlawful means to retrieve payments to which the recipient/employee is not\nentitled.
