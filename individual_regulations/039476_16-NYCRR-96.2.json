(b) Existing direct metered multi-unit\nresidential premises. Except as otherwise provided in this Part, electric service\nprovided to individual residential units in existing multi-unit residential\npremises through direct metering may not be discontinued or replaced by master\nmetering.

(c) Assisted living and senior living\nfacilities. Electric service is authorized to be established or continued to\nassisted living or senior living facilities through master metering.
