Estimated costs shall be submitted in lieu of actual costs for a period no greater than two years. If actual costs are not submitted to the State within two years from the date when prevocational services were first provided at the site, the amount of capital costs included in the rate shall be zero for each period in which actual costs are not submitted. The department may retroactively adjust the capital component. (v) Cost verified rates for capital assets approved on or after July 1, 2015. The provider shall submit to the State supporting documentation of actual costs. Actual costs shall be verified by the State reviewing the supporting documentation of such costs. A provider submitting such actual costs shall certify that the reimbursement requested reflects allowable capital costs and that such costs were actually expended by such provider.
