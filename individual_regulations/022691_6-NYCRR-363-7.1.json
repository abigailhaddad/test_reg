  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-7.1 - Operating Requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the operating requirements set forth in\nsection\n360.19\nof this Title, all landfills\nregulated under this Part must comply with this section. (a) Waste control requirements. (1)\n\nFinal external slopes must not be greater\nthan 33 percent, but interim external slopes may exceed 33 percent if the owner\nor operator demonstrates to the department's satisfaction that a proposed\ngreater slope is stable and the slope will settle to 33 percent or less prior\nto closure of the landfill cell. (2)\n\nThe first layer of waste placed above the\nprimary leachate collection and removal system must be a minimum of five feet\nin compacted thickness, be of a select nature containing no large rigid\nobjects, and be placed in a manner to avoid damage to the liner\nsystem. (3)\n\nDrilling and production\nwaste may not be placed within six feet of the leachate collection and removal\nsystem or within ten feet of any final cover. (4)\n\nLow-permeability or low shear-strength\nwaste must be blended with other wastes to minimize waste mass instability and\nmaximize leachate movement through the waste mass. (5)\n\nRadioactive waste detection procedures\nand requirements. (i) Landfills which accept\nMSW or drilling and production wastes must install and operate a fixed\nradiation detection unit at a location appropriate for the monitoring of all\nincoming waste. (ii)\n\nThe\ninvestigation alarm setpoint of the radiation detector must be set at least two\ntimes but no greater than five times site background radiation\nlevels. (iii)\n\nBackground radiation\nreadings at the facility must be measured and recorded at least\ndaily. (iv)\n\nField checks of the\nradiation detector utilizing a known radiation source must be performed and\nrecorded at least weekly. (v) The\nradiation detector must be calibrated at least annually or more often as\nrecommended by the manufacturer, and documentation describing the calibration\nmust be maintained at the facility. (vi)\n\nEach instance in which the radiation\ndetector is triggered by a waste load must be documented and reported to the\ndepartment within 24 hours. Recorded information must include the date the\nwaste was received, transporter name, origin of the waste, truck number or\nother identifying marking, detector reading, disposition of the waste, and date\nof disposition. (b) Operating cover. Operating cover must be\napplied in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision and the cover\nmaterial management plan. (1)\n\nOperating cover\nor alternative operating cover must effectively control vectors, fires, odors, dust, and blowing litter. (2)\nA\nminimum of six inches of compacted operating cover must be applied to all\nexposed waste at the close of each operating day, or at a more frequent\ninterval if necessary, unless an alternative thickness or material is approved\npursuant to section\n363-6.21\nof this Part. (3)\nA minimum of 12 inches of compacted\noperating cover must be applied and maintained on all landfill surfaces where\nno additional waste has been or will be placed within 30 calendar days of the\nlast placement of waste, unless an alternative thickness or material is\napproved pursuant to section\n363-6.21\nof this Part. If odor\nproblems are not controlled, additional measures must be implemented. (4)\n\nThe total annual tonnage of alternative\noperating cover approved pursuant to section\n363-6.21\n(c) of\nthis Part must be identified separate from the total annual tonnage for\ndisposal in the facility's permit to operate. The facility must not exceed the\ntotal annual tonnage of alternative operating cover. Any exceedance of the\ntotal annual tonnage of alternative operating cover must be reported to the\ndepartment in accordance with the permit and with section\n363-8.2\nof this Part. (5)\n\nAlternative operating cover material\napproved pursuant to subdivision\n363-6.21\n(c) of\nthis Part must be stored over a lined area of the landfill and run-off from the\nmaterial must be managed as leachate. (c) Intermediate cover. An intermediate cover\nmust be applied and maintained on all external slopes for every 20 feet of\nvertical rise. (d) Final cover. The\nfinal cover system must be installed and maintained in accordance with the\nrequirements of Subpart 363-9 of this Part. (e) Decomposition gases. Decomposition gases\ngenerated within a landfill must be controlled to prevent safety issues and\noff-site odors. Measures to control decomposition gases must be undertaken in\naccordance with the following requirements: (1)\nin landfills which receive putrescible\nwaste or construction and demolition debris, horizontal landfill gas lines must\nbe installed in the waste mass at a horizontal spacing of not more than 100\nfeet and a vertical spacing of not more than 20 feet and must extend across the\nentire waste mass except that they must terminate not more than 100 feet from\nthe exterior slope of the waste mass. The department may approve site-specific\nspacing of the landfill gas collection lines in landfills that receive only\nconstruction and demolition debris with the condition that if nuisance odor\nissues occur the landfill will be required to meet the spacing requirements\nspecified in this paragraph. (2)\nthe concentration of methane and other explosive gases must not exceed 25\npercent of the lower explosive limit for gases: (i) at or beyond the property boundary; or\n(ii)\nwithin on-site structures\nexcluding gas management or recovery system components; (3)\nan ongoing gas monitoring program must be\nimplemented throughout the active life, post-closure care period, and custodial\ncare period to ensure that the requirements of paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision are met. The type and frequency of monitoring must be approved by\nthe department and be based on the following factors: soil conditions; the\nhydrogeologic conditions surrounding the disposal area; the hydraulic\nconditions surrounding the disposal site; and the location of any man-made\nstructures and property boundaries. Monitoring must be conducted at least\nquarterly; (4)\nmonitoring must be\nperformed at 100-foot maximum intervals where temporary sampling locations are\nused, or at 400-foot maximum intervals where permanent gas monitoring wells are\nconstructed. Initial monitoring must be performed when atmospheric pressure and\nwind velocity are low and when the ground surface has been wet or frozen for\nseveral days. Monitoring must be done below the wet or frozen zone if\npresent; (5)\nupon detection of\nmethane or other explosive gas levels exceeding the limits specified in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, the landfill operator must immediately take\naction to avoid hazards to public health and the environment, and must: (i) Within 24 hours of detection, notify the\ndepartment; (ii)\nwithin seven days\nof detection, submit to the department the methane or other explosive gas\nlevels detected and provide a description of the steps taken to protect health, safety, and property; and\n(iii)\nwithin 30 days of detection, submit a plan and a schedule to remediate any\ncontinuing methane or other explosive gas releases. The plan must describe the\nnature and extent of the problem and the proposed remedy, and be implemented\nupon department approval. (f) Leachate management. (1)\n\nLeachate must be managed in accordance\nwith the department-approved leachate management plan. (2)\n\nLeachate depth (head) above the primary\nliner system may not exceed 12 inches, except during and within a seven-day\nperiod following storm events and in designed sump areas. Both the primary and\nsecondary leachate collection and removal systems must be operated in a\nfree-draining manner so as not to cause a leachate head buildup above the\nrespective liner system. (3)\n\nAll\nrun-off which either emanates from active portions of the landfill disposal\nareas covered only with alternative operating cover which was generated from\nwaste or has come into contact with waste or leachate must be considered\nleachate and be appropriately managed by the landfill's leachate collection and\nremoval system. (4)\n\nLeachate must\nbe monitored as required by subparagraph 363-4.6(f)(8)(iii) of this\n\nSubpart. (5)\n\nStormwater within the\nsecondary containment area of the leachate storage tank system must be removed\nso as to maintain a minimum of 100 percent containment capacity for the largest\nstorage tank within the secondary containment area. (6)\n\nStormwater that collects within the\nsecondary containment system of the leachate storage tank system must be\ncontrolled by a manually operated pump or a gravity drain pipe with a manually\ncontrolled valve. If a gravity drain pipe is used, all valves must be in a\nclosed position and locked except when the operator is in the process of\ndraining uncontaminated stormwater. (7)\n\nAllowable leakage rate. If flow within\nthe secondary leachate collection and removal system exceeds 20 gallons per\nacre per day (based on a rolling 30-day average), the owner or operator must\nimplement the following procedures, at a minimum: (i) notify the department within 72 hours\nfrom the time of the exceedance; (ii)\nsample and analyze secondary leachate\nfor baseline parameters; (iii)\nsubmit a preliminary written assessment to the department within 14 days of the\nexceedance, which must include any short-term actions that have either been\ntaken or are planned, a description of the amount of liquid observed, and the\nsuspected cause of the excessive leakage rate exhibited, considering\nprecipitation events and the possible location, size and cause of potential\nleaks; (iv)\ninvestigate and\ndetermine, to the extent practicable, the location, size and cause of the\nleaks; (v) determine whether waste\nreceipt should cease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be removed from\nthe cell for inspection, repairs, or controls, and whether the cell should be\nclosed; (vi)\ndetermine any other\nshort-term or long-term actions to be taken to reduce the leakage\nrate; (vii)\nwithin 30 days after\nthe notification that the allowable leakage rate has been exceeded, submit to\nthe department the results of the determinations specified in subparagraphs\n(ii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this paragraph, the results of the actions taken, and actions planned. Monthly thereafter, so long as the flow rate in the\nsecondary leachate collection and removal system exceeds the allowable leakage\nrate, a report must be submitted to the department summarizing the results of\nany remedial actions taken and actions planned in order to reduce the leakage\nto an allowable level; and\n(viii)\ntake other measures as the department may require based on the significance of\nthe leakage, including but not limited to cell or facility closure, if the\nleakage rate cannot be reduced to less than 20 gallons per acre per day within\nsix months. (g) Maintenance for primary and secondary\nleachate collection and removal systems. (1)\n\nThe primary leachate collection and removal system must be cleaned annually and\nmaintained in good operating condition. The owner or operator may request that\nthe department waive the cleaning requirement based on the results of the video\ninspection in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. The department will not grant\nwaivers in consecutive years. (2)\n\nVideo inspection of any primary leachate collection and removal system and\nsecondary leachate collection and removal system constructed in accordance with\nthis Part must be performed at least biennially. (3)\n\nMonitoring of secondary leachate\ncollection and removal system flowrates must be conducted and recorded daily\nwhen the facility is operating. (4)\n\nAn operational log for recording monthly total leachate generation amounts and\na maintenance log for documenting compliance with paragraph (1) through (3) of\nthis subdivision must be kept at the site and included in the landfill's annual\nreport. (h) Leachate\nrecirculation\n(1)\n\nLeachate recirculation is\nonly allowed in cells constructed with double composite liners and in which\nactive gas collection and destruction is performed. If allowed, the following\nconditions must be met. (i) A leachate\nrecirculation system must terminate no closer than 100 feet from the exterior\nslope of the waste mass. (ii)\n\nLeachate recirculation rates must be established and primary leachate flowrates\nmust be monitored to ensure that the receiving waste mass does not become\nsaturated. (iii)\n\nThe landfill must\ndemonstrate that the allowable leakage rate measured in the secondary leachate\ncollection and removal system has not been exceeded during the previous 12\nmonths. (2)\n\nDuring\nleachate recirculation, leachate must not be introduced directly onto operating\ncover. (i) Moisture\ncontent of waste. Wastes accepted for disposal must exhibit no free liquids and\nmust contain a minimum of 20 percent solids. All dredged materials and sludges\nother than sewage sludge accepted for disposal must be dewatered to 20 percent\nor more solids and exhibit no free liquid as defined by SW-846 Method 9095 -\nPaint Filter Liquids Test, incorporated by reference in section\n360.3\nof this Title. (j) Biosolids. All biosolids accepted for\ndisposal must be stabilized, dewatered to a minimum of 20 percent solids, and\nexhibit no free liquid as defined by SW-846 Method 9095 - Paint Filter Liquids\n\nTest, incorporated by reference in section\n360.3\nof this Title. Biosolids that\nare disposed of must meet the following stabilization criteria, except if it\ncan be demonstrated to the department's satisfaction that the equivalent level\nof odor reduction can be achieved through alternative methods: (1)\n\nThe biosolids must be either digested or\nlime stabilized. If lime is used, sufficient lime must be added to raise the pH\nof the sludge to 12 for at least 30 minutes. The level of treatment must be\nadequate to reasonably prevent nuisance conditions. (2)\n\nBiosolids cannot be accepted for disposal\nfrom a sewage treatment plant that has a biosolids treatment process other than\ndigestion or lime stabilization unless one of the following criteria is\nsatisfied: (i) The mass of volatile solids in\nthe biosolids has been reduced by a minimum of 38 percent. (ii)\n\nFor biosolids treated in an aerobic\nprocess, the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) is equal to or less than 1.5\nmilligrams of oxygen per hour per gram of total solids (dry weight basis), at a\ntemperature of 20 degrees Celsius. (iii)\n\nThe biosolids are composted for a\nminimum of 14 days. Throughout that treatment time, the temperature of the\nbiosolids must remain higher than 40 degrees Celsius, and the average\ntemperature of the biosolids must be higher than 45 degrees Celsius. (iv)\n\nThe percent solids of the biosolids are\nequal to or greater than 75 percent. (k) Friable asbestos-containing waste\ndisposal. Friable asbestos-containing waste or material contaminated with\nfriable asbestos-containing waste may only be disposed of at a landfill if the\nfollowing measures and precautions are taken: (1)\nthe landfill must have a protocol in\nplace as part of their waste control plan describing procedures for receipt of\nfriable asbestos-containing waste and placement in the landfill; (2)\nthe area designated for disposal of\nfriable asbestos-containing waste must be recorded on an operations site plan\nso that precautions can be taken to properly handle the friable\nasbestos-containing waste in the event of future construction or regrading in\nthis area; (3)\nthe friable\nasbestos-containing waste must either be placed into a pre-dug trench in the\nexisting waste or at the bottom of the working face. The friable\nasbestos-containing waste must be backfilled or covered with at least three\nfeet of waste or 18 inches of soil before compaction to isolate the friable\nasbestos-containing waste; and\n(4)\nfriable asbestos-containing waste must be prevented from becoming airborne or\ncoming into contact with landfill equipment. (l) Non-friable asbestos-containing waste\ndisposal. Non-friable asbestos-containing waste may be disposed of at a\nlandfill, provided it is not reduced in size, crushed, or processed in any\nmanner before being placed under operating cover or another lift of\nwaste. (m) Inspection for\nunauthorized waste. At a minimum frequency of once per week, the owner or\noperator must select a waste collection vehicle at random and unload its waste\nfor a detailed inspection for unauthorized wastes. A record of the results of\nthis inspection must be kept on the premises and be available for department\nreview. (n) Weight scales. Any\nlandfill that accepts at least 20 tons of waste per day averaged over the\noperating days for a calendar year must install and utilize a scale. Landfills\nthat accept less than 20 tons of waste per day must utilize a\ndepartment-approved alternate means of quantifying the weight of waste\nreceived. (o) Disposal\nprohibitions. Disposal of the following is prohibited: (1)\nwaste tires, except solid rubber tires\n(non-pneumatic); (2)\nlead acid\nbatteries; (3)\nsource-separated\nrecyclables, source-separated HHW, source-separated electronic waste, source-separated rechargeable batteries, source-separated mercury-containing\nproducts, and other source-separated items that are subject to legislatively\nenacted product stewardship programs in New York State; (4)\nmercury-added consumer products as\ndefined in ECL section 27-2101 or mercury-added thermostats as defined in\nsection 27-2901; (5)\nbulk liquids.

(q) Training requirements. (1)\n\nLandfill operations must be directed by a\nfacility operator who has attended and successfully completed within 12 months\nof their date of employment, a landfill operations training course which is\napproved by the department. The operator must renew this training every five\nyears. Proof of training must be kept on file at the facility. (2)\n\nTraining related to radiation detection\nsystem operating procedures and radiation investigation alarm response\nprocedures must be conducted at least annually. (r) Deed restriction. The landfill owner must\nplace a deed restriction on the property. The deed restriction must run with\nthe land in perpetuity as long as any waste disposed at the landfill remains. (1)\n\nAll landfill owners must submit to the\ndepartment for approval a proposed deed restriction within one year of the\neffective date of the permit. The proposed deed restriction must include a\ndiscussion of the planned site life for the landfill operation with a general\ndescription of the types of waste received and description of the proposed\nlandfill end use. The proposed deed restriction must include a survey and a\nmap, that clearly indicates the existing and proposed limits of the disposal\nareas within the property boundary. The landfill owner shall record the deed\nrestriction within 30 days of approval by the department, in the office of the\nrecording officer for the county or counties where the property is situated in\na manner prescribed by Article 9 of the Real Property Law. The landfill owner\nmust submit to the department a certified copy of the filed deed restriction\nwith the indexing information from the appropriate county clerk's office within\n30 days of its recording. (2)\n\nAn\nupdated property deed restriction must be submitted with the facility closure\nplan to the department for approval in accordance with section\n363-9.3\n(e). This\nupdated deed restriction must indicate the period of time during which the\nproperty has been used as a landfill, describe the wastes contained within the\nlandfill, and must note that records for this facility have been filed with the\ndepartment. The updated deed restriction must indicate that the closed landfill\nis subject to a post-closure care plan and a custodial care plan filed with the\ndepartment and must include a survey and a map, that clearly indicates the\nlimits of the disposal areas within the property boundary. The landfill owner\nshall record the deed restriction within 30 days of approval by the department, in the office of the recording officer for the county or counties where the\nproperty is situated in a manner prescribed by Article 9 of the Real Property\n\nLaw. The landfill owner must submit to the department a certified copy of the\nfiled deed restriction with the indexing information from the appropriate\ncounty clerk's office within 30 days of its recording. (s) Financial assurance.
