Tit. 6 § 673.3 - General provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any\nowner of a dam shall at all times operate and maintain the dam and all\nappurtenant works in a safe condition. (b) Based on information that is or becomes\navailable to the department, the owner of any dam may be found to be in\nviolation of subdivision (a) of this section, or the dam may be found to be an\nillegal dam, notwithstanding the condition rating or hazard classification of\nthe dam, or in the absence of the assignment of a condition rating or hazard\nclassification to the dam. (c) Upon\nreasonable notice, the owner of a dam shall furnish any available information\nwhich is reasonably necessary for the department's inspection or investigation\nof the dam and appurtenant works, and the assessment of the safety thereof, including, without limitation, the records and reports required to be\nmaintained pursuant to this Part. Failure of an owner to provide the\ninformation requested is a violation of this Part and ECL article 15, section\n0507. (d) The applicability of this\n\nPart to a dam or dam owner shall not depend on: (1)\nwhether a hazard classification or\ncondition rating has been assigned to the dam pursuant to section\n673.5\nor\n673.16\n(d) of this\n\nPart; or\n(2)\nthe condition rating\nthat has been assigned to a dam. (e) The owner of a dam who fails to: (1)\noperate and maintain a dam in a safe\ncondition as determined by the department; (2)\nconstruct a dam in accordance with permit\nconditions; or\n(3)\ncomply with any\nsection of this Part, is subject to the provisions of ECL article 15, sections\n0507 and 0511. (f) Every\nviolation of any subdivision of this Part shall be a separate and distinct\noffense; and in the case of a continuing violation of any subdivision of this\n\nPart, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate and distinct\noffense. (g) Nothing in this Part\nprecludes the commissioner from issuing a summary abatement order pursuant to\nECL article 71, section 0301, and Parts 620 and 622 of this Title, whenever the\ncommissioner finds that any person is causing, engaging in or maintaining a\ncondition or activity which presents an imminent danger to the health or\nwelfare of the people of the State, or results in or is likely to result in\nirreversible or irreparable damage to natural resources. (h) Nothing in this Part precludes the\ncommissioner from exercising the department's authority pursuant to ECL article\n3, section 0301(2)(aa) for a construction emergency related to a dam, whenever\nthe commissioner finds that a dam presents an imminent danger of failure, in\norder to protect life, property or natural resources. (i) The department may, at its discretion, accept equivalent reports in lieu, in whole or in part, of the reports of\ninspections and assessments required in this Part. Such reports may consist of\nreports conducted and prepared by governmental agencies (e.g., reports prepared\nfor or by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Natural\n\nResources Conservation Service (NRCS), etc.), or consist of assessment reports\ncertified by a dam owner and submitted to other governmental agencies (e.g., FERC). (j) The department may\nextend the time frames and schedules provided for in this Part in appropriate\ncircumstances when it is determined that compliance will result in\nextraordinary economic hardship. An application for an extension shall be\naccompanied by such information as the department requires. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
