  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 89.3 - Additional tobacco products tax on inventory\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 471-b, 472, 473-a, 475\n(a) Effective July 2, 2002, by enactment of\nchapter 85 of the Laws of 2002, section 471-b of article 20 of the Tax Law\nincreased the tax on tobacco products possessed in New York State by any person\nfor sale from 20 percent to 37 percent of the wholesale price of such products. It is presumed that all tobacco products within this State are subject to tax\nuntil the contrary is established, and the burden of proving that any tobacco\nproducts are not taxable shall be upon the person in possession\nthereof. (b) Every dealer of\ntobacco products (whether a wholesale dealer or a retail dealer), including\ndistributors, shall take a physical inventory of all tobacco products possessed\nin this State as of the close of business on July 1, 2002. Because it may be\nimpossible to take a physical inventory of tobacco products in all vending\nmachines that are on location throughout the State, a dealer may take as many\nphysical inventories of the contents of such machines as is possible with\navailable personnel. For those machines that cannot be physically inventoried\non July 1, 2002, tobacco products may be accounted for at one-half of the\nnormal fill capacities of such machines, as reflected in the individual\ninventory records maintained for such machines. (c) Returns and payments. (1)\n(i) On\nor before September 20, 2002, every such dealer shall file a return with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, on a form prescribed by the department for\nsuch purpose, showing the quantity and wholesale price of all such tobacco\nproducts possessed as of the July 1, 2002, inventory. Such return must reflect\nthe entire wholesale and/or retail inventories of the dealer within the State, as required by the department, regardless of the number of business locations\nof the dealer. Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, every\ndealer shall pay with the filing of such return an additional tobacco products\ntax at the rate of 17 percent of the wholesale price of each tobacco product in\nsuch inventory upon which the tobacco products tax has been paid at the rate of\n20 percent. (See paragraph [2] of this subdivision for information regarding\nthe retail dealer election pertaining to wholesale price.)\n(ii)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Title to the contrary, a dealer who has an additional tobacco products tax\nliability on inventory may elect to pay such tax in two installments. The first\ninstallment is due with the filing of the return on or before September 20, 2002 and shall not be less than 25 percent of the entire additional tobacco\nproducts tax due. Provided, however, in no event shall such installment be less\nthan $200 or the entire additional tobacco products tax due, if less than $200. Thus, a dealer having an additional tobacco products tax liability on inventory\nof $100 would be liable for the full payment on September 20, 2002; a dealer\nhaving such a liability of $440 would be liable for a first installment of at\nleast $200; and a dealer having such a liability of $1,000 would be liable for\na first installment of at least $250 ($1,000 × 25 percent). The second and\nfinal installment must be paid to the department on or before January 20, 2003, and must be accompanied by a final payment document prescribed by the\ndepartment for this purpose. Where the department has cause to believe that the\nfinal installment of the additional tobacco products tax on inventory may be\njeopardized by delay, the department may require such payment at any time prior\nto January 20, 2003. (See subdivision [e] of this section for sanctions\nconcerning untimely installments.)\n(2)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Title and exclusively for purposes of the additional tobacco products tax\non inventory on hand at the close of business on July 1, 2002, a retail dealer\nmay, if the dealer so elects, compute such tax using 50 percent of the price at\nwhich the dealer sells the tobacco products at retail in New York State\n(determined without regard to any State or local sales taxes imposed by article\n28 of the Tax Law or pursuant to the authority of article 29 of such law) as\nthe wholesale price. (3)\n\nThe\nadditional tobacco products tax on inventory and any applicable installment\nshould be paid by check or money order, payable to the NYS Tobacco Products\n\nTax. (4)\n\nReturns for payment of the\nadditional tobacco products tax on inventory and final payment documents may be\nobtained from the Department of Taxation and Finance, Taxpayer Contact Center, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. (d) On and after July 2, 2002, every\ndistributor appointed or required to be appointed by the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance (see section 471-b.2 of the Tax Law) shall be liable for\nthe payment of the tax at the rate of 37 percent of the wholesale price on\ntobacco products imported or caused to be imported into the State, manufactured\nin the State or, if authorized by the commissioner, sold, shipped, or delivered\nto any person in the State by such distributor. However, every dealer shall be\nliable for such tax on all tobacco products in the dealer's possession upon\nwhich the tax has not been paid or assumed by a distributor appointed or\nrequired to be appointed by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance as\nevidenced by such a distributor's invoice or other proof of payment or\nassumption of tax. (e) (1)\n\nFailure to file a return on tobacco\nproduct inventory or to pay the additional tax due thereon, or failure to\ncomply with any provision of this section or article 20 of the Tax Law may\nresult in civil or criminal sanctions, or both. (2)\n\nIn the case of any dealer who elects to\npay the additional tobacco products tax liability in installments, as described\nin subdivision (c) of this section, if the required first installment is not\nproperly paid on or before September 20, 2002, the entire amount of additional\ntax shall be due and owing, and any civil penalty and interest imposed pursuant\nto section\n481\nof the Tax Law will accrue from such\ndate on the entire tax liability that remains unpaid. Where the required first\ninstallment is timely paid but any portion of the second and final installment\nis paid after January 20, 2003, any civil penalty and interest so imposed will\naccrue from such date on the unpaid balance.
