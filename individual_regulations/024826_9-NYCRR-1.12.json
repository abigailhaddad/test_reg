Tit. 9 § 1.12 - Executive Order No. 12: [Appointing commissioners to investigate State and local activities relating to the aid, care and support of the needy.]\nState Regulations\nTO ALL WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME, GREETING: The maintenance of public confidence in the objectives and\nin the operation of the laws relating to the aid, care and support of the needy\nis an essential task for responsible government. In such public confidence lies the hope of the unfortunate\nand this confidence depends upon the conviction of the people of the State that\ntheir tax dollars are expended in a manner best calculated to further the\nsocial and humanitarian purposes for which public assistance and care are\nauthorized. Programs for aid, care and support of the needy must not be\npermitted to falter or lose their purpose; they must always be the vigorous and\ncompassionate instrument of the entire community for human betterment and\nsocial progress. Existing laws and administrative procedure should be\nscrutinized, needless red tape wherever found should be eliminated, and any\npractices found which tend to discourage self-reliance should be\nrevised. There is also a need for a precise and impartial evaluation\nof information to dispel the misunderstanding and confusion which arise from a\nlack of knowledge or from misrepresentation as to the facts relating to the\naid, care and support of the needy. The State Constitution provides that\n\"The aid, care and support of the needy are public concerns\nand shall be provided by the State and by such of its subdivisions, and in such\nmanner and by such means, as the Legislature may from time to time\ndetermine.\"\nThis principle is based upon the concept of individual\ndignity, fundamental to our State and Nation, and upon our concern for the\nwell-being of the less fortunate. It must find expression in the effective\nadministration of public welfare which assures that no willing and worthy\nperson in need is deprived of assistance and which recognizes at the same time\nthat any receipt of an undeserved benefit undermines the purposes of such\nassistance by damaging the public's confidence. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Nelson A. Rockefeller, pursuant to\n\nSection\nsix\nof the\n\nExecutive Law have appointed and by these presents do appoint S. Hazard\n\nGillespie (Chairman), Mrs. Arthur C. Aulisi, Kenneth Bartlett, John A. Coleman, Sr., Manuel Goldman, Nelson C. Jackson, Gustave L. Levy, Baldwin Maull, Joseph\n\nMonserrat, Mrs. James S. Seymour and David Sullivan as Commissioners generally\nto study, examine, investigate, review and make recommendations with respect to\nthe management and affairs of any department, board, bureau or commission of\nthe State concerned with State and local activities relating to the aid, care\nand support of the needy and specifically the following matters: (1)\n\nThe suitability of the laws and of the\npractices and procedures relating to the aid, care and support of the needy to\nassure humane, efficient and economical welfare services to those in\nneed.
