  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2520.13 - Waiver of benefit void\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn agreement by the tenant to waive the benefit of any\nprovision of the RSL or this Code is void; provided, however, that based upon a\nnegotiated settlement between the parties and with the approval of the DHCR, or\na court of competent jurisdiction, or where a tenant is represented by counsel, a tenant may withdraw, with prejudice, any complaint pending before the DHCR. Such settlement shall be binding upon subsequent tenants. However, where the\nsettlement encompasses surrender of occupancy by the tenant or the tenant is no\nlonger in possession of the housing accommodation as of the date of the\nsettlement, such settlement shall not be binding upon any subsequent tenant, except to the extent that the complaint being settled is subject to the time\nlimitations set forth in the RSL and this Code. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n2520.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
