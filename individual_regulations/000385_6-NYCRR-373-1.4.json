  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-1.4 - Permit application requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThese requirements apply to the owner or\noperator of a hazardous waste management facility who is required by this Part\nto apply for a permit to construct or operate a facility. At any time after\npromulgation of this Part, the owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste\nmanagement facility which has interim status may be required to submit a Part\n373 permit application. Any owner or operator will be allowed at least six\nmonths from the date of request to submit the permit application. Any owner or\noperator of an existing hazardous waste management facility may voluntarily\nsubmit a Part 373 permit application at any time. Procedures for application, issuance and administration of research, development and demonstration permits\nare found exclusively in section\n373-1.9\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. The expanded public participation requirements are included in section\n373-1.10\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nPermit applicant. Whenever the owner and\nthe operator of a facility are different persons, both the owner and the\noperator will be issued a permit for the facility. The operator is responsible\nfor obtaining the required permit, but the owner is also required to sign the\npermit application. The operator must also receive the owner's permission to\nconduct all regulated activities, including adequate agreement for site access\nduring the post-closure period for disposal facilities. Failure to furnish a\nrequested Part 373 permit application on time, or to furnish in full the\ninformation required by the permit application, is grounds for termination of\ninterim status under section\n373-1.3\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart and constitutes a violation of this Subpart. (3)\n\nForms. Applications for permits pursuant\nto this Part must be submitted on forms prescribed by the\ncommissioner. (4)\n\nSubmission of\napplications. Applications must be submitted as described in this section and\nsection\n373-1.3\n(c)-(h)\nof\nthis Subpart to the regional permit administrator in the region in which the\nfacility is located or proposed. An application for a Part 373 permit for a new\nhazardous waste management facility may be filed any time after promulgation of\nthe standards in Subpart 373-2 of this Part, however, all applications must be\nsubmitted at least 180 days before physical construction is expected to\ncommence. (5)\n\nSignatories to permit\napplications and reports. (i) Applications. All permit applications must be signed as follows: (a) for a corporation: by a responsible\ncorporate officer. For the purpose of this section, a\nresponsible\ncorporate officer\nmeans: (1)\na\npresident, secretary, treasurer or vice-president of the corporation in charge\nof a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar\npolicy or decisionmaking functions for the corporation; or\n(2)\nthe manager of one or more manufacturing, production or operating facilities employing more than 250 persons or having\ngross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25 million (in second-quarter\n1980 dollars), if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to\nthe manager in accordance with corporate procedures; (b) for a partnership or sole proprietorship: by a general partner or the proprietor, respectively; or\n(c) for a municipality, State, Federal or\nother public agency: by either a principal executive officer or ranking elected\nofficial. For purposes of this section, a\nprincipal executive\nofficer\nof a governmental agency includes: (1)\nthe chief executive officer of the\nagency; or\n(2)\na senior executive\nofficer having responsibility for the overall operations of a principal\ngeographic unit of the agency. (ii)\n\nReports. All reports required by permits\nand other information requested by the commissioner must be signed by a person\ndescribed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, or by a duly authorized\nrepresentative of that person. A person is a duly authorized representative\nonly if: (a) the authorization is made in\nwriting by a person described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; (b) the authorization specifies either an\nindividual or a position having responsibility for overall operation of the\nregulated facility or activity, such as the position of plant manager, operator\nof a well or a well field, superintendent, or position of equivalent\nresponsibility (a duly authorized representative may thus be either a named\nindividual or any individual occupying a named position); and\n(c) the written authorization is submitted to\nthe commissioner. (iii)\n\nChanges to authorization. If an authorization under subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has\nresponsibility for the overall operation of the facility, a new authorization\nsatisfying the requirements of subparagraph (ii) must be submitted to the\ncommissioner prior to or together with any reports, information or applications\nto be signed by an authorized representative. (iv)\n\nCertification. (a) Any person signing a document under\nsubparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph shall make the following\ncertification: \"I certify under penalty of law that this document and\nall attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision according to a\nsystem designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate\nthe information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who\nmanage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the\ninformation, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and\nbelief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant\npenalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine\nand imprisonment for knowing violations.\"\n(b) For remedial action plans (RAPs) under\nsection\n373-1.11\nof this Subpart, if the\noperator certifies according to clause (\na\n) of this\nsubparagraph, then the owner may choose to make the following certification\ninstead of the certification in clause (\na\n) of this\nsubparagraph: \"Based on my knowledge of the conditions of the property\ndescribed in the RAP and my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the\nsystem referenced in the operator's certification, or those persons directly\nresponsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the\nbest of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that\nthere are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the\npossibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.\"\n(b) Completeness. Prior to commencing review of any application, the\ncommissioner must determine that the application is complete. However, the\ncommissioner may deny a permit for the active life of a hazardous waste\nmanagement facility or unit before receiving a complete application for a\npermit. In order for an application to be determined complete, the applicant\nmust: (1)\nsatisfy the general\nrequirements for complete applications contained in Part 621 of this Title\n(Uniform Procedures Regulations); (2)\ninclude all information required, both\ngeneral and specific to the type of facility under this Part; (3)\ninclude any supplemental information\nrequested by the commissioner in a notice of incompleteness; and\n(4)\nsubmit the exposure information described\nin section\n373-1.5\n(d)(10) and\n(h)(10)\nof this Subpart. (c) Siting certificate\nrequirements.

(d) Draft permits for RCRA delegated\npermits. (1)\n\nIn the case of RCRA\ndelegated permits, once an application is complete, the commissioner will issue\na draft permit or a notice of intent to deny the application. (2)\nA draft permit shall contain the\nfollowing information: (i) all permit\nconditions applicable to the specific facility as set forth in section\n373-1.6\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart; (ii)\nall monitoring\nrequirements set forth in section\n373-1.6\n(b); (iii)\nall required conditions as set forth in\nsection\n373-1.6\n(c); and\n(iv)\nall compliance schedule\nrequirements set forth in section\n373-1.6\n(d). (3)\n\nAll draft permits prepared\nunder this subdivision shall be accompanied by a statement of basis or fact\nsheet based on the administrative record publicly noticed and made available\nfor public comment as set forth in Part 621 of this Title. (e) Statement of basis. The department shall prepare a statement of basis for\nevery draft permit for which a fact sheet under subdivision (f) of this section\nis not prepared. The statement of basis shall briefly describe the derivation\nof the conditions of the draft permit and the reasons for them or, in the case\nof notices of intent to deny or terminate, reasons supporting the tentative\ndecision. The statement of basis shall be sent to the applicant and, on\nrequest, to any other person. (f) Fact sheet. (1)\nA fact sheet shall be prepared for every\ndraft permit for a major HWM facility and for every draft permit which the\ncommissioner finds is the subject of widespread public interest or raises major\nissues. The fact sheet shall briefly set forth the principal facts and the\nsignificant factual, legal, methodological and policy questions considered in\npreparing the draft permit. The commissioner shall send this fact sheet to the\napplicant and, on request, to any other person. (2)\n\nThe fact sheet shall include, when\napplicable: (i) a brief description of the\ntype of facility or activity which is the subject of the draft\npermit; (ii)\nthe type and quantity\nof wastes, fluids or pollutants which are proposed to be or are being treated, stored, disposed of, injected, emitted or discharged; (iii)\na brief summary of the basis for the\ndraft permit conditions, including references to applicable statutory or\nregulatory provisions and appropriate supporting references to the\nadministrative record; (iv)\nreasons\nwhy any requested variances or alternatives to required standards do or do not\nappear justified; (v) a description\nof the procedures for reaching a final decision on the draft permit, including: (a) the beginning and ending dates of the\ncomment period and the address where comments will be received; (b) procedures for requesting a hearing and\nthe nature of that hearing; and\n(c) any other procedures by which the public may participate in the final decision; and\n(vi)\nname and\ntelephone number of a person to contact for additional information. (g) Recordkeeping. Applicants must keep records of all data used to complete\npermit applications and any supplemental information submitted under sections\n373-1.3, 373-1.4\nand\n373-1.5\nof this Subpart for a\nperiod of at least three years from the date the application is\nsigned. (h) If the\ndepartment concludes, based on one or more of the factors listed in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision, that compliance with the standards of 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, as incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title, alone may not be protective of human health and/or the\nenvironment, the department will require additional information or\nassessment(s) necessary to determine whether additional controls are necessary\nto ensure protection of human health and the environment. This includes\ninformation necessary to evaluate the potential risk to human health and/or the\nenvironment resulting from both direct and indirect exposure pathways. The\ndepartment may also require a permittee or applicant to provide information\nnecessary to determine whether such an assessment(s) should be required. (1)\n\nThe department will base the evaluation\nof whether compliance with the standards of 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, as\nincorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title, alone is protective of human health and the environment on\nfactors relevant to the potential risk from a hazardous waste combustion unit, including, as appropriate, any of the following factors: (i) particular site-specific considerations\nincluding unique dispersion patterns, proximity to receptors (such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, day care centers, parks, community activity centers, or other potentially sensitive receptors), and other relevant\nconsiderations; (ii)\nidentities and\nquantities of emissions of persistent, bioaccumulative or toxic pollutants\nconsidering enforceable controls in place to limit those pollutants; (iii)\nidentities and quantities of non-dioxin\nproducts of incomplete combustion most likely to be emitted and to pose\nsignificant risk based on known toxicities (confirmation of which should be\nmade through emissions testing); (iv)\nidentities and quantities of other\noff-site sources of pollutants in proximity of the facility that significantly\ninfluence interpretation of a facility-specific risk assessment; (v) presence of significant ecological\nconsiderations, such as the proximity of a particularly sensitive ecological\narea; (vi)\nvolume and types of\nwastes, for example wastes containing highly toxic constituents; (vii)\nother on-site sources of hazardous air\npollutants that significantly influence interpretation of the risk posed by the\noperation of the source in question; (viii)\nadequacy of any previously conducted\nrisk assessment, given any subsequent changes in conditions likely to affect\nrisk; and\n(ix)\nsuch other factors\nas may be appropriate. (i) The commissioner may require a permittee\nor an applicant to submit information in order to establish permit conditions\nunder section\n373-1.6\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
