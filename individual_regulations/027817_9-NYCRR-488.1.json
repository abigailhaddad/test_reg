  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 488.1 - Leave for ordinary disability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All sworn members of the New York State\n\nPolice, regardless of rank or assignment, must at all times be capable of\nstrenuous physical duty and must be physically and mentally fit to perform the\nduties required of members of the State Police. (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of\nthis section, if the superintendent or his designee reasonably determines that\nthe continued presence of a member on the job represents a potential danger to\npersons, including such member, or property, or would unreasonably interfere\nwith operations, the superintendent may immediately place such member on\ninvoluntary leave of absence. The employee shall be entitled to draw all\naccumulated unused sick leave, vacation, and other time allowances to which he\nor she is entitled. As soon as possible after the employee is involuntarily\nplaced on leave of absence, the superintendent shall proceed as provided in\nsubdivision (c) of this section. If the superintendent or his designee\nthereafter finally determines the member is physically and mentally fit to\nperform the duties of a member of the New York State Police, the member shall\nbe restored to his or her position and any leave credits or salary lost because\nof such involuntary leave of absence shall be restored to the member. (c) When, in the judgment of the\n\nSuperintendent of State Police or his designee, a member of the New York State\n\nPolice is unable to perform the duties required of all members of the State\n\nPolice by reason of a physical or mental disability, the superintendent or his\ndesignee shall follow the procedures as set out below: (1)\n\nStep I. The superintendent or his\ndesignee may require such member to undergo one or more medical, psychological\nor psychiatric evaluations conducted by one or more medical personnel selected\nand paid by the Division of State Police. Prior to such medical, psychological\nor psychiatric evaluations, the members shall be provided with a written\nstatement of the basis for the judgment of the superintendent that the member\nis unable to perform the duties required of members of the New York State\n\nPolice. (2)\n\nStep II. Upon review of\nthe reports of such medical, psychological or psychiatric evaluations, and\nother available information, the superintendent or his designee shall determine\nwhether such member should be placed on leave of absence. If the superintendent\nor his designee determines that the member shall be placed on leave of absence, the member shall be so notified in writing. The notice of leave of absence\nshall contain a written statement of the reasons therefor, shall specify the\ndate on which the leave is to commence and shall advise the member of his or\nher rights as provided in this section. The notice shall be served in person or\nsent by first class mail, return receipt requested, to the member at his last\nknown address. (3)\n\nStep III. A\nmember so placed on leave of absence may, within 10 business days from service\nof such notice, object to the imposition of the proposed leave of absence and\nrequest a hearing. Such request for a hearing shall be in writing and forwarded\nto the superintendent through channels. Failure to file a timely request shall\nconstitute waiver of the right to a hearing. Upon receipt of a written request\nfor a hearing, the superintendent shall provide the member, through his or her\nlegal representative, if any, copies of diagnoses, test results, recorded\nobservations, or other data supporting the proposed leave of absence, imposition of which will be held in abeyance pending final determination by the\nsuperintendent or his designee after a hearing except under circumstances as\nprovided in subdivision (b) of this section. (4)\n\nStep IV. Upon timely request, the\nsuperintendent shall afford the member a hearing as soon as practicable after\nreceipt of the request for a hearing. The hearing shall be held before a State\n\nPolice commissioned officer holding the rank of staff inspector or higher, such\nhearing officer to be chosen by the superintendent or his designee. In all\ncases, the hearing officer shall be of higher rank than the member requesting\nthe hearing. The member may be represented at the hearing by counsel or a\nrepresentative of a certified or recognized employee organization. The employee\nshall be entitled to reasonable time to obtain said representation. The member\nmay present medical experts and other witnesses or evidence. The Division of\n\nState Police shall have the burden of proving unfitness for duty by substantial\nevidence. Compliance with technical rules of evidence shall not be required. Testimony at the hearing shall be recorded. The hearing officer shall make a\nwritten report of his findings and recommendations, which shall be referred to\nthe superintendent, together with the record, for final review and decision. At\nthe conclusion of the hearing, the member may request to have the final\ndecision of the superintendent rendered without the transcript of the\ntestimony. Such request shall be on-the-record and in writing, and it shall be\nrestricted to waiver of the requirement that the transcript of testimony be\navailable to the superintendent before his final decision. If such member\nshould subsequently petition for a judicial review of the superintendent's\ndecision under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR), he shall\nbe furnished with a copy of the transcript of testimony without\ncharge. (5)\n\nStep V. The\nsuperintendent or his designee shall render a final written determination as\nsoon as practicable after receipt of the hearing officer's report and shall\nprovide the member with a copy of such determination. The superintendent may\neither uphold the original proposed notice of leave of absence, withdraw such\nnotice, or modify the notice as appropriate. An employee placed on leave of\nabsence pursuant to these procedures shall be entitled to draw all accumulated, unused sick leave, annual leave, personal leave, or other time allowances\nstanding to his or her credit. (d) When a member, who is absent due to\ninjury, disease, or other disability, whether incurred on- or off-duty, shall\nseek to return to duty, and in the judgment of the superintendent or his\ndesignee such member may not possess the physical or mental fitness required of\nall members of the State Police, the superintendent shall follow the procedure\nset forth in subdivision (c) of this section, provided that the superintendent\nmay elect not to restore such member to duty pending the outcome of such\nprocedures. (e) If a member shall\nfail to attend a scheduled physical, psychological or psychiatric evaluation or\nshall fail to cooperate with an evaluating medical officer without just cause, as determined by the superintendent or his designee, the superintendent or his\ndesignee may nevertheless determine that the member is physically or mentally\nunfit to perform the duties of a member of the New York State Police, in which\ncase the superintendent or his designee may immediately place the member on\nleave of absence. The employee shall be entitled to draw all accumulated unused\nsick leave, vacation, and other time allowances to which he or she is entitled. Thereafter, such member may elect to proceed as set forth in subdivision (c) of\nthis section, provided that the superintendent may elect to continue such\nemployee on leave of absence pending such proceedings. (f) If a member placed on leave pursuant to\nthis section is not reinstated within one year after he or she has exhausted\nall accumulated, unused sick leave, annual leave, personal leave or other time\nallowances to which he or she is entitled, his or her employment status may be\nterminated. If a member's disability, in the judgment of the superintendent, permanently incapacitates him or her from performing his or her duties, such\nmember's employment status may be terminated once he or she has exhausted\naccumulated, unused sick leave, annual leave, personal leave or other time\nallowances to which he or she is entitled. (g) A member placed on leave pursuant to this\nsection may, until one year after his employment status is terminated, make\napplication to the superintendent for restoration or reinstatement to active\nduty. Upon receiving such a request, the superintendent may direct that the\nmember undergo such medical, psychological or psychiatric evaluations as may be\nnecessary, to be conducted by medical personnel selected by the superintendent. Upon review of the records of such evaluations, and other available\ninformation, the superintendent shall evaluate the case and as soon as\npracticable provide the member with written notice of his determination whether\nto permit the member to return to his or her duties. (h) In the event that the superintendent\ndetermines pursuant to this section that a member making application for\nrestoration or reinstatement to duty is fit therefor, but no appropriate\nvacancies shall exist to which such reinstatement may be made, or if the\nworkload does not warrant the filing of such vacancy, the member's name shall\nbe placed on a preferred list for his or her former position, and he or she\nshall be eligible for reinstatement in his or her former job title from such\npreferred list for a period of up to three years from the date of termination\nof his or her employment status. (i) Nothing contained herein shall be\nconstrued to prohibit the superintendent or his designee, or the member or a\nperson acting on his or her behalf from filing for State Police disability\nretirement pursuant to Retirement and Social Security Law, section 336-b at any\ntime. (j) This section shall not be\nconstrued to require the extension of any employment beyond the time at which\nit would otherwise terminate by operation of law, rule or regulation, nor shall\nthis section be deemed to modify or supersede any other provisions of law\napplicable to the reemployment of persons retired from public service on\naccount of disability.
