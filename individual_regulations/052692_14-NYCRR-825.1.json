  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 825.1 - Background and Intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Physical and\nbehavioral health conditions (i.e., mental illness and/or substance use\ndisorders) often occur at the same time. Persons with behavioral disorders\nfrequently experience chronic illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. These illnesses can be prevented and are\ntreatable. However, barriers to primary care, as well as the difficulty in\nnavigating complex healthcare systems, are a major obstacle to individuals with\nbehavioral health disorders seeking treatment for their physical conditions. Primary care settings have, at the same time, become a gateway to the\nbehavioral health system, as people seek care for mild to moderate behavioral\nhealth needs (e.g., anxiety, depression, or substance use) in primary health\ncare settings. Health care providers have long recognized that many patients\nhave both physical and behavioral health care needs, yet physical and\nbehavioral healthcare services have traditionally been provided and paid for\nseparately. Even behavioral health services have traditionally been treated in\na bifurcated system (e.g. substance use disorder treatment is treated\nseparately from mental health treatment). (b) The term \"integrated care\" describes the\nsystematic coordination of primary and behavioral health care services. The\ngrowing awareness of the prevalence and cost of comorbid physical and\nbehavioral health conditions, and the increased recognition that integrated\ncare can improve outcomes and achieve savings, has led to increasing acceptance\nof delivery models that integrate physical and behavioral health care. Moreover, most patients prefer to have their physical and behavioral health\ncare delivered in one place, by the same team of clinicians. (c) Accordingly, these regulations will\nprescribe standards for the integration of physical and behavioral health care\nservices in certain outpatient programs licensed by the Department of Health, the Office of Mental Health, and/or the Office of Alcoholism and Substance\n\nAbuse Services.
