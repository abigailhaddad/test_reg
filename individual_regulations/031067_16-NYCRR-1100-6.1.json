If there is any discrepancy between an exhibit\nor compliance filing and a permit condition, the permittee shall comply with\nthe permit condition and notify the Office immediately for\nresolution. (b) Property\n\nRights. Issuance of a siting permit does not convey any rights or\ninterests in public or private property. The permittee shall be responsible for\nobtaining all real property, rights-of-way (ROW), access rights and other\ninterests or licenses in real property required for the construction and\noperation of the facility. (c) Eminent Domain. Issuance of a siting permit to a permittee\nthat is an entity in the nature of a merchant generator and not in the nature\nof a fully regulated public utility company with an obligation to serve\ncustomers does not constitute a finding of public need for any particular\nparcel of land such that a condemner would be entitled to an exemption from the\nprovisions of article 2 of the New York State Eminent Domain Procedure Law\n(\"EDPL\") pursuant to section 206 of the EDPL. (d) Other Permits and\n\nApprovals. Prior to the permittee's commencement of construction, the\npermittee shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary federal and\nfederally-delegated permits and any other approvals that may be required for\nthe facility and which the Office is not empowered to provide or has expressly\nauthorized. In addition, the Office expressly authorizes: (1)\n\nThe PSC to require approvals, consents, permits, other conditions for the construction or operation of the facility\nunder PSL sections 68, 69, 70, and article VII, as applicable, with the\nunderstanding that the PSC will not duplicate any issue already addressed by\nthe Office and will instead only act on its police power functions related to\nthe entity as described in the body of this siting permit; (2)\n\nThe NYSDOT to administer permits\nassociated with oversize/overweight vehicles and deliveries, highway work\npermits, and associated use and occupancy approvals as needed to construct and\noperate the facility; and\n(3)\n\nThe\npertinent agency to implement the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and\n\nBuilding Code.

(g) Notice to\n\nProceed with Construction. The permittee and its contractors shall not\ncommence construction until a \"Notice to Proceed with Construction\" has been\nissued by the Office. Such Notice will be issued promptly after all applicable\npre-construction compliance filings have been filed by the permittee and\napproved by the Office. The Notice will not be unreasonably withheld. The\n\nOffice may issue a conditional \"Notice to Proceed with Site Preparation\" for\nthe removal of trees, stumps, shrubs and vegetation from the facility site as\nindicated on Office-approved site clearing plans to clear the facility site for\nconstruction, as well as setting up and staging of the laydown yard(s), including bringing in equipment, prior to the submission of all\npre-construction compliance filings. (h) Expiration. The siting\npermit will automatically expire if the facility does not achieve commencement\nof commercial operation within seven (7) years from the date of\nissuance. (i) Partial\n\nCancellation. If the permittee decides not to commence construction of\nany portion of the facility, it shall so notify the Office promptly after\nmaking such decision. Such decisions shall not require a modification to the\nsiting permit unless the Office determines that such change constitutes a major\nmodification to the siting permit pursuant to section 1100-11.1 of this\n\nPart. (j) Deadline\n\nExtensions. The Office may extend any deadlines established by the\nsiting permit for good cause shown. Any request for an extension shall be in\nwriting, include a justification for the extension, and be filed at least\nfourteen (14) business days prior to the applicable deadline. (k) Office Authority. The\npermittee shall regard NYSDPS staff, authorized pursuant to PSL section 66(8), as the Office's representatives in the field. In the event of any emergency\nresulting from the specific construction or maintenance activities that\nviolate, or may violate, the terms of the siting permit, compliance filings or\nany other supplemental filings, such NYSDPS staff may issue a stop work order\nfor that location or activity pursuant to section 1100-12.1 of this\n\nPart.
