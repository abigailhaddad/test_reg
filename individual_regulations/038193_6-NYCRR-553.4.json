  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 553.4 - Exceptions\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhere in its opinion there exists good and sufficient\nreason to permit an exception to the well spacing provisions of sections\n553.1, 553.2\nand\n553.3\nof this Part, the department\nmay permit reasonable well location exceptions which will protect correlative\nrights and prevent waste. Any application for such an exception shall be made\nin writing in triplicate as a separate attachment to the application for permit\nas outlined in section\n552.1\nof this Title and shall set\nforth in ample detail the reason or reasons for such exception request. Upon\nreceipt of this exception request, the department shall promptly schedule a\npublic hearing to facilitate a decision on the application. When a location\nexception is granted, the department may adjust the production from such well\nor take such other action as it may deem necessary for the protection of\ncorrelative rights or to prevent waste. Departmental Order\n\nIn the Matter of Considering the Establishment of Drilling\n\nUnits in the Oriskany\nand Reef Gas Pools of the Wyckoff Field in Steuben\n\nCounty\n\nThe Conservation Department of the State of New York does\nhereby order as follows: 1. Contiguous\nspacing units of 160 acres, more or less, subject to an accurate survey, are\nhereby established for the production of gas from the Oriskany and Reef Pools\nunderlying the said Wyckoff Field. 2. Such spacing units shall as nearly as\npossible conform to those delineated on the map below, hereby, made a part of\nthis order, except that minor variances may be granted by the department to\ncorrect any errors that may exist in said map or to simplify spacing unit\nformation and/or operations. 3. All\nindicated spacing unit boundaries coinciding with property lines, roads, or\nextensions thereof, will continue to remain so and all adjustments that may be\nnecessary will be made on spacing unit boundaries that do not coincide with\nsuch established features. 4. The\ndepartment reserves the right to decide what constitutes a minor variance and\nthe right to grant or deny such variance. 5. The single permitted well in each spacing\nunit may be drilled at any point within an approximate 40-acre area in the\ncenter of the unit, but in no case nearer than 660 feet to any boundary of the\nunit, subject however, to the restrictions contained in section\n553.2\nof the rules and regulations\nof the department applicable thereto. 6. Unless otherwise agreed, pursuant to\nsection 78 of the Conservation Law or ordered pursuant to section 79 of said\nlaw, the owner of each royalty interest within any spacing unit shall\nparticipate in the royalty income from the unit well in the relation that the\nacreage owned by him bears to the total acreage in such unit. 7. In the absence of any agreement to the\ncontrary or an order pursuant to section 79 of the Conservation Law, the party\nholding the largest percentage of working interest in a spacing unit will be\nconsidered the operator thereof. 8. It will be the operator's responsibility to identify by accurate survey, the\nspacing unit boundaries and fractional acreages therein; to set forth the\nparticipation factors of the working and royalty interests and to file a formal\nunit declaration thereof with the Division of Oil and Gas in the Conservation\n\nDepartment and, as a matter of record, at the Steuben County\n\nCourthouse. 9. If all of the\nworking interests in any spacing unit fail to agree upon a plan for the\ndevelopment and operation thereof, including their participation factors, or if\nany royalty interests which have not granted the necessary pooling powers to\nthe working interests fail to agree on their participation factors, such unit\nshall not be developed, any gas produced or sold therefrom, unless the proceeds\nof all such production are paid into escrow pending final determination of a\nproceeding under section 79 of the Conservation Law and any judicial review\nthereof. 10. All wells shall be\ncompleted in such manner that there will be no commingling of gas from the\n\nOriskany and Reef Pools below the surface of the ground. 11. If a well is completed in a manner\npermitting simultaneous production from the Oriskany and Reef Pools, the well\nhead assembly and connections must be such as will permit individual testing of\nthe pools. 12. The department will\nestablish additional spacing units at the perimeter of those delineated on the\nattached map if future drilling so requires. 13. The existing four wells and their\nrespective spacing units will be subject to all phases of this order. 14. This order shall be effective\nimmediately. [Filed July 19, 1968]\nImage\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
