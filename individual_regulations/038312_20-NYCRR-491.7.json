  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 491.7 - Corrected licenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 528(a), (b)\n(a) Any change relating to the information\nshown in an application for a New York State fuel use tax license or an IFTA\nlicense, as the case may be, must immediately be reported, in writing, to the\ndepartment. Thus, for example, any change in a carrier's name, address, or\nownership of its business or qualified motor vehicles must be so reported. The\ndepartment will evaluate the information submitted and will make a\ndetermination as to whether a corrected New York State fuel use tax license or\nIFTA license should be issued. If the department concludes that a corrected\nlicense is necessary, such license will be issued to the carrier. If, however, such a change is so significant as to require the immediate surrender of a\ncarrier's existing New York State fuel use tax license or IFTA license and the\ndestruction of a carrier's decal(s), the provisions of section\n491.8\nof this Part shall apply. (b) The\ndepartment may prescribe a form or forms upon which changes are to be reported, and upon which applications are to be made for corrected licenses. In the\nabsence of such prescribed forms, a carrier may notify the department of any\nchanges by letter that clearly identify the carrier by name, address and\ntaxpayer identification number. The notification must also explain the subject\nchanges and the nature of the subject changes. (c) A corrected license will not be deemed to\nbe issued nor shall such license become effective, until the superseded license\nhas been surrendered to the department. No new decals are required to accompany\ncorrected licenses. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n491.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
