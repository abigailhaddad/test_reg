Tit. 6 § 233.4 - Testing and monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner\nand/or operator of a pharmaceutical or cosmetic manufacturing process must\nfollow notification requirements, protocol requirements and test procedures of\n\nPart 202 of this Title for testing and monitoring of these processes. (b) The test procedures to determine\ncompliance must be approved by the commissioner and be consistent with Appendix\nA\nof part 60 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). Depending\nupon conditions at a test site, one of the following test methods from appendix\nA of 40 CFR\n60\n(see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) must be used\nto determine volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations of a gas stream at\nthe inlet and outlet of a control device: (1)\n\nMethod 18, Measurement of Gaseous Organic Compound Emissions by Gas\n\nChromatography. (2)\n\nMethod 25, Determination of Total Gaseous Organic Emissions as Carbon. (3)\n\nMethod 25A, Determination of Total\n\nGaseous Organic Concentration Using a Flame Ionization Analyzer. (4)\n\nMethods not listed above must be approved\nin advance by the department's representative and the United States\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. (c) Any facility which is not subject to the\ncontrol requirements of this Part because its annual potential to emit volatile\norganic compounds are below the applicability levels, must maintain records in\na format acceptable to the commissioner's representative that verify the\nfacility's annual potential to emit VOC. Upon request, these records must be\nsubmitted to the department. (d) If\nan air cleaning device is used, continuous monitors for the following\nparameters must be installed, periodically calibrated, and operated at all\ntimes that the associated process equipment and control equipment are\noperating: (1)\nan exhaust gas temperature of\nall incinerators; (2)\ntemperature\nrise across a catalytic incinerator bed; (3)\nbreakthrough of volatile organic\ncompounds on a carbon adsorption unit; and\n(4)\noutlet gas temperature of a refrigerated\ncondenser; (5)\ntemperature of\nnonrefrigerated condenser coolant supply system; or\n(6)\nany other continuous monitoring or\nrecording device required by the commissioner for the purpose of demonstrating\ncompliance with the control requirements of this Part. (e) Each monitor must be equipped with a\nrecording device. (f) Each monitor\nmust be calibrated quarterly. (g) Each monitor must operate at all times while the associated control equipment\nis operating. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n233.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
