  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 40.2 - Rules for allocation\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Part, the amount of\nthe taxpayer's section 183 tax that is subject to the surcharge imposed by\nsection\n183-a\nof the Tax Law is determined by\nmultiplying its section 183 tax by a fraction, expressed as a percentage. Where\nthe taxpayer's business activity is wholly conducted in the MCTD, the\npercentage is 100 percent. The numerator of the fraction is the average gross\nassets of the taxpayer employed in any business within the MCTD and the\ndenominator of the fraction is the average gross assets of the taxpayer\nemployed in any business within New York State. Gross assets consisting of\ntrucks and other rolling equipment of corporations principally engaged in\ntrucking are located within the MCTD in accordance with the ratio that the\nmileage of such trucks and other rolling equipment traveled within the MCTD\nbears to the mileage of such trucks and other rolling equipment traveled within\n\nNew York State. Obligations issued by the United States and cash on hand and on\ndeposit are excluded from both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. The average gross assets used in determining such fraction shall be the assets\nemployed during the year preceding the privilege period for the section 183 tax\nupon which the tax surcharge is based. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n40.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
