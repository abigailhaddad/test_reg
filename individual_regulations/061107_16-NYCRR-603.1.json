(b) As indicated by their\nwording, a number of the regulations in this Part prescribe the normal\nprocedures and practices to be directed in good faith by the service provider. However, the regulations in this Part are not intended to govern the\nimplementation of such procedures in individual instances.

They do not establish\na level of performance to be achieved during periods of emergency, catastrophe, natural disaster, severe storm or other events affecting large numbers of\nconsumers nor shall they apply to extraordinary or abnormal conditions of\noperation, such as those resulting from work stoppage, civil unrest, major\ntransportation disruptions or other events beyond a service provider's\ncontrol.
