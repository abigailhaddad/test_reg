  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4010.1 - Pools-calculation and distribution\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe pari-mutuel pools shall be calculated and\ndistributed as follows: (a) Win, place, show or daily double wagers form separate wagering pools with payoffs\ncalculated independently of each other. (b) From each pool there shall be deducted\nthe statutory percentage and the breaks, the remainder being the net pool for\ndistribution. (c) Win pool. (1)\n\nThe net pool divided by the amount\nwagered on the horse finishing first determines the payoff per dollar, including profit and wager. (2)\n\nWhen two horses finish first in a dead heat, the money in the win pool is\ndivided the same as in a place pool calculation. (d) Place pool. (1)\n\nThe amounts wagered on horses finishing\nfirst and second are deducted from the net pool to determine the profit. This\nprofit is divided in half, and the halves, in turn, divided by the two amounts\nmentioned above. This determines the profit per dollar, to which is added the\nwager. (2)\n\nWhen two horses finish\nsecond in a dead heat, one half of the profit is allocated to the tickets\nrepresenting wagers on the horse finishing first, and the remaining half is\nallocated equally to the wagers on horses finishing in the dead heat for\nsecond. (3)\n\nWhen two horses in the\nfield or coupled as an entry run first and second, the place pool shall be\ndistributed the same as in a win pool. (e) Show pool. (1)\n\nThe amounts wagered on the horses\nfinishing first, second and third are deducted from the net pool to determine\nthe profit. This profit is divided into three equal parts, and each part, in\nturn, divided by the three amounts mentioned above. This determines the profit\nper dollar, to which is added the wager. (2)\n\nWhen two horses finish third in a dead\nheat, one-third of the profit is allocated to the tickets representing wagers\non the horse finishing first, one-third to the wagers on the horse finishing\nsecond and the remaining third equally to the wagers on the horses finishing in\nthe dead heat for third. (3)\n\nWhen\ntwo horses in the field or coupled as an entry finish first or second, first\nand third or second and third, two thirds of the profit is allocated to the\ntickets representing wagers on the field of entry, and the remaining one-third\nto the wagers on the other next best placed horse. (4)\n\nWhen three horses in the field or coupled\nas an entry run first, second and third, the place and show pools shall be\ndistributed the same as a win pool. (f) When only two horses finish, the show\npool, if any, shall be distributed the same as in a place pool. (g) When only one horse finishes, the place\nand show pools, if any, shall be distributed the same as in a win\npool. (h) In any race in which no\nhorse finishes, all money wagered on the race shall be refunded upon\npresentation and surrender of pari-mutuel tickets sold thereon. (i) Payment where no wagering on a horse in\nthe win, place or show pools: (1)\n\nIn the\nevent that there is no money wagered to win on a horse that has finished first, the pool will be refunded. (2)\n\nIn\nthe event that there is no money wagered to place on a horse that has finished\nfirst or second, the net pool will be distributed to wagers on the horse upon\nwhich money was wagered to place and which did so finish; if none, the pool\nwill be refunded. (3)\n\nIn the event\nthat there is no money wagered to show on a horse that has finished first, second or third, the net pool will be distributed to wagers on the horses upon\nwhich money was wagered to show and that did so finish, as in a place pool; if\nonly one, to wagers upon such horse as in a win pool; if none, the pool will be\nrefunded. Should these circumstances be foreseeable when a pool is closed, an\nimmediate announcement shall be made to hold all tickets because all\ncombinations are not covered. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
