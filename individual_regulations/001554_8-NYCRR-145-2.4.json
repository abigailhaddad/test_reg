  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 145-2.4 - Matriculated status\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A student\nshall be considered in matriculated status if: (1)\nthe student has filed a written\napplication for enrollment at the institution for the purpose of earning a\ndegree, diploma or certificate; (2)\nin accepting the student's application, the institution has taken into account\nthe capacity of the student to undertake a course of study and its own capacity\nto provide what instructional and other support the student needs to complete\nthe program, as required by section\n52.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle; and\n(3)\nthe institution, on\nthe basis of that demonstration has recognized the student as a candidate for\nthat degree, diploma or certificate. It shall not be necessary that the\nstudent, in addition, have passed matriculation examinations or language\nexaminations, or completed any other particular prerequisites established by\nthe school in accordance with local custom or regulation. Effective for\nacademic terms beginning after January 1, 1978, students accepted in special\nprograms for the disadvantaged may be considered matriculated on that basis\nonly if such programs are in the EOP, HEOP, SEEK, or College Discovery\ncategories, or are otherwise approved by the commissioner. (b) The student who is enrolled for courses\nsolely to complete teacher certification, licensing or other external\nrequirements, or solely for personal or cultural advancement, and who is not\nrecognized as a candidate for a degree, diploma or certificate, shall not be\nconsidered a matriculated student. (c) A student shall be considered\nmatriculated only if the courses pursued by the student are fully recognized at\nthat time as contributing towards fulfillment by the student of the\nrequirements for completion of the program. A student required to complete\ncertain courses to make up deficiencies in background or training may be\nconsidered matriculated if acceptance and credit are not conditioned upon\nadditional and special requirements designed to establish the qualifications of\nthe student to pursue the program successfully. However, if credit is\nconditional, depending upon satisfactory completion of certain special and\nadditional requirements, then the student shall not be considered to be fully\nmatriculated. (d) Retroactive\nmatriculation by the school shall not establish retroactive eligibility for\nstudent aid unless such retroactive action was necessary to correct clerical\nerror or administrative delay in reviewing the application of a student who was\nin fact eligible for matriculation as of the retroactive date. (e) Students enrolled in a degree granting\ninstitution other than the institution in which they are matriculated must be\ncertified as eligible for tuition assistance by the matriculating institution. The courses and program of study at the attending institution must be\nconsistent with the matriculating institution's approved program of study at\nthe time of enrollment and attendance. In order to certify eligibility for\n\nState financial aid, the matriculating institution must receive all grades and\ntuition costs from the school attended. (f) (1)\n\nMatriculated students may defer declaration of a specific major and still be\nconsidered enrolled in one or more of an institution's approved programs\nprovided that the matriculating institution approves the student's deferment. For State financial aid purposes, a student must declare a major within 30 days\nof the end of the institution's add/drop period of the sophomore year in a\n2-year program or within 30 days of the end of the add/drop period of the\njunior year of a baccalaureate program so that the student is able to complete\nthe requirements for the degree within the timeframe specified in the academic\nprogram as registered with the commissioner. Provided, however, that: (i) for four-year programs, students who\nreach their junior year status upon first-time enrollment because of college\ncredits earned during high school may declare a major when they matriculate as\na first-time college student. However, such students must declare a major\nwithin 30 days of the end of the add/drop period in the semester after the one\nwithin which the student reached their junior year status. Junior year status\nis determined by the institution. (ii)\nfor 2-year programs, students who reach\ntheir sophomore year status upon first-time enrollment because of college\ncredits earned during high school may declare a major when they matriculate as\na first-time college student. However, such students must declare a major\nwithin 30 days of the end of the add/drop period of the next semester after\nreaching sophomore-year status. Sophomore year status is determined by the\ninstitution. (2)\n\nIn each\ncase, the cumulative transcript for the student must designate the student's\nenrollment in a program that has been registered by the State Education\n\nDepartment and appears on the Inventory of Registered Programs as a program\neligible for State student aid. While a declaration must be made at specified\npoints as noted above, students may change their choice of major during their\nprogram of study. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
