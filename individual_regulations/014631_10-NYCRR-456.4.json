  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 456.4 - Sampling technique\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfollowing allocation bases may be sampled for the functional reporting centers\nindicated, rather than having actual cost allocation statistics accumulated for\na full year: (1)\ndry and clean pounds\ndistributed (Laundry and Linen); (2)\nhours of service (Medical Records)\n(Medical Staff Services) (Social Services); (3)\ntime spent (Medical Director's\n\nOffice); (4)\ntotal hours of nursing\nservice (Nursing Administration); (5)\ncosted requisitions (Pharmacy) (Central\n\nService Supply); (6)\nassigned time\n(Housekeeping); and\n(7)\nthe\nallocation basis for any cost center not having direct costs, but which\nreceives indirect costs as a result of the cost-finding process. (b) The sampling plan used by the\nresidential health care facility need not conform to the strict mathematical\nconcepts inherent to statistical sampling. The recommended approach to be used\nto sample statistics used as an allocation basis is as follows: (1)\nA minimum of eight calendar weeks will be\nselected each year for the accumulation of data. (2)\n\nThese eight weeks will be representative\nof the full year. In order to achieve this, the facility will select a two-week\nblock (14 consecutive days) within each fiscal quarter for the collection of\ndata. (3)\n\nThe same two-week block\nneed not be used for all statistics. (4)\n\nDuring the testing period, actual\ncounting, weighing, etc. will be done for all shifts involved in the particular\narea. (c) Periods of\nunusual circumstances should be avoided as test weeks. The principle of\nrepresentative samples is the ultimate goal. (d) It should be noted that sampling\ntechniques may only be utilized for those statistical bases indicated above and\nonly with respect to cost allocation. Statistics utilized for the standard unit\nof measure may not be sampled. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n456.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
