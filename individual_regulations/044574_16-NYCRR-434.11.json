  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 434.11 - Special procedures during cold weather periods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Not later than August 15, 1978, each and\nevery steam corporation shall develop methods to identify all residential\nhouseholds in its service territory which require a steam service for heating\nthe premises or operating a heating system. Thereafter, such corporation shall\nmaintain the capability of identifying such residential accounts for the\npurposes of this section. (b) During the period beginning November 1st of each year and ending April 15th of\nthe following year, each steam corporation shall observe, at a minimum, the\nfollowing procedures with respect to residential customers whose steam service\nis necessary to heat the premises or operate a heating system (as used in this\nsection, the term customer means a residential customer whose steam service is\nnecessary to heat the premises or operate a heating system and includes all\ncustomers residing in dwellings not included under section\n116\nof the\n\nPublic Service Law): (1)\n\nNo such corporation\nshall terminate service to any customer unless, after service of a final notice\nof discontinuance, the corporation has attempted to communicate with the\ncustomer, or another person, 18 years of age or older, who resides with the\ncustomer at the customer's residence. At a minimum, the attempt at personal\ncontact shall include one visit at the premises by field personnel during\nnormal working hours and, in the event that personal contact is not achieved, one visit by field personnel during reasonable nonbusiness periods (6 p.m. - 9\np.m. on weekdays or 9 a.m. -5 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays). If\ncommunication with the person contacted is not possible because of an apparent\nlanguage barrier, the corporation shall take steps to assure communication\nbefore discontinuance. During the personal contacts, the corporation's\nrepresentatives shall fully explain the reasons for discontinuance and shall\nattempt to ascertain whether a serious impairment to human health may\nresult. (2)\n\nFor the purposes of\nthis Part, a serious impairment to human health is indicated if a customer or\nother person residing in the premises appears to be seriously impaired and may, because of mental or physical problems, be unable to manage his or her own\nresources, carry out activities of daily living or protect oneself from neglect\nor hazardous situations without assistance from others. Indicators of serious\nimpairment to human health include but are not limited to: (i) age, infirmity or mental\nincapacitation; (ii)\nuse of life\nsupport systems, such as dialysis machines or iron lungs; (iii)\nserious illness; (iv)\nphysical disability, including blindness\nand limited mobility; and\n(v) any\nother factual circumstances which indicate severe or hazardous health\nsituations. The above criteria are general standards and the\ncorporation's field personnel must be trained to exercise discretion, sound\njudgment and common sense in ascertaining whether a serious impairment to human\nhealth exists. Doubts should be resolved in favor of continued service. (3)\n\nNo such corporation\nshall terminate service for nonpayment where a customer or other person\nresiding in the premises exhibits a serious impairment to human health, as\ndescribed in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, unless: (i) the corporation notifies the local social\nservices commissioner orally, and within five days in writing, on forms\nprescribed or approved by the commission (Appendix 16 contains the suggested\nform), that the customer or other person residing in the premises exhibits a\nserious impairment to human health; and\n(ii)\nthe local social services commissioner, after an investigation, informs the corporation that the health-impairing\ncondition does not exist or is not serious, or that an alternative means for\nprotecting the person's health has been devised. The corporation may exercise its own discretion with\nrespect to terminating service to the customer in the event it does not receive\nan oral or written report from the local social services commissioner within 15\nbusiness days after the written referral of the matter by the corporation to\nthe commissioner. (4)\n\nIf such a corporation terminates steam\nservice to a customer because of nonpayment, and the customer or a person 18\nyears of age or older residing on the premises was not personally contacted by\nthe corporation before termination of service and has not communicated with the\ncorporation for the purpose of requesting reconnection before 12 noon on the\nday following termination of service, the corporation shall immediately attempt\nto determine, by onsite inspection, direct personal contact at the premises\nwith the residential customer or other adult person, or other reasonable\nmeasures, whether there is continuing occupancy and whether a serious\nimpairment to human health, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, exists. If the corporation determines that a customer or other person residing\nin the premises faces impairment to his or her health, it shall immediately\nrestore the steam service and the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this\nsection shall apply. If the corporation is unable to obtain personal contact\nwith the customer or an adult residing on the premises, and does not have\nreasonable grounds to believe that the customer has vacated the premises, it\nshall immediately refer the name and address of the customer to the local\ncommissioner of social services, in accordance with the procedures set forth in\nparagraph (b)(3) of this section. (5)\n\nEach such corporation shall designate an\nemployee who will serve as a liaison with local social services\ndepartments. (6)\n\nEach such\ncorporation shall file with the commission for its review the procedures to be\nfollowed by the corporation's personnel in complying with these special\nprocedures. (c) If such\ncorporation decides to disconnect steam service to a residential customer\nbecause it has established that the meter or service laterals have been\ntampered with or a theft of service has occurred, it shall attempt to\ndetermine, according to the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2)\nof this section, whether a serious impairment would result from service\ndisconnection. If such corporation ascertains that a serious impairment to\nhuman health would result, it shall observe the procedures set forth in\nparagraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section; provided, however, that the\nrequirement of continued service shall not apply in the event it is impractical\nfor such corporation to eliminate any unsafe condition. In any case where a\nserious impairment is found and the corporation terminates service to preclude\nthe continuation of an unsafe condition, it shall specially notify the local\nsocial services commissioner on the same day service is disconnected and\nrequest an immediate consideration of the case. Comment:If a utility discovers a meter tampering or theft\nsituation and determines that a serious impairment exists, it should continue\nservice, pending DSS review, provided that service can be rendered safely. For\nexample, if a utility discovers that the meter of a \"locked account\" is\nadvancing, it should, in most circumstances, be able to continue service in a\nsafe manner. In other theft cases, particularly those involving gas service, the need for rendering the condition safe may preclude the continuation of\nservice. For example, if a gas utility discovers unsafe piping, an unsafe meter\nbypass, or substantial damage to the meter, termination may be the best method\nof eliminating the unsafe condition. If the utility cannot readily repair the\nunsafe condition or, in the case of a gas company, cannot obtain access to the\npilot lights (which would have to be relit), immediate restoration of service\nwould not be practical. The utility should specifically note, in its referrals\nto DSS, those cases where heat-related service is not restored or continued so\nthat DSS may give immediate attention to them. Notes\nN.Y.
