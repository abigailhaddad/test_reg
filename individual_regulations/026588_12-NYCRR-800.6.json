(2)\n\nWritten notice to an employer shall not\nbe required where workplace violence imminent danger exists to the safety of a\nspecific employee or to the general health of a specific patient and the\nemployee reasonably believes in good faith that reporting to a supervisor would\nnot result in corrective action. (3)\n\nIf, following a referral of such matter\nto the employee's supervisor and after a reasonable opportunity to correct such\nactivity, policy or practice, the matter has not been resolved and the employee\nor the authorized employee representative still believes that a serious\nviolation of a workplace violence prevention program remains or that an\nimminent danger exists, such employee may request an inspection by notifying\nthe Commissioner of Labor of the alleged violation. Such notice and request\nshall be in writing, shall set forth with reasonable particularity the\nground(s) for the notice and shall be signed by such employee or their\nauthorized employee representative.

Such\ninspection shall be made forthwith by the commissioner. (4)\n\nThe authority of the commissioner to\ninspect premises pursuant to such employee complaint shall not be limited to\nthe alleged violation contained in such complaint. The commissioner may inspect\nany other area of the premises in which he or she has reason to believe that a\nserious violation of this section exists. (5)\n\nThe commissioner may, upon his or her own\ninitiative, conduct an inspection of any premises occupied by an employer if he\nor she has reason to believe that a violation of this section has occurred. The\ncurrent PESH administrative plan will be used for the enforcement of this\nsection, including a general schedule of inspections, which provides a rational\nadministrative basis for such inspection. (6)\n\nNo employer shall take retaliatory action\nagainst any employee because the employee exercises any right accorded him or\nher by this Part. (k) Effective dates. (1)\n\nThe employer's policy\nstatement required by subdivision (e) of this Part shall be completed within 30\ndays after the effective date of this Part.
