  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 1A.03 - Design of Traffic Control Devices\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraph 04. INSERT the following paragraphs: Option: 03A Highway agencies may develop word message signs to\nnotify road users of special regulations or to warn road users of a situation\nthat might not be readily apparent. Unlike symbol signs and colors, new word\nmessage signs may be used without the need for experimentation. Standard: 03B Any change to a word message sign that can be\nconsidered more than a minor modification (see next Option) shall be approved\nby the New York State Department of Transportation before it is\nimplemented. Option: 03C With the exception of symbols and colors, minor\nmodifications in the specific design elements of a device may be made provided\nthe essential appearance characteristics are preserved. Such minor revisions\nmay include making a word plural or singular; changing the hours listed on a\nsign; word deviations such as \"road\" for \"street\" on a sign; etc. Although the\nstandard design of symbol signs cannot be modified, it may be appropriate to\nchange the orientation of the symbol to better reflect the direction of\ntravel. Support: 03D In places where there are a significant number of\nnon-English speaking individuals in the driving population, it can be\nbeneficial to duplicate the text on certain signs in a language other than\n\nEnglish. Guidance: 03E To avoid sign clutter, the number of signs so\nduplicated should be held to a minimum; only the most critical ones should be\nreproduced. Standard: 03F The use of a sign with non-English text, with the\nexception of proper names, shall require authorization from the New York State\n\nDepartment of Transportation. Support: 03G The New York State Department of Transportation's\npolicy allows bilingual signing for guide signs and limits its use on\nregulatory and warning signs. It also encourages the use of symbol type signs\ninstead of text signs whenever possible to limit the need for bilingual\nsigning. Standard: 03H U.S. Customary standard measurements (formerly known as\n\nEnglish units) shall be used in all text messages except where a language other\nthan English is used. Option: 03I Measurements may be expressed in metric units (e.g., 10\nkm instead of 6 miles) where a language other than English is\nused. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n1A.03\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
