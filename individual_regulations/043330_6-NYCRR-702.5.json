  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 702.5 - Procedures for deriving standards and guidance values based on nononcogenic effects\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Standards\nand guidance values based on nononcogenic effects shall be calculated using\ndose-response data from scientifically valid human or animal studies. Considering factors, including but not limited to route, duration and timing of\nexposure, species, strain, nature and severity of effects, pharmacokinetics, mode-of-action, study quality and statistical significance, the dose-response\ndata deemed to be the most appropriate for evaluating potential human health\nrisks at environmental exposures shall be used as the basis of the\nvalue. (b) Standards and guidance\nvalues shall be based on the point-of-departure for the selected dose-response\ndata. (1)\n\nThe point-of-departure shall be the\nno-observed-effect level (NOEL), expressed as a dose in milligrams of substance\nper kilogram of body weight per day. Where a valid NOEL is not available, a\nlowest-observed-effect level (LOEL) may be used. (2)\n\nIf neither a NOEL or a LOEL are\navailable, an alternative point-of-departure, e.g., the 95 percent lower\nconfidence limit on the dose associated with a specified percentage of excess\nrisk (e.g., 10 percent) for a nononcogenic effect adjusted for background risk, may be used. The alternative point-of-departure shall be estimated using one of\nthe mathematical models that are appropriate for analysis of dichotomous or\ncontinuous dose-response data (e.g., power, polynomial, or linear), and shall\nbe the model that best describes the dose-response data within the range of\nexperimental observation. Statistical measures, including the Chi-squared\ngoodness-of-fit test, shall be used to determine which model best describes the\ndata. (c) The standard\nor guidance value shall be derived by extrapolating from the point-of-departure\nto the reference dose (RfD). The RfD shall be estimated by dividing the NOEL\n(or LOEL, or an alternative point-of-departure) by an uncertainty factor. The\nmagnitude of this factor shall insure that exposures at or below the reference\ndose are without appreciable risk to the human population, including children, and will generally range from 10 to 3,000. It shall account for the following\nareas of uncertainty: (1)\nLOEL to NOEL\nextrapolation (where necessary, to account for uncertainty where extrapolating\nfrom a LOEL to a NOEL); (2)\nsubchronic to chronic extrapolation (where necessary, to account for\nuncertainty where extrapolating from a less-than-chronic study NOEL (or LOEL, or other point-of-departure) to a chronic NOEL, LOEL, or other\npoint-of-departure; (3)\nanimal to\nhuman extrapolation (where necessary, to account for uncertainty where\nextrapolating from experimental animals to humans); (4)\ninter-human variability (where necessary, to account for variation in sensitivity among the human population, including\nspecial consideration of the potential sensitivity of children); and\n(5)\ndata gaps (where necessary, to account\nfor areas of scientific uncertainty in the toxicological database). (d) Standards and guidance values\nbased on chronic toxic effects shall allow no more than 20 percent of the\nreference dose to come from drinking water and shall be derived using\nage-specific body weights for a childhood exposure period (18 years or less) if\nscientific evidence is sufficient to show that children may be more sensitive\nthan adults to such effects. If such evidence is not available, a body weight\nof 70 kilograms shall be used. (e) Standards and guidance values based on acute toxic effects shall allow 20\npercent of the reference dose to come from drinking water and shall be derived\nusing a child body weight of 10 kilograms. Alternative values for percentage of\nreference dose or for body weight may be used if deemed more appropriate based\non scientific evidence. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
