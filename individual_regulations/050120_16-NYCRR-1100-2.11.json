  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 1100-2.11 - Exhibit 10: Geology, Seismology and Soils\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 10 shall contain: (a) A study of the geology, seismology, and\nsoils impacts of the facility consisting of the identification and mapping of\nexisting conditions, an impact analysis, and proposed impact avoidance and\nmitigation measures, including: (1)\nA map\ndelineating existing slopes (0-3 percent, 3-8 percent, 8-15 percent, 15-25\npercent, 2535 percent, greater than 35 percent) on and within the drainage area\npotentially influenced by the facility site and interconnections; (2)\nA proposed site plan showing existing and\nproposed contours at two-foot intervals, for the facility site and\ninterconnections, at a scale sufficient to show all proposed buildings, structures, paved and vegetative areas, and construction areas (features may be\nprovided in stand-alone mapping or included as part of site plans required in\n1100-2.6(f)(1)(i) and (ii) of this Part); (3)\nA description of excavation techniques to\nbe employed; (4)\nA description of\nthe characteristics and suitability for construction purposes of the material\nexcavated for the facility and of the deposits found at foundation level, including factors such as soil corrosivity (for both steel and concrete), bedrock competence, and subsurface hydrologic characteristics and groundwater\nlevels; analysis should be based on a geotechnical engineering report verifying\nsubsurface conditions, including the results of borings and/or test pits at a\nsubset of turbine locations (for wind facilities) or solararray locations (for\nsolar facilities) that are representative of mapped soil and bedrock formations\nwithin the facility site. Identify appropriate mitigation measures required in\nlocations with highly corrosive soils, soils with a high frost risk, and soils\nwith high shrink/swell potential. Characterize subsurface conditions where\nhydraulic horizontal directional drilling is proposed and identify all\nlocations where blasting operations will be required; (5)\nA plan describing all blasting operations\nincluding location, minimum blasting contractor qualifications, hours of\nblasting operations, estimates of amounts of rock to be blasted, warning\nmeasures, measures to ensure safe transportation, storage and handling of\nexplosives, use of blasting mats, conduct of a pre-blasting condition survey of\nnearby buildings and improvements, and coordination with local safety\nofficials, and measures to protect nearby structures and groundwater\nwells; (6)\n\nAn assessment of\npotential impacts of blasting to environmental features, above-ground\nstructures and below-ground structures such as pipelines and wells; (7)\n\nAn identification and evaluation of\nreasonable mitigation measures regarding blasting impacts, including the use of\nalternative technologies and/or location of structures, and including a plan\nfor securing compensation for damages that may occur due to blasting; (8)\nA description of the regional geology, tectonic setting and seismology of the facility site; (9)\n\nAn analysis of the expected impacts of\nconstruction and operation of the facility with respect to regional geology, including analysis of potential impacts in areas of known of anticipated karst, and a description of measures to minimize and/or mitigate risks from\nconstruction (including blasting and pile driving) in karst areas; (10)\n\nAn analysis of the impacts of typical\nseismic activity experienced in the facility site based on current seismic\nhazards maps, on the location and operation of the facility identifying\npotential receptors in the event of failure, and if the facility is proposed to\nbe located near a young fault or a fault that has had displacement in Holocene\ntime, demonstration of a suitable setback from such fault; (11)\nA map delineating soil types on the\nfacility site and interconnection sites; (12)\nA description of the characteristics and\nsuitability for construction purposes of each soil type identified above, including a description of the soil structure, texture, percentage of organic\nmatter, and recharge/infiltration capacity of each soil type and a discussion\nof any dewatering that may be necessary during construction and whether the\nfacility shall contain any facilities below grade that would require continuous\ndewatering; and\n(13)\n\nMaps, figures, and analyses delineating depth to bedrock and underlying bedrock types, including vertical profiles showing soils, bedrock, water table, and typical\nfoundation depths on the facility site, based on information to be obtained\nfrom available published maps and scientific literature, review of technical\nstudies conducted on the facility site, and on-site field observations, test\npits and/or borings as available. (b) An evaluation to determine suitable\nbuilding and equipment foundations, including: (1)\nA preliminary engineering assessment to\ndetermine the types and locations of potential foundations to be employed. The\nassessment shall investigate the suitability of such foundation types as spread\nfootings, caissons, or piles, including a statement that all such techniques\nconform to applicable building codes or industry standards; (2)\n\nIf piles are used, a description and\npreliminary calculation of the number and length of piles to be driven, the\ndaily and overall total number of hours of pile driving work to be undertaken\nto construct the facility, and an assessment of pile driving impacts on\nsurrounding properties and structures due to vibration; (3)\n\nIdentification of mitigation measures\nregarding pile driving impacts, if applicable, including a plan for securing\ncompensation for damages that may occur due to pile driving; and\n(4)\n\nAn evaluation of the vulnerability of the\nfacility site and the operation of the facility to an earthquake event and a\ntsunami event.
