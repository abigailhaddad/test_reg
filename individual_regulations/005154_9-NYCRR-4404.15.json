  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4404.15 - Calculation of odds and payoff prices\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each corporation shall operate its system\nof off-track betting so as to result in the combination before the race of all\noff-track and on-track wagers into single statewide pools. In line with such\npurpose, each off-track betting corporation shall cause all pools, as are\naccumulated by such corporation, to be transmitted to the site of the statewide\ninterface of such pool prior to the start of the race, and, in the case of\npools carried at in-state tracks, all partial pools, as may be accumulated, to\nbe transmitted to such track prior to such in-state track's first display of\nmutuel odds so that the on-track odds may accurately reflect all wagers to such\ntime. (b) If, for any reason, all\nwagers are not combined into a statewide pool before the start of the race: (1)\n\nThe payoff price shall be calculated at\nthe site of the statewide interface upon the basis of all available data at\nsuch site at the start of the race, and shall be the payoff price on- and off-\ntrack statewide. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subdivision, if such pool is exotic and\nconducted exclusively off-track, neither probable payoff prices nor the final\npayoff price shall be calculated until all statewide wagers have been\ntransmitted to and received at the site of the statewide interface. (c) (1)\n\nIf, as a result of paying the statewide\nprice, a corporation's liability for payoff and track settlements is less than\nits net pool after takeout, such difference shall be added, as most feasible, to the next available statewide net pools of the same type for the same track, unless otherwise ordered by the commission. (2)\n\nIf, as a result of paying the statewide\nprice, a corporation's liability for payoff and tract settlements will be\ngreater than its net pool after take-out, such payoff and track settlement\nnevertheless shall be made, and such loss shall not be set off against monies\ngained pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Nothing herein provided\nshall deprive any corporation, however, from independently seeking recovery of\nsuch liability from any party who may be responsible therefor. (d) This section shall, whenever\napplicable, constitute an amendment to any inconsistent provisions in any plan\nof operation of an off-track betting corporation. (e) The site of the statewide interface\nshall, in the case of wagers offered at a New York State track be that track, and in the case of other off-track wagers be operations center of the agreed\nupon off-track betting corporation or as designated by the\ncommission.
