  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 131.19 - Underground work\n\nState Regulations\n\nUnderground work shall be in accordance with the nationally\nrecognized standards, and as prescribed below. Regional offices may impose more\nstringent conditions in a permit based upon prevalent weather and traffic\nconditions. (a) Installation. (1)\n\nPavement crossings for underground\nutilities shall be accomplished by jacking, driving, drilling, boring, or\ntunneling. \"Open cut\" installation will be approved by the department only upon\na clear demonstration of necessity or other conditions which warrant such a\nprocedure. Subsurface rock formations, excessive presence of boulders, excessive and damaging skin friction during jacking operations or insufficient\nrights-of-way limits to allow jacking, driving or tunneling may constitute a\nnecessity. Where an ongoing construction contract requires pavement removal\nand/or construction of new pavement, the department may consider approving an\n\"open cut\". (2)\n\nThe edge of the\nexcavation (nearest the pavement) used for driving or jacking shall not be less\nthan 10 feet, measured laterally from the curb, or edge of shoulder at shoulder\nbreak, whichever provides more clearance. When the highway configuration or\nother circumstances preclude the minimum offset, the department may consider\napproving an alternate configuration and offset. (b) Crossover carrier pipes. (1)\n\nCrossover carrier pipes shall be designed\nto withstand all applied and/or superimposed loadings resulting from the\nroadway section, traffic, potential pipe settlements, and installation\nprocedures. Certain soil and/or site conditions may require encasement. Where a\ncathodic system is designed to be installed for the crossover carrier pipe, the\ndesign of any casing shall be so as not to diminish the desired level of\nprotection. (2)\n\nCrossover carrier\npipe design shall be site specific, based on field investigation. The design\nshall address all potential applied loads, installation methods, and loads\ninduced during installation. The preferred installation method when operating\nbelow the water table or in soft ground shall employ an earth pressure balance\nor comparable system in order to prevent flowing soil or ground loss and\npavement distress. (3)\n\nDesign of a\ncrossover carrier pipe section shall include consideration of, but not be\nlimited to the following: (i) Increased pipe\nwall thickness for the distance within the pavement plus possible additional\ndistance to allow for future highway widening. (ii)\n\nAdequate wrapping, coating or other\ntreatment to protect against corrosion. (iii)\n\nProtective jacket adequate to ensure\nthe integrity of the anti-corrosion material under installation and service\nconditions. (c) Longitudinal carrier pipes, including\nutility service connections, shall be installed outside the area of live load\ninfluence, unless there is no practical alternative. (d) Temporary pavement repairs with cold\npatch or other acceptable bituminous patching shall be placed as soon as\nbackfill is made. It shall be maintained flush with the pavement surface until\nthe backfill has been properly compacted, and permanent restoration of the\npavement surface completed. (e) Existing underground facilities shall be maintained and protected by and at the\nexpense of the permit applicant in compliance with Industrial Code Rule 53 (12\nNYCRR Part\n53\n). (f) Sheeting. Where\nexcavation is within the pavement area or when the depth of excavation is\ngreater than the distance from the edge of pavement to the edge of trench, sheeting may be required. (g) Backfill. Backfill material shall be of a quality and type acceptable to the\ndepartment and shall be compacted sufficiently to preclude future settlement of\nthe excavated area. The backfill material shall be of a quality so as not to\nblock or intercept the drainage of the subgrade. Excavations for service\nconnections shall be backfilled within two days. (1)\n\nWithin roadway. Within the roadbed limit\nof a cut section or within the embankment section, the excavation shall be\nbackfilled using approved layer thicknesses of material acceptable to the\ndepartment, to the top of the subgrade. Material shall be compacted to an\nacceptable density with approved equipment. (2)\n\nOutside roadway. The backfill for\nexcavated areas shall be compacted to an approved density with acceptable\nmaterial and upper surface maintained level with the original surface. The\nsurface shall be treated, if required, in order to leave the surface in\nessentially the same condition as it was prior to the excavation. All surplus\nmaterial and trash shall be removed and disposed of in a lawful and proper\nmanner. The work area shall not be left in an unsightly condition. (3)\n\nTrenchless installations. All detrimental\nvoids created during the installation of a crossover pipe, regardless of\nmethod, shall be filled. Appropriate backfill type and method of placement\nshall be addressed in the design of the crossing. (h) Pavement replacement. (1)\n\nTemporary pavement restoration shall\nconsist of a minimum compacted thickness of three inches of asphalt concrete, and approved base material of a depth to provide for permanent pavement. In\nsituations where heavy traffic loads are anticipated or cases where the\ntemporary pavement is required for a protracted period, more substantial\npavement and backfill design may be required. The asphalt concrete shall be\nmaintained flush with the existing pavement until permanent restoration of the\npavement. (2)\n\nPermanent pavement\nreplacement will be specified in the permit. (3)\n\nOn reinforced concrete pavements, the\nappropriate class of concrete shall be used. Undermined and broken slabs shall\nbe completely replaced. Approved joint dowels and sealer, transverse ties and\nreinforcing steel shall be used as required. (4)\n\nAsphalt concrete pavement shall be\nreplaced with adequately compacted base material, binder and top course\nmaterial which is at least equal in quality, mix type and thickness to the\npavement which was removed. Existing pavement should be saw-cut to provide a\nclean butt joint between the old and new pavement. An emulsified asphalt tack\ncoat shall be applied to all existing pavement edges prior to placing the new\nasphalt pavement courses. (5)\n\nShoulders shall be replaced with material of like quality, thickness and type\nas the existing shoulder. (6)\n\nManhole frames, grates and similar appurtenances placed within the roadway\nshall be approved by the department and shall be set in a workman-like manner\nflush with the surface of the roadway. (i) The department will not undertake or\naccept financial responsibility for any remediation or similar activity with\nrespect to the removal of hazardous wastes (6 NYCRR Parts\n373\nand\n374\n) and\nnon-hazardous solid industrial wastes (6 NYCRR Part\n360\n) which under law would\nnot be required at the time but for the accommodation of utility facilities\nwithin the right-of-way. Such responsibility and costs shall be solely those of\nthe utility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
