Tit. 20 §§ 8197-4.3 - Rescission of final special franchise assessment or full value\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a special\nequalization rate is established pursuant to Subpart 8186-3 of this Title\nfollowing the determination of the final special franchise assessment, the\nfinal special franchise assessment shall be rescinded and a new final special\nfranchise assessment shall be determined by ORPTS using the special\nequalization rate; provided, however, that if the special equalization rate was\nestablished by reason of the completion of a revaluation which had not been\nexpected when the tentative special franchise assessment had been determined, the final special franchise assessment shall be rescinded and a new tentative\nspecial franchise full value shall be determined pursuant to this\n\nSubpart. (b) If ORPTS determines\nthat there has been an error in the establishment of a final special franchise\nassessment or full value due to a mathematical error or an incorrect inventory\nor an incorrect application of a valuation component and that such error or\nerrors results in an assessment or full value that is more than 10 percent\ndifferent from what the assessment or full value should have been if properly\nestablished, ORPTS may establish a new tentative assessment or full value at\nany time within six months of the establishment of that incorrect assessment or\nfull value.
