(1)\n\nWhat definitions\napply to this section? This section uses the following special definitions: (i) Agreement state\nmeans a\nstate, such as New York State, that has entered into an agreement with the NRC\nunder subsection 274b of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. as amended (68 Stat. 919), as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e)(7)\nof\nthis Title, to assume responsibility for regulating within its borders\nbyproduct, source, or special nuclear material in quantities not sufficient to\nform a critical mass. (ii)\n\nCertified delivery\nmeans certified mail with return receipt\nrequested, or equivalent courier service, or other means, that provides the\nsender with a receipt confirming delivery. (iii)\n\nDepartment\nrefers to\nthe definition in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (iv)\n\nEligible\nnaturally occurring and/or accelerator-produced radioactive material\n(NARM)\nis NARM that is eligible for the transportation and disposal\nconditional exemption. It is a NARM waste that contains RCRA hazardous waste, meets the waste acceptance criteria of, and is allowed by State NARM\nregulations to be disposed of at a low-level radioactive waste disposal\nfacility (LLRWDF) licensed in accordance with 10 CFR part\n61\nor NRC agreement\nstate equivalent regulations. (v) Exempted waste\nmeans a waste that meets the eligibility\ncriteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and meets all of the conditions in\nparagraph (b)(3) of this section, or meets the eligibility criteria in\nparagraph (i)(1) of this section and complies with all the conditions in\nparagraph (j)(1) of this section. Such waste is conditionally exempted from the\nregulatory definition of hazardous waste described in section\n371.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. (vi)\n\nHazardous\nwaste\nmeans any material which is defined to be hazardous waste in\naccordance with section\n371.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle, \"Definition of hazardous waste.\"\n(vii)\n\nLand disposal restriction (LDR)\ntreatment standards\nmeans treatment standards, under Part 376 of this\n\nTitle, that a RCRA hazardous waste must meet before it can be disposed of in a\nRCRA hazardous waste land disposal unit. (viii)\n\nLicense\nmeans a\nlicense as defined in section\n380-2.1\nof this Title. (ix)\n\nLow-level mixed waste\n(LLMW)\nis a waste that contains both low-level radioactive waste and\nRCRA hazardous waste. (x) Low-level radioactive waste (LLW)\nis a radioactive waste which\ncontains source, special nuclear, or byproduct material, and which is not\nclassified as high-level radioactive waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear\nfuel, or byproduct material as defined in section 11e(2) of the Atomic Energy\n\nAct. (See also definition in section\n382.2\nof this Title.)\n(xi)\n\nMixed waste\nmeans a\nwaste that contains both RCRA hazardous waste and source. special nuclear, or\nbyproduct material subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as\namended. (xii)\n\nNaturally\noccurring and/or accelerator-produced radioactive material (NARM)\nmeans radioactive materials that: (a) are\nnaturally occurring and are not source, special nuclear, or byproduct materials\n(as defined by the AEA); or\n(b) are\nproduced by an accelerator. NARM is regulated in New York State under State\nlaw, or by DOE (as authorized by the AEA) under DOE orders. (xiii)\nNRC\nmeans\nthe U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. (xiv)\n\nWe\nor\nus\nwithin this section, means the department as defined in\nsection\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (xv)\n\nYou\nmeans a generator, treater, or other handler of low-level mixed waste or\neligible NARM. (b) Storage and treatment conditional\nexemption and eligibility. (1)\n\nWhat\ndoes a storage and treatment conditional exemption do? The storage and\ntreatment conditional exemption exempts your low-level mixed waste from the\nregulatory definition of hazardous waste in section\n371.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle if your waste meets the eligibility criteria in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision and you meet the conditions in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nWhat wastes are\neligible for the storage and treatment conditional exemption? Low-level mixed\nwaste (LLMW), defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is eligible for this\nconditional exemption if it is generated and managed by you under a single\nlicense. (Mixed waste generated at a facility with a different license number\nand shipped to your facility for storage or treatment requires a permit and is\nineligible for this exemption. In addition, NARM waste is ineligible for this\nexemption.)\n(3)\n\nWhat conditions\nmust you meet for your LLMW to qualify for and maintain a storage and treatment\nexemption?\n(i) For your LLMW to qualify for\nthe exemption you must notify us in writing by certified delivery that you are\nclaiming a conditional exemption for the LLMW stored on your facility. The\ndated notification must include your name, address, RCRA identification number, license number, the waste code(s) and storage unit(s) for which you are seeking\nan exemption, and a statement that you meet the conditions of this section. Your notification must be signed by your authorized representative who\ncertifies that the information in the notification is true, accurate, and\ncomplete. You must notify us of your claim either within 90 days of the\neffective date of this rule, or within 90 days of when a storage unit is first\nused to store conditionally exempt LLMW. (ii)\n\nTo qualify for and maintain an exemption\nfor your LLMW you must: (a) store your LLMW\nwaste in tanks or containers in compliance with the requirements of your\nlicense that apply to the proper storage of low-level radioactive waste (not\nincluding those license requirements that relate solely to\nrecordkeeping); (b) store your LLMW\nin tanks or containers in compliance with chemical compatibility requirements\nof a tank or container in section\n373-2.9\n(h), or\n373-2.10\n(j), or\n373-3.9\n(g), or\n373-3.10\n(j) of\nthis Title; (c) certify that\nfacility personnel who manage stored conditionally exempt LLMW are trained in a\nmanner that ensures that the conditionally exempt waste is safely managed and\nincludes training in chemical waste management and hazardous materials\nincidents response that meets the personnel training standards found in section\n373-3.2\n(g)(1)(iii)\nof this Title; (d) conduct an\ninventory of your stored conditionally exempt LLMW at least annually and\ninspect it at least quarterly for compliance with this section; and\n(e) maintain an accurate emergency plan and\nprovide it to all local authorities who may have to respond to a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents. Your plan\nmust describe emergency response arrangements with local authorities; describe\nevacuation plans; list the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all\nfacility personnel qualified to work with local authorities as emergency\ncoordinators; and list emergency equipment. (c) Treatment. (1)\n\nWhat waste treatment does the storage and\ntreatment conditional exemption allow? You may treat your low-level mixed waste\nat your facility within a tank or container in accordance with the terms of\nyour license. Treatment that cannot be done in a tank or container without a\nRCRA permit (such as incineration) is not allowed under this\nexemption. (d) Loss\nof conditional exemption. (1)\n\nHow\ncould you lose the conditional exemption for your LLMW and what action must you\ntake?\n(i) Your LLMW will automatically lose\nthe storage and treatment conditional exemption if you fail to meet any of the\nconditions specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. When your LLMW loses\nthe exemption, you must immediately manage that waste which failed the\ncondition as RCRA hazardous waste, and the storage unit storing the LLMW\nimmediately becomes subject to RCRA hazardous waste container and/or tank\nstorage requirements. (a) If you fail to meet\nany of the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section you must\nreport to us and the agency who issued your license, in writing by certified\ndelivery within 30 days of learning of the failure. Your report must be signed\nby your authorized representative certifying that the information provided is\ntrue, accurate, and complete. This report must include: (1)\nthe specific condition(s) you failed to\nmeet; (2)\na description of the LLMW\n(including the waste name, hazardous waste codes and quantity) and storage\nlocation at the facility; and\n(3)\nthe date(s) on which you failed to meet the condition(s). (b) If the failure to meet any of the\nconditions may endanger human health or the environment, you must also\nimmediately notify us orally within 24 hours and follow up with a written\nnotification within five days. Failures that may endanger human health or the\nenvironment include, but are not limited to, discharge of a CERCLA reportable\nquantity or other leaking or exploding tanks or containers, or detection of\nradionuclides above background or hazardous constituents in the leachate\ncollection system of a storage area. If the failure may endanger human health\nor the environment, you must follow the provisions of your emergency\nplan. (ii)\n\nWe may\nterminate your conditional exemption for your LLMW, or require you to meet\nadditional conditions to claim a conditional exemption, for serious or repeated\nnoncompliance with any requirement(s) of this section. (2)\n\nIf you lose the storage and treatment\nconditional exemption for your LLMW, can the exemption be reclaimed?\n(i) You may reclaim the storage and treatment\nexemption for your LLMW if: (a) you again\nmeet the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and\n(b) you send us a notice by\ncertified delivery that you are reclaiming the exemption for your LLMW. Your\nnotice must be signed by your authorized representative certifying that the\ninformation contained in your notice is true, complete, and accurate. In your\nnotice you must do the following: (1)\nexplain\nthe circumstances of each failure; (2)\ncertify that you have corrected each\nfailure that caused you to lose the exemption for your LLMW and that you again\nmeet all the conditions as of the date you specify; (3)\ndescribe plans that you have implemented, listing specific steps you have taken, to ensure the conditions will be met in\nthe future; and\n(4)\ninclude any\nother information you want us to consider when we review your notice reclaiming\nthe exemption. (ii)\n\nWe may terminate a reclaimed conditional\nexemption if we find that your claim is inappropriate based on factors\nincluding, but not limited to, the following: you have failed to correct the\nproblem; you explained the circumstances of the failure unsatisfactorily; or\nyou failed to implement a plan with steps to prevent another failure to meet\nthe conditions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. In reviewing a reclaimed\nconditional exemption under this section, we may add conditions to the\nexemption to ensure that waste management during storage and treatment of the\nLLMW will protect human health and the environment. (e) Recordkeeping. (1)\n\nWhat records\nmust you keep at your facility and for how long?\n(i) In addition to those records required by\nyour license, you must keep records as follows: (a) your initial notification records, return\nreceipts, reports to us of failure(s) to meet the exemption conditions, and all\nrecords supporting any reclaim of an exemption; (b) records of your LLMW annual inventories, and quarterly inspections; (c) your\ncertification that facility personnel who manage stored mixed waste are trained\nin safe management of LLMW including training in chemical waste management and\nhazardous materials incidents response; and\n(d) your emergency plan as specified in\nsubparagraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. (ii)\n\nYou must maintain records concerning\nnotification, personnel trained, and your emergency plan for as long as you\nclaim this exemption and for three years thereafter, or in accordance with NRC\nregulations under 10 CFR part\n20\n(as incorporated by reference in section\n380-1.6\n[a]\nof this\n\nTitle), or applicable regulations in 10 NYCRR Part\n16, 12\nNYCRR Part 38, and\narticle 175 of the New York City Health Code (as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n380-1.6\n[a]\nof this\n\nTitle); whichever is longer. You must maintain records concerning your annual\ninventory and quarterly inspections for three years after the waste is sent for\ndisposal, or in accordance with NRC regulations under 10 CFR part\n20\n(as\nincorporated by reference in section\n380-1.6\n[a]\nof this\n\nTitle), or applicable regulations in 10 NYCRR Part\n16, 12\nNYCRR Part 38, and\narticle 175 of the New York City Health Code (as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n380-1.6\n[a]\nof this\n\nTitle), whichever is longer. (f) Reentry into RCRA. (1)\n\nWhen is your LLMW no longer eligible for\nthe storage and treatment conditional exemption?\n(i) When your LLMW has met the requirements\nof your license for decay-in-storage and can be disposed of as non-radioactive\nwaste, then the conditional exemption for storage no longer applies. On that\ndate your waste is subject to hazardous waste regulation under the relevant\nsections of this Part and Parts 370 through 373 and 376 of this Title, and the\ntime period for accumulation of a hazardous waste as specified in section\n372.2\n(a)(8)\nof\nthis Title begins. (ii)\n\nWhen your\nconditionally exempt LLMW, which has been generated and stored under a single\nlicense number, is removed from storage, it is no longer eligible for the\nstorage and treatment exemption. However, your waste may be eligible for the\ntransportation and disposal conditional exemption at paragraph (h)(1) of this\nsection. (g) Storage unit closure. (1)\n\nDo\nclosure requirements apply to units that stored LLMW prior to the effective\ndate of this section? Interim status and permitted storage units that have been\nused to store only LLMW prior to the effective date of this section and, after\nthat date, store only LLMW which becomes exempt under this section, are not\nsubject to the closure requirements of Subparts 373-2 and 373-3 of this Title. Storage units (for portions of units) that have been used to store both LLMW\nand non-mixed hazardous waste prior to the effective date of this section or\nare used to store both after that date remain subject to closure requirements\nwith respect to the non-mixed hazardous waste. (h) Transportation and disposal\nconditional exemption. (1)\n\nWhat does\nthe transportation and disposal conditional exemption do? This conditional\nexemption exempts your waste from the regulatory definition of hazardous waste\nin section 371.l(d) of this Title if your waste meets the eligibility criteria\nunder paragraph (i)(1) of this section, and you meet the conditions in\nparagraph (j)(1) of this section.
