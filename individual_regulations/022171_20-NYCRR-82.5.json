  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 82.5 - Unlawful acts of a CMSA retail dealer\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 483, 484(a)\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw, it shall be unlawful and a violation of article 20-A of the Tax Law for\nany CMSA retail dealer: (1)\nto induce or\nattempt to induce or to procure or attempt to procure the purchase of\ncigarettes at a price which is less than the cost of the agent with respect to\nsales to CMSA retail dealers, if purchased from an agent, or at a price which\nis less than the cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer with respect to sales to\nCMSA retail dealers (see sections\n82.2\nand\n82.3\nof this Part); (2)\nto induce or\nattempt to induce or to procure or attempt to procure any rebate or concession\nof any kind or nature whatsoever in connection with the purchase of cigarettes\n(see Part 84 of this Title for rebates and concessions); or\n(3)\nwith the intent to injure competitors or\nto destroy or substantially lessen competition, or with the intent to avoid the\ncollection or paying over of any taxes as may be required by law, to advertise, offer to sell or sell cigarettes in New York State at less than the cost of the\nCMSA retail dealer (see Part 83 of this Title relating to prima facie evidence\nof such intentions). (b) (1)\n\nCost of the CMSA retail dealer. The\ncost of the CMSA retail dealer\nmeans the basic cost of\ncigarettes (as defined in section\n80.2\nof\nthis Title) plus the cost of doing business by the agent with respect to sales\nof cigarettes to CMSA retail dealers plus the cost of doing business by the\nCMSA retail dealer. Where cigarettes are purchased from other than an agent, the sum of the cost of doing business by the agent with respect to sales to\nCMSA wholesale dealers plus the cost of doing business by the CMSA wholesale\ndealer with respect to sales to CMSA retail dealers may be substituted for the\ncost of doing business by the agent in the aforementioned equation. (2)\n(i) The\ncost of doing business by the CMSA retail dealer\nas used in\nthis subdivision shall mean the CMSA retail dealer's cost of doing business as\nevidenced by the accounting standards and methods regularly employed by the\nCMSA retail dealer in determining costs for purposes of Federal income tax\nreporting for the total operation of the dealer's establishment. The cost of\ndoing business must include, without limitation, labor (including salaries of\nexecutives and officers), rent, depreciation, selling costs, maintenance of\nequipment, delivery costs, interest payable, all types of licenses, taxes, insurance and advertising, and must be expressed as a percentage and applied to\nthe basic cost of cigarettes. A CMSA retail dealer who wishes to use the actual\ncost of doing business by the CMSA retail dealer pursuant to this subparagraph\nin determining the cost of the CMSA retail dealer, rather than using the\npresumptive cost of doing business by the CMSA retail dealer pursuant to\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, must first establish such actual cost of\ndoing business to the satisfaction of the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (ii)\n\"CMSA retail dealer's\npresumptive minimum markup\". In the absence of filing with the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance satisfactory proof of a lesser cost of doing business of\nthe CMSA retail dealer making the sale, the cost of doing business by the CMSA\nretail dealer shall be presumed to be seven percent of the sum of the basic\ncost of cigarettes plus the cost of doing business by the agent with respect to\nsales of cigarettes to CMSA retail dealers. (3)\n\nAny fractional part of a cent in the cost\nof the CMSA retail dealer per package or per carton of cigarettes must be\nrounded off to the next higher cent. (4)\n\nIn accord with section\n80.2\n(a)(3)\nof this Title, the Department of Taxation and Finance will periodically publish\na cost of the CMSA retail dealer for sales of cigarettes based on the presumed\ncost of doing business by the CMSA retail dealer. Such cost will be for\nstandard brands and may be used to comply with this section with respect to\nstandard brands. Such cost, however, will not reflect any sales tax. See\nsection\n526.5\n(b)(2)\nof this Title for sales tax computations with respect to cigarettes. (c) (1)\nA CMSA retail dealer may not purchase\ncigarettes in New York State at a price which is less than the cost of the\nagent with respect to sales to CMSA retail dealers, if purchased from an agent, or at a price which is less than the cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer with\nrespect to sales to CMSA retail dealers, if purchased from a CMSA wholesale\ndealer. A CMSA retail dealer who wishes to purchase cigarettes at a price which\nis less than the cost of the CMSA retail dealer, must furnish its supplier with\na valid copy of its New York State certificate of registration as a retail\ndealer. Just as the supplier must have knowledge of its purchaser, so too must\na CMSA retail dealer have knowledge of its supplier. A CMSA retail dealer must\nbe capable of demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Department of Taxation\nand Finance that it purchased cigarettes at a price which was not less than the\ncost of the agent or the cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer, as the case may be, with respect to sales to CMSA retail dealers. In doing so, the CMSA retail\ndealer may ultimately need to call upon its supplier to help establish such\ncosts. (2)\nA CMSA retail dealer, who has no reason to believe otherwise, may assume that it has not violated any\nprovision of article 20-A of the Tax Law, where such dealer purchases standard\nbrand cigarettes in this State at a price which is greater than or equal to the\ncost of the agent or cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer, with respect to sales\nto CMSA retail dealers, as periodically published by the department in\naccordance with sections\n82.2\n(b)(4)\nand\n82.3\n(b)(4)\nof this Part. (d) A CMSA\nretail dealer may not advertise, offer to sell or sell cigarettes in this State\nto any person at a price which is less than the cost of the CMSA retail dealer. A licensed cigarette agent, a licensed CMSA wholesale dealer, a registered\nchain store and any other person are considered to be CMSA retail dealers with\nrespect to their sales of cigarettes to consumers. (e) Illustration. (1)\n\nThe following illustrations exemplify the\nprovisions of this section with respect to purchases and sales of cigarettes by\nCMSA retail dealers. Such illustrations are a continuance of sections\n82.2\n(e)(2)(iv)\nand\n82.3\n(f)(3)(iii)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nPurchases by a\nCMSA retail dealer (illustrated). A CMSA retail dealer may not purchase\ncigarettes in New York State at a price which is less than the cost of the\nagent or the cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer, with respect to sales to CMSA\nretail dealers or, using the cited examples in sections\n82.2\nand\n82.3\nof this Part, $89.54 per carton. (3)\n\nSales by CMSA retail dealers\n(illustrated). In the absence of substantiating a lesser actual cost of doing\nbusiness, a CMSA retail dealer, including an agent, a CMSA wholesale dealer, a\nchain store or any other person with respect to their sales of cigarettes to\nconsumers, may not sell cigarettes in New York State at a price which is less\nthan the basic cost of cigarettes plus the cost of doing business by the agent\nwith respect to sales to CMSA retail dealers plus seven percent of the sum of\nthe basic cost plus the cost of doing business by the agent (the presumed cost\nof doing business by the CMSA retail dealer) or, using the cited examples in\nsections\n82.2\nand\n82.3\nof this Part, $95.80 per carton. Such amount is computed as follows: Basic cost of cigarettes\n$86.00\n\nAgent's presumed cost of doing business\n\nPercentage mark-up (3.875% of $86.00)\n+3.3325\n2 cents/package of 20 cigarettes multiplied by\n10 packages/carton\n+.20\n\nRetailer's presumed cost of doing business\n7% of: ($86.00 + [3.875% of $86.00] +.20)\n+ 6.2673\n\nCost of the CMSA retail dealer (rounded to next\nhigher cent)\n$95.80\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
