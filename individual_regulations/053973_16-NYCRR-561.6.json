  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 561.6 - Item lists\n\nState Regulations\n\nLists of \"items\" appearing in the texts of the accounts\nor elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the\napplication of the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be\nrepresentative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list\nwarrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text\nof the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently\nappears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be\ndetermined by the texts of the accounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n561.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
