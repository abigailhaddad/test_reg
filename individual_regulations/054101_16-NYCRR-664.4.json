Tit. 16 § 664.4 - Plant retired for nonrecurring factors not recognized in depreciation rates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A retirement\nwill be considered as nonrecurring (extraordinary) only if the following\ncriteria are met: (1)\n\nThe impending retirement\nwas not adequately considered in setting past depreciation rates. (2)\n\nThe charging of the retirement against\nthe reserve will unduly deplete that reserve. (3)\n\nThe retirement is unusual such that\nsimilar retirements are not likely to recur in the future. (b) Upon direction or approval from this\ncommission, the company shall credit account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation, and charge account 1438, Deferred Maintenance and Retirements, with the\nunprovided-for loss in service value. Such amounts shall be distributed from\naccount 1438 to account 6561, Depreciation Expense--Telecommunications Plant in\n\nService, or account 6562, Depreciation Expense--Property Held for Future\n\nTelecommunications Use, over such period as this commission may direct or\napprove.
