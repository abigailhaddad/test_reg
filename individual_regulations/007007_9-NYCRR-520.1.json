  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 520.1 - Who may impose non-judicial punishment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nCommander includes the person duly\nappointed by superior authority as commander of NYANG or of any New York Air\n\nNational Guard Wing, Group, Squadron of Flight. (2)\n\nResponsible Commander is the commander\nwho intends to impose or who has imposed non-judicial punishment or who has\ntaken remedial action, in a given action, as the case may be. (3)\n\nMembers of his command refers to the\nassigned members of the element or organization commanded, and others on\ntemporary duty with or otherwise attached to, the element, or organization. An\nattachment on TDY orders for the specific purpose of exercising non-judicial\npunishment authority is not necessary if the commander exercises the usual\nresponsibilities and attributes of command over the member. In such case the\ncommander has concurrent authority with the commander of the member's element\nor organization of assignment. In the case of Active Guard/Reserve (AGR)\nmembers, commander includes the lowest level supervisor of an AGR member at his\nwork station who is a commissioned or warrant officer. (4)\n\nAny commander who is a commissioned or\nwarrant officer may impose non-judicial punishment on members of his command\nfor minor offenses, subject to limitations on this authority by statute, regulation, or order by superior authority. (i) As used here, the term minor offenses\nrefers to any act or omission that is considered an offense under the punitive\narticles of the Military Law. Some of the factors to be considered in deciding\nwhether the offense is \"minor\" are: the nature of the offense, the\ncircumstances surrounding its commission, contemporary military and civilian\nstandards, and the age and prior service of the offender. (5)\n\nThis authority may be delegated only to\nthe officer who would assume command in the event of the death, disability or\nabsence of the commander. This delegation must be in writing and cited whenever\nexercised. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n520.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
