  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-7.4 - Additional design and construction requirements for aboveground and belowground disposal units\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Loads and\nload combinations. (1)\n\nThe disposal units\nmust be designed and constructed to withstand the loads and load combinations, including dead load, live load, soil and surcharge loading, and loads resulting\nfrom major natural phenomena, without undergoing deformation, settlement, or\ncracking that could adversely affect the ability of the land disposal facility\nto meet the performance objectives. (2)\n\nAll design loads and load combinations\nmust include appropriate load factors and safety factors in accordance with\nstandard engineering practices unless otherwise specified in these regulations. In the absence of, or deviation from, relevant codes and standard engineering\npractice, the applicant must provide in the application the rationale for\nselection of particular loads, safety factors, and/or related structural\nanalysis methods. (b) Structural analysis and design. (1)\n\nStructural analysis and design must be performed under the direction of a\nlicensed engineer and reviewed and certified by a licensed engineer. The\nlicensed engineer must have a minimum of 10 years experience in structural\nanalysis and design involving structures and materials similar to those\nproposed for the disposal units, but not necessarily disposal units for\nradioactive waste. (2)\n\nDocuments\ncontaining detailed design and construction plans and specifications must be\nsubmitted in the permit application. These documents must include descriptions\nof the foundations, structures, structural systems and major components; design\ndrawings; material properties and reasons for selecting particular materials; design calculations, including pertinent assumptions, criteria and data\nreferences; seismic analysis; descriptions and copies of all computer programs\nused in design, including method of validation; listings of all relevant codes\nand standards followed; construction sequence; and a description of all special\nprocedures to provide reasonable assurance that the performance objectives will\nbe met. (3)\n\nThe bearing capacity of\nthe foundation soils must be verified by testing. The foundation design must be\nbased on the determined bearing capacity and include a safety factor consistent\nwith standard engineering practice to prevent subsidence or shifting of the\nstructure that could adversely affect the ability of the land disposal facility\nto meet the performance objectives. (c) Design of concrete structures. (1)\n\nStandard. The analysis and design\nprocedures to be used for concrete structures must, at a minimum, be in\ncompliance with the 1989 edition of the American Concrete Institute Manual of\n\nConcrete Practice (see section\n383-1.8\nof this Part). For\nstructural steel members and components, the analysis and design must, at a\nminimum, be in compliance with the ninth edition (1990) of the American\n\nInstitute of Steel Construction Manual of Steel Construction (see section\n383-1.8\nof this Part). (2)\n\nUse of reinforcement. (i) The use of steel reinforcement must be\nminimized in concrete structures that form the essential components of the\ndisposal units. Steel reinforcement may be utilized to control shrinkage and\nthermal stresses to minimize cracking of concrete during the construction and\noperation periods, but must not be relied upon for long-term stability\nfollowing facility closure. (ii)\n\nThe load-bearing capacity for any structural component must be at least 1.5\ntimes the maximum design load assuming the concrete cover to the reinforcement\nand the reinforcement itself are not effective. (iii)\n\nIn minimizing the reinforcing steel\nrequired, the concrete members of the components essential to the stability of\nthe disposal units must be designed to place as much of the structure as\npossible in compression throughout the design life of the disposal units while\nmeeting the other design requirements and providing reasonable assurance that\nthe performance objectives will be met. The design must be accomplished without\nthe use of pre-stressing mechanisms such as rods or wires. (iv)\n\nThe use of alternative, corrosion-resistant reinforcing materials that can meet the design requirements\nmay be proposed in the permit application. (d) Quality and durability of construction\nmaterials. (1)\n\nGeneral material requirements. (i) Construction materials used in all\nstructures and components of the disposal units must be of adequate\ncomposition, quality and quantity to provide reasonable assurance that the\nstructures and components will function as designed and that the performance\nobjectives will be met. The materials must be tested and shown to meet the\nstandards of quality and durability as specified in the plans and\nspecifications approved in the permit, to be compatible with all other\ncomponents of the disposal unit, and to provide reasonable assurance of\nlong-term performance. All materials must be monitored for radioactive\ncontamination prior to use. An operating portal monitoring system approved by\nthe department will be sufficient to satisfy this requirement. (ii)\n\nWhere no codes or standards exist, or\nthe recognized codes and standards do not adequately address the properties\nrequired, the applicant must submit documentation in the application describing\nthe rationale of choice, test methods and data, and/or the in-service history\nthat substantiates the selection and the use of the material for the intended\napplication. (iii)\n\nAll synthetic\nand manufactured materials must be installed in accordance with the engineering\nplans and specifications approved in the permit and, unless otherwise\nauthorized by the department, in accordance with the manufacturer's\nrecommendations. (2)\n\nConcrete materials. (i) Concrete material\ntypes and proportioning, concrete placement, and curing must be specified to\nachieve the required design strength, minimize shrinkage and heat of hydration, and maximize density, impermeability, durability, and resistance to chemical\nattack. Admixtures and constituent materials the sole purpose of which is\nconstruction convenience and which may have a possible long-term detrimental\neffect on the concrete must not be used. (ii)\n\nThe materials used in the concrete, including admixtures and the concrete constituents, must be tested and approved\nas compatible, nonreactive, and acceptable for the application. The testing\nmethods must be identified in the application. (iii)\n\nConcrete constituents must be selected\nto avoid possible reactivity between the cement alkalis and the aggregate and\nany potential reactivity of the materials with the disposed waste. (3)\n\nStructural steel, concrete\nreinforcing, and miscellaneous metals. (i) Structural steel and miscellaneous metals utilized in the construction of the\ndisposal units must be protected against corrosion. The use of\ncorrosion-resistant metals must be evaluated and may be used if approved by the\ndepartment. (ii)\n\nReinforcing steel\nand other metals embedded in concrete must be protected against corrosion. The\ndesign of concrete disposal units must compensate for protective methods that\naffect concrete bonding. (4)\n\nThe quality assurance and control program\nfor the construction of concrete disposal unit structures must include field\nradiography, transmission, or back-scatter beam technology or other\nnondestructive techniques and related testing as specified in the QA/QC program\nrequired by section\n383-7.2\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart to detect any voids or cracks that could lead to subsequent shielding\nor stability problems. (e) Water infiltration resistance. (1)\n\nConcrete structures and concrete\ncomponents must be designed and constructed to minimize the occurrence of\ncracking. (2)\n\nThe use of\nconstruction joints must be limited to the maximum extent practicable. Construction and expansion joints that are installed must contain waterstops\nand joint sealants. The waterstops and joint sealants selected must have proven\ndurability and compatibility with the concrete and other materials with which\nthey will be in contact. (3)\n\nConstruction and expansion joints in the concrete must be designed to resist\nleakage. (f) External\ndrainage. An exterior passive filter and drainage system must be located under\nand around the base of each disposal unit to divert any water that has\ninfiltrated the soil or rock around the disposal unit to a foundation drain and\na sump so that any infiltrated water can be monitored, collected, and treated\nas necessary throughout the operation, closure, and post-closure\nperiods. (g) Internal drainage. (1)\n\nThe disposal units must be designed and\nconstructed with an internal drainage system to minimize the contact of\ninfiltrating water with the waste. The drainage system must be designed and\nconstructed to ensure the passive release of infiltrating water to the\npermeable bottom layer of buffer material required by subdivision (h) of this\nsection throughout the operation, closure, and post-closure periods. (2)\n\nThe drainage system must include\ncollection sump(s) (separate from the exterior drainage system and sump) so\nthat any water that infiltrates the disposal unit can be collected and\nmonitored as required by section\n383-10.5\nof this Part. (h) Retention of radionuclides. The disposal unit must be designed and constructed with a permeable bottom\nlayer (or layers) of buffer material that has the capacity to retard the\nrelease of radionuclides from the disposal unit caused by water that may\ninfiltrate the disposal unit and the waste. The properties of the buffer\nmaterial, the rationale for selecting a particular buffer material, and the\nrequired buffer layer thickness must be documented as part of the\napplication. (i) Security and\nintrusion resistance. (1)\n\nThe design of the\ndisposal units must incorporate provisions to meet the requirements of section\n382.33\n(a) or\n382.34\nof this Title. (2)\n\nThe design of the disposal units must\ninclude provisions to prevent unauthorized entrance during\noperations. (j) Sealing\nrequirements. The inner surfaces of the disposal unit must be sealed to protect\nagainst water infiltration and damage by other elements. The coating or sealer\nmaterial selected must have been demonstrated to have durability, impermeability, bonding strength (with respect to concrete and similar\nstructural materials), and tensile strength.
