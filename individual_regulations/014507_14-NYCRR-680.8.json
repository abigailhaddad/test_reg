  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 680.8 - Staffing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A description\nof and rationale for the specialty hospital's staffing pattern including both\nmandatory and selective services shall be submitted as part of the initial\napplication for certification. This description shall specify for each service\nthe programs to be offered and the number of individuals to be served by each\nstaff member. Any changes in the staffing pattern, job descriptions and/or\nminimum qualifications of the staff must receive the prior approval of the\nOPWDD. (b) There shall be qualified\nstaff on duty during all hours of each day in sufficient numbers to carry out\nthe policies, responsibilities and programs of the specialty hospital, and to\nmaintain the premises in a safe and sanitary condition. A staff of sufficient\nsize shall be employed so that the specialty hospital does not depend on\nindividuals or volunteers for services. However, interns and students assigned\nfor formal work experience, and volunteers who are registered and have formal\nduty assignments are encouraged to participate in the program, but are not to\nbe used as substitutes for the staff. (1)\n\nThe\nadministrator of the specialty hospital shall have the following\nqualifications: (i) a degree of doctor of\nmedicine or a master's degree or its equivalent in hospital administration, public health, science, administrative medicine or business administration when\ngranted for a program in hospital administration, from a college or university\naccredited by the New York State Education Department or whose program is\napproved by the Association of University Programs in Hospital Administration. Such person shall have a minimum of two years as the administrator, associate\nor assistant administrator of an accredited hospital or in health service\nadministration acceptable to the commissioner; or\n(ii)\na degree as a registered nurse with a\nminimum of three years experience as an administrator, associate or assistant\nadministrator of an accredited hospital, or in health services administration\nacceptable to the commissioner; or\n(iii)\na bachelor's degree from a college or\nuniversity accredited by the New York State Education Department and has served\na minimum of five years as an administrator, associate or assistant\nadministrator in an accredited hospital, or in health services administration\nacceptable to the commissioner. (2)\n\nThe administrator of the specialty\nhospital shall ensure that there is a qualified physician to serve as medical\ndirector of the specialty hospital. This physician shall be a staff member and\nshall direct and supervise the health and medical care of the individuals and\nmaintain the general health conditions and practices of the specialty\nhospital. (3)\n\nThe administrator of\nthe specialty hospital shall appoint an individual as program director to have\noverall responsibility for the developmental programming services at the\nfacility. Such person shall, at a minimum, meet the qualifications of\nprofessional staff in their respective discipline. (4)\n\nThe administrator shall continuously\nemploy an adequate number of appropriately qualified staff to carry out the\nprogram of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, habilitation and rehabilitation\neffectively. A written rationale for the staffing pattern utilized shall be\nprepared. If the specialty hospital is a unit of a general hospital or a\nprogram within an agency funded by OPWDD, then this rationale must clearly\nspecify any regular use of personnel whose primary duty assignments are\nelsewhere in the general hospital or within the agency funded by OPWDD. (However, the specialty hospital shall be solely responsible for all services\nprovided to individuals in its care and no other department, unit, agency or\nhospital shall separately make claims for payment for these services. The\nspecialty hospital shall be responsible for ensuring that no duplicate billing\noccurs.)\n(i) The medical director and all\nstaff physicians shall be currently registered and licensed to practice\nmedicine in the State of New York; their qualifications shall be reported to\nOPWDD at the time of their employment. (ii)\n\nThe specialty hospital shall not permit\nthe physicians in training to perform a service for which a license is required\nby the State of New York except as a part of an approved training program\nand/or unless authorized on a temporary certificate to practice medicine at the\nspecialty hospital. Such physicians in training or on a temporary permit are to\nbe under the direct control and supervision of a currently registered and\nlicensed physician. (a) A training program, to\nbe approved, must be accredited by the Council on Medical Education of the\n\nAmerican Medical Association, the appropriate specialty boards or any other\nrecognized approval body based on standards acceptable to OPWDD. (b) With respect to the care of recipients of\n\nFederal health insurance and medical assistance only, training programs must\ncomply with the requirements of applicable rules and regulations of the\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services pertaining to resident, intern and\nmedical student training programs enacted to the Health Insurance for the Aged\n\nAct. (iii)\n\nAll direct\nservice, other than in an emergency, provided by interns, house officers, residents or physicians with equivalent titles must be provided as specified in\nparagraph (ii) of this subdivision or must be provided by a physician currently\nregistered and licensed to practice in New York State.

(v) All staff members\nproviding services as members of professions, the practice of which is by law\nrequired to be licensed, certified or registered shall file documentation of\ncompliance with the governing body; this documentation shall be retained on\nfile and made available to OPWDD upon request. (vi)\n\nAll staff members providing services as\nmembers of professions, the practice of which does not by law require\nlicensure, certification or registration shall file documentation of their\ntraining and experience with the governing body. This documentation shall be\nretained on file and made available to OPWDD upon request. (vii)\n\nAll other program staff shall have\nqualifications appropriate to their assigned responsibilities as set forth in\nwritten policies of the governing body and shall be subject to appropriate\nprofessional staff supervision.

(c) The specialty hospital shall employ and\nassign to each individual living unit a sufficient number of appropriately\nqualified and trained personnel to provide health care services and self-care\nservices. Staffing for each living unit shall be based on the severity of\ndisabilities of all individuals.

The required number of qualified\nfull-time equivalent physicians on duty or on call shall be as follows: (i) if the number of individuals is less than\n125, one physician on duty at all times, or one nurse practitioner on duty at\nall times and one physician on call and available to the nurse practitioner at\nall times though not necessarily on site, shall be required; (ii)\nif the number of individuals is less\nthan 200, but greater than 125, then one physician shall be on duty at all\ntimes and one physician shall be on call though not necessarily on\nsite; (iii)\nif the number of\nindividuals exceeds 200, but is less than 225, two physicians shall be on duty\nat all times; and\n(iv)\nif the\nnumber of individuals is greater than 225, the number of physicians on duty at\nall times shall be determined by the commissioner. (2)\n\nThere shall be on duty to provide nursing\nservices during the first and second shift s one registered nurse for every 20\nindividuals; during the third shift, through the hours when individuals are\nsleeping, there shall be on duty one registered professional nurse for every 30\nindividuals.
