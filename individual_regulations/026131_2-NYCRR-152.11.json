The amount\nof the monthly straight life annuity payment shall be one-twelfth of the\nbenefit amount times the years of ambulance service credit earned by the\nparticipant as of the effective date of the commencement of payment of his or\nher service award. (b) Except as\notherwise provided in this section, a participant shall be entitled to apply\nfor and receive distribution of a service award only when the participant has\nacquired a, nonforfeitable right to a service award and has attained the\nentitlement age. A written application for distribution must be received by the\nadministrator from a participant before payments shall commence to the\nparticipant. The participant shall, on such written application, specify the\neffective date of payment commencement and shall select the form of payment of\nhis or her service award. The effective date of payment commencement shall be\nthe first day of any month commencing within the 90-day period immediately\nfollowing the date the written application is received by the administrator. A\nparticipant may file a written application within the 90-day period immediately\npreceding the date on which he or she shall have attained the entitlement age\nand acquired a nonforfeitable right to a service award and specify an effective\ndate of payment commencement: (1)\nno earlier\nthan the date of attainment of the entitlement age and acquiring a\nnonforfeitable right to a service award; and\n(2)\nno later than 90 days after the\napplication is filed with the administrator. (c) The effective date of the commencement of\npayment of a service award to a participant shall not be on or before the last\nday of the first calendar year during which a participant earned a year of\nambulance service credit. (d) The\nadministrator shall approve an application for distribution based on the terms\nof the sponsor's adoption agreement, the records maintained by the\nadministrator and, in the case of disability or death, such additional records\nor information as the administrator may require. The administrator, in its sole\ndiscretion, may require the sponsor, the appropriate ambulance company or the\nparticipant to verify or supply any information the administrator deems\nnecessary to determine entitlement to distribution of a service\naward. (e) The number and types of\noptional forms of payments of a service award available under a program shall\nbe at the sole discretion of the administrator subject to the approval of the\n\nComptroller. Program sponsors and ambulance companies whose volunteer ambulance\nworkers participate in a defined benefit plan service award program shall be\npromptly notified by the administrator in writing of any changes in the\noptional forms of payment. Participants shall then be promptly notified about\nsuch changes by the ambulance company. The optional forms of payment under the\nprogram are set forth in section\n152.26\nof this Part. (f) For determining the payments of a service\naward to a participant under an actuarially equivalent form of payment, the\nprogram actuary shall use the actuarial assumptions used to calculate the\nannual program costs payable by the sponsor during the calendar year in which\nthe payments of the service award to the participant or the participant's\nbeneficiary shall commence. (g) No\nambulance service credit may be earned by a participant after the effective\ndate of commencement of payment of a service award to a participant. Only\nservice credit earned before the effective date of commencement of the service\naward payments to a participant shall be considered when calculating a\nparticipant's service award. (h) In\nthe event that a participant becomes totally and permanently disabled as\ncertified by the workers' compensation board or by any other competent\nauthority approved by the administrator, and the disability prevents the\nparticipant from pursuing his or her normal occupation, the participant shall\nbe entitled to apply for and receive distribution of his or her service award\nregardless of whether the participant has reached the entitlement age or\nacquired a nonforfeitable right to a service award. The participant may select\none of the optional forms of payment available under the service award program\nin case of disability. The value of the service award shall be determined on\nthe basis of the years of ambulance service credited to the participant as of\nthe effective date of commencement of payment of the service award. The amount\nof payments shall be calculated so as to be actuarially equivalent to the\npresent value of the payments as if they commenced at the entitlement\nage. (i) In the event of the death\nof a participant who has acquired a nonforfeitable right to a service award and\nwho has not previously received distribution of any portion of his or her\nservice award, the beneficiaries designated by the participant or, if no\nbeneficiaries have been so designated, the participant's estate, shall be\nentitled to apply for and receive distribution of the participant's service\naward. The applicant may select one of the optional forms of payment available\nunder the service award program in case of death. The value of the service\naward shall be determined on the basis of the years of ambulance service\ncredited to the participant as of the effective date of commencement of payment\nof the service award. The amount of the payments shall be calculated so as to\nbe actuarially equivalent to the present value of the payments as if they\ncommenced at the entitlement age. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
