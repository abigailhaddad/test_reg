  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 430.1 - Returns of distributors of kero-jet fuel only\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 282, 282-a and 287\n(a) Any person, firm, association or\ncorporation who or which engages in the retail sale of kero-jet fuel for jet\nairplanes from a fixed and permanent place at an airport within New York State\nis a\nfixed base operator. The Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance may register as a distributor of kero-jet fuel, a fixed base operator\nwho makes no sales of kero-jet fuel other than retail sales delivered directly\ninto the fuel tank of an airplane for use in the operation thereof and who\nmakes no other sales of diesel motor fuel; such class of distributor is\nreferred to as a distributor of kero-jet fuel only. Such registration is\napplicable only to the wholesale purchase of kero-jet fuel and to the retail\nsale of such fuel so delivered. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article and for purposes of this\n\nPart: (1)\n\nDiesel motor fuel\nmeans kerosene, crude oil, fuel oil or other middle distillate and also motor\nfuel suitable for use in the operation of an engine of the diesel type, excluding, however, any product specifically designated No. 4 diesel fuel and\nnot suitable as a fuel used in the operation of a motor vehicle engine. For the\npurpose of the exclusion, No. 4 diesel fuel, properly labeled, which conforms\nto the following specifications will not be considered suitable for use as a\nfuel in the operation of a motor vehicle engine and thus will be excluded from\nthe definition of diesel motor fuel: (i) the\nflash point of such product is between 130°F and 150°F when tested in\naccordance with American Society for Testing and Materials test method\nD93; (ii)\nthe viscosity of such\nproduct at 100°F is between 45 and 125 Saybolt universal seconds when tested in\naccordance with American Society for Testing and Materials test method\nD-445/D-2161; (iii)\nthe ignition\nquality cetane of such product is not rated in accordance with generally\nacceptable industry standards for determining ignition quality cetane; and\n(iv)\nsuch product, if blended, contains no more than 50 percent No. 2 fuel oil. (2)\n\nKero-jet fuel\nmeans a\nquality, highly refined kerosene product or derivative thereof, which meets\nkerosene-type jet fuel specifications and which is primarily used for\ncommercial turbojet and turboprop aircraft engines. (c) (1)\n\nIn\nlieu of filing monthly returns pursuant to section\n287\nof the Tax Law, every distributor of\nkero-jet fuel only may file with the Department of Taxation and Finance\nquarterly tax returns on forms prescribed by the department for such purpose, even though no tax may be payable. Such quarterly returns must be filed on or\nbefore the 20th day of March, June, September and December for the three-month\nperiods ending with the last day of February, May, August and November, respectively. The returns must be prepared in accordance with the instructions\nprovided by the department and must be accompanied by all supporting\nschedules. (2)\n\nEvery return filed\nby or on behalf of a distributor of kero-jet fuel only must contain a\ncertification to the effect that the statements in the return are true, correct\nand complete. The fact that the distributor's name and/or an individual's name\nis signed on the certification of the return is prima facie evidence for all\npurposes that such individual is authorized to sign and certify the return on\nbehalf of the distributor and that the return was actually signed by the\ndistributor. (3)\n\nReturns of\ndistributors of kero-jet fuel only must be filed with the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, Transaction and Transfer Tax Bureau, in care of P.O. Box\n1833, Albany, New York 12201-1833. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n430.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
