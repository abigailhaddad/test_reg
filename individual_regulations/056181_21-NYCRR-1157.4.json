Tit. 21 § 1157.4 - Responsibilities of applicants\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nApplicants to the authority for a permit\nwhich will grant permission to the applicant to commence or engage in a project\nor activity may be requested by the authority, and if so requested, shall\nsubmit to the authority an environmental assessment in the form prescribed by\nthe State Department of Environmental Conservation which describes and analyzes\nthe environmental impact and effect of the proposed project or activity of the\napplicant in sufficient detail for the authority to determine: (i) Whether the proposed project or activity\nof the applicant constitutes an exempt act. (ii)\n\nWhether the issuance of such permit by\nthe authority is a ministerial act. (iii)\n\nWhether the proposed project or\nactivity of the applicant constitutes a Type II action. (iv)\n\nWhether the proposed project or activity\nof the applicant may or will not have a significant effect on the\nenvironment. (v) Which other\nagencies, including Federal agencies, have jurisdiction by law, rule or\nregulation over the proposed project or activity of the applicant and whether\nor not the authority is the lead agency with respect to the proposed action or\nactivity. (2)\n\nIn each\nenvironmental assessment, the applicant shall, in his description and analysis\nof the environmental impact and effect of the proposed project or activity, make a recommendation with respect to each item set forth in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision. (3)\n\nIf in the\njudgment of the authority, the information provided in such assessment is not\nsufficient for the authority to make such determinations, the applicant will be\nrequired to furnish such additional information on the proposed project or\nactivity deemed necessary for such determinations. An application shall be\ndeemed incomplete until such information is furnished. (b) (1)\n\nIf\nthe authority determines that the proposed project for which a permit is sought\nmay have a significant effect on the environment and the proposed project or\nactivity of the applicant is not an exempt act or a Type II action, and the\nissuance of a permit of the authority is not a ministerial act, the authority\nmay request the applicant to prepare either a DEIS or an environmental impact\nreport on the proposed project or activity in accordance with the requirements\nof SEQR. (2)\n\nShould an applicant be\nrequested to prepare a DEIS and should such applicant decline to prepare such a\nDEIS, and there is no other agency which would more appropriately be the lead\nagency with respect to the proposed project or activity, the authority may\nprepare the DEIS or cause its preparation to be undertaken. However, the\nauthority shall not commence preparation of such DEIS nor cause its preparation\nto be undertaken until a complete environmental impact report has been\nsubmitted by the applicant which analyzes in detail all factors required to be\nconsidered in an impact statement by SEQR. (c) The authority may require an applicant to\nprepare a supplemental environmental impact report which responds in detail to\nany and all comments received on the DEIS and at any hearing held for the\napplicants' proposed project or activity. (d) An application, environmental assessment, DEIS, environmental impact report or supplemental environmental impact report\nshall be deemed completed only when approved as to form and content by the\nauthority. (e) The submission by an\napplicant for a permit from the authority shall be deemed the contractual\nobligation of the applicant to pay all fees and costs allocable to such\napplication as are allowable by this Part. No contract, or other form of\nassistance or permit, lease, license, certificate or other entitlement for use\nor permission to act shall be made, granted or issued by the authority until\nall fees due under this Part from the applicant shall have been\npaid.
