  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8003.4 - Restitution and mandatory surcharge\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where an inmate under the jurisdiction of\nthe Department of Correctional Services is subject to an undischarged\nrestitution order or an order of mandatory surcharge imposed by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction, the board may, prior to the inmate's parole or\nconditional release, impose as a special written condition of release a\nrequirement that the releasee comply with such order. A special condition\ninvolving the payment of restitution or mandatory surcharge shall, unlike other\nspecial conditions, only be imposed upon a releasee by a member of the Board of\n\nParole. (b) At the time this\ncondition is imposed by the board, the releasee shall be given written notice\nof the agency that shall have responsibility for restitution collection. The\nchief-elected official in each county, and the mayor in the City of New York, shall designate the restitution collection agency; except that in those\ncounties where the State Division of Probation and Correctional Alternatives\nprovides for and delivers probation services, said agency shall have the first\noption of designating the restitution collection agency for such\ncounties. (c) When a releasee, supervised pursuant to a special condition regarding restitution, or mandatory\nsurcharge is granted permission by the Division of Parole to change his place\nof residence from one county to another, or between New York City and another\ncounty, the parole officer shall notify the restitution collection agency of\nthat fact. If the division is notified by the designated restitution collection\nagency that the responsibility for such restitution collection is thereafter to\nbe transferred to a different restitution agency, pursuant to a releasee's\nchange of county of residence or for any other reason, the division shall then\nprovide the releasee with written notification of said change. (d) When a releasee is discharged from the\njurisdiction of the division upon expiration of sentence or by board action\npursuant to Executive Law, section 259-j, or when a releasee is ordered\nreturned to an institution under the jurisdiction of the Department of\n\nCorrectional Services upon the revocation of parole or conditional release, the\ndivision shall so notify the restitution collection agency. Should the returned\nparole violator thereafter be reparoled or conditionally released, the\nprocedures to be followed relative to restitution and mandatory surcharge shall\nbe as previously stated in this subdivision.
