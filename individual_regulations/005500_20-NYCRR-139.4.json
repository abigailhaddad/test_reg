  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 139.4 - Allocation of distributable net income from New York State sources and modifications (net change)\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 639(a)(3)(A)\n(a) General rule. The distributable net income of a nonresident estate or\ntrust from New York State sources must be allocated among the estate or trust\nand its beneficiaries (including, solely for the purpose of this allocation, resident beneficiaries) in proportion to their respective shares of Federal\ndistributable net income. The share of the estate or trust in Federal\ndistributable net income is the amount, if any, by which the Federal\ndistributable net income exceeds the aggregate of the shares therein of all its\nbeneficiaries. The net change computed pursuant to section\n139.3\nof\nthis Part must be allocated among the estate or trust and its beneficiaries in\nthe same manner. (b) Special rule where an estate or trust has no Federal distributable net\nincome. [Tax Law, § 639(b)(1)] If an estate or trust has no\n\nFederal distributable net income for the taxable year, the share of each\nbeneficiary (including, solely for the purpose of this allocation, resident\nbeneficiaries) in the items derived from or connected with New York State\nsources which enter into the definition of\n\nFederal distributable net\nincome\ndetermined under section\n139.2\nof this Part, and in the net change determined under section\n139.3\nof\nthis Part, must be in proportion to his share of the estate or trust income for\nsuch year, under local law or the governing instrument, which is required to be\ndistributed currently, and any other amounts which are properly paid or\ncredited or required to be distributed during the taxable year. Any balance of\nsuch net change must be allocated to the estate or trust. (c) Alternate method of attributing\nmodifications among an estate or trust and its beneficiaries. [Tax Law, § 639(b)(2)] A fiduciary may, under the rules\nprovided for under section\n119.3\nof this Title, use the same alternate method provided for in that section to\nattribute the modifications relating to the share of a nonresident estate, trust or beneficiary in income derived from or connected with New York State\nsources among the estate or trust and its beneficiaries. However, those\napplicable New York modifications, or portions thereof, which are allocated to\nthe nonresident estate or trust under section\n138.4\nof this Article must be attributed to such estate or trust in determining its\n\nNew York taxable income regardless of whether the alternate method provided by\nsection\n119.3\nof this Title is used by the fiduciary.
