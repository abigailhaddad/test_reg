  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 800.7 - Emergency escape and self rescue ropes and system components for firefighters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Title and\ncitation. Within and for the purposes of the Department of Labor, this section\nmay be known as Code Rule 800.7, Emergency Escape and Self Rescue Ropes and\n\nSystem Components for Firefighters, specifying the requirements for safety\nropes and associated system components. (b) Purpose and intent. This rule is intended\nto ensure that firefighters are provided with necessary escape rope and system\ncomponents for self rescue and emergency escape and to establish specifications\nfor such ropes and system components. (c) Application. This section shall apply\nthroughout the State of New York to the State, any political subdivision of the\n\nState, Public Authorities, Public Benefit Corporations or any other\ngovernmental agency or instrumentality thereof employing firefighters within\nthe meaning of section\n27-a\nof the Labor\n\nLaw. This section shall not apply to such employers located in a\ncity with a population of over one million. (d) Definitions. Within this section, the\nfollowing terms shall have the meanings indicated: (1)\n\nSystem components means safety harnesses, belts, ascending devices, carabiners, descent control devices, rope grab\ndevices, and snap links. (2)\n\nEscape\nrope means a single purpose, single use, emergency escape (self-rescue)\nrope. (3)\n\nInterior structural fire\nfighting means the physical activity of fire suppression, rescue or both, inside of buildings or enclosed structures which are involved in a fire\nsituation beyond the incipient stage. (4)\n\nInterior structural fire fighter means a\nfirefighter who is designated by their employer to perform interior structural\nfirefighting duties in an immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH)\natmosphere and is medically qualified to use self-contained breathing apparatus\n(SCBA) as defined in\n29 CFR\n1910.134. (5)\n\nEntrapment at elevations means a\nsituation where a firefighter finds the normal route of exit is made unusable\nby fire, or other emergency situation, that requires the firefighter to\nimmediately exit the structure from an opening not designed as an exit, that is\nabove the ground floor and at an elevation above the surrounding terrain which\nwould reasonably be expected to cause injury should the firefighter be required\nto exit. (e) Specifications for escape ropes and system components. Escape ropes and system\ncomponents provided to firefighters shall conform to the requirements of \"The\n\nNational Fire Protection Association Standard 1983, Standard on Fire Service\n\nLife Safety Rope and Equipment for Emergency Services\" in effect at the time of\ntheir manufacture. Escape ropes and system components purchased after the\neffective date of this section shall conform to the 2006 edition (NFPA1983-\n2006) of such standard. (f) Risk\nassessment and equipment selection. (1)\n\nEach\nemployer who employs firefighters shall develop a written risk assessment to be\nused to determine under what circumstances escape ropes and system components\nwill be required and what type will be required to protect the safety of\nfirefighters in its employ. In performing the assessment, the employer shall: (i) identify the types and heights of\nbuildings and other structures in the area the firefighters are expected to\nwork. Such area shall include the regular scope of the fire district or other\narea covered by the fire department in question as well as any other districts\nor communities to which the fire department provides mutual aid with a\nreasonably predictable frequency; (ii)\nassess the standard operating procedures\nfollowed by the department with regard to rescue of firefighters from\nelevations; (iii)\nidentify the\nrisks to firefighters of being trapped at an elevation during structural fire\nfighting operations given the types of buildings or other structures located in\nthe area(s) in which firefighters are expected to work. Identification of the\nrisk in question shall include an assessment of: (a) the extent to which standard operating\nprocedures already in place will mitigate the risks identified; (b) the type of escape ropes and system\ncomponents that will be necessary to protect the safety of firefighters if\noperating procedures do not sufficiently mitigate the risk. (2)\n\nShould the risk\nassessment establish that firefighters employed by the department performing\ninterior structural firefighting are reasonably expected to be exposed to the\nrisk of entrapment at elevations, the employer shall provide to each interior\nstructural firefighter in its employ a properly fitted escape rope and those\nsystem components which meet the specifications for such rope and system\ncomponents set forth in subdivision (e) of this section and which would\nmitigate the danger to life and health associated with such risk. (g) Training. (1)\n\nThe employer shall ensure that each\nfirefighter who is provided with an escape rope and system components is\ninstructed in their proper use by a competent instructor. Instruction shall\ninclude the requirements of subdivision (h) of this section and the user\ninformation provided by the manufacturer as required by NFPA 1983 chapter 5.2\nfor each rope and system component. (2)\n\nInstruction shall include hands-on use of\nthe equipment in a controlled environment. (3)\nA record of such instruction including\nthe name of the individual being trained, the name of the individual delivering\nthe training, and the date on which the training was provided shall be\nmaintained by the employer until such time as the firefighter is no longer\nemployed by the employer or the employer delivers a subsequent training on this\ntopic, whichever comes first. (h) Employer duties. In addition to the\nduties set forth in subdivisions (f) and (g) of this section, employers covered\nby this section shall have the following duties: (1)\nto ensure the adequacy of the safety\nropes and system components, the employer shall routinely inspect and ensure\nthat: (i) existing safety ropes and system\ncomponents meet the codes, standards, and recommended practices adopted by the\ncommissioner; (ii)\nexisting safety\nropes and system components still perform their function by taking precautions\nto identify any of their limitations through reasonable means, including, but\nnot limited to: (a) checking the labels or\nstamps on the equipment; (b) checking any documentation or equipment specifications; and\n(c) contacting the supplier or approval\nagency; (iii)\nfirefighters are informed of the limitations of any safety rope or system\ncomponents; (iv)\nfirefighters are\nnot allowed or required to use any safety rope or system components beyond\ntheir limitations; (v) existing or\nnew safety ropes and system components have no visible defects that limit their\nsafe use; (vi)\nsafety ropes and\nsystem components are used, cleaned and maintained according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions; (vii)\nfirefighters are instructed in identifying to the employer any defects the\nfirefighter may find in safety ropes and system components; and\n(viii)\nany identified defects are corrected\nor immediate action is taken to eliminate the use of the equipment by: (a) ensuring that escape rope and system\ncomponents with defects which are repairable are tagged as unsafe and stored in\nsuch a manner that they cannot be used until repairs are made; (b) ensuring that escape ropes and system\ncomponents that cannot be repaired are immediately destroyed or rendered\nunusable as an escape rope and system components; and\n(c) ensuring that any escape rope that has\nbeen utilized under load for the purpose of self rescue/emergency escape is\nimmediately removed from service, destroyed, or rendered unusable as an escape\nrope and immediately replaced; (2)\nthe employer's routine inspection cycle\nrequired by this subdivision shall be based upon the volume of activity the\ndepartment undertakes but, in no case, any less frequently than once each\nmonth.
