  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 203-7.1 - Leak Detection Monitoring Techniques\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All owners and operators opting to comply using EPA Method 21, Volatile Organic\n\nCompound Leaks at 40 CFR Part\n60, appendix A-7 (see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), must meet the\nfollowing requirements: (1)\n\nFor the purposes\nof complying with the fugitive emissions monitoring program using EPA Method\n21, a fugitive emission is defined as an instrument reading of 500 ppm CH4 and\nVOC. (2)\n\nFor purposes of instrument\ncapability, the fugitive emissions definition shall be 500 ppm or greater CH4\nand VOC using a Flame Ionization Detector (FID)-based instrument. (3)\n\nIf an analyzer other than a FID-based\ninstrument is used, a site-specific fugitive emission definition must be\ndeveloped by the owner or operator that would be equivalent to 500 ppm CH4 and\nVOC using a FID-based instrument. Such site-specific fugitive emission\ndefinition is subject to approval by the Department. (b) Optical gas imaging. All owners and\noperators opting to comply using OGI must meet the following requirements: (1)\nOGI equipment must be capable of imaging\ngases in the spectral range for CH4 and VOC in the potential fugitive\nemissions. (2)\n\nCalibration and\nmaintenance procedures must comply with those recommended by the\nmanufacturer. (c) Alternative techniques. The Department may approve the use of an alternative\ntechnique that may be used in lieu of, or in combination with, OGI, Method 21, or other previously approved alternative methods. A proposed alternative method\nmust be able to demonstrate that it is capable of identifying leaks and that it\nis at least as effective as the leak detection methods achieved using Method 21\nor OGI. Owners and operators seeking approval of an alternative technique must\nsubmit the following information to the Department: (1)\n\nDescribe the technology and, at a\nminimum, include information on: (i) Commercial availability of proposed alternative. (ii)\n\nOther approved applications or\nuses. (iii)\n\nReliability (ability to\ndetect emissions at a specified threshold and frequency, as well as identify or\ndetermine specific emission leak locations). (iv)\n\nCapable of identifying leaks and is at\nleast as effective as leak detection achieved using Method 21 or OGI\ndemonstrated through field test data and modeling. (v) Limitations/Restrictions (detection\nlimits, weather/temperature/moisture, maximum/minimum operating parameters, other). (vi)\n\nData quality\nindicators for precision and bias. (vii)\n\nQuality control and quality assurance\nprocedures for proper operation. (viii)\n\nDescribe how the technology\nworks. (ix)\n\nHow the technology\nquantifies emissions. (2)\n\nDescription of use, maintenance and\ncalibration. (i) Description of where, when\nand how the alternative technique will be used. (ii)\n\nUser guide. (iii)\n\nManufacturer-recommended maintenance\nand calibration. (iv)\n\nCalibration\nprocess. (3)\n\nProcess for\nrecordkeeping. (i) Frequency of data\nmeasurements. (ii)\n\nData logging\ncapabilities. (4)\n\nTraining documentation or program, including any ongoing support\nprovided. (5)\n\nProvide any\ndocumentation associated with field testing or modeling to demonstrate leak\ndetection is at least as effective as that achieved using Method 21 or\nOGI. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n203-7.1\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register February 16, 2022/Volume XLIV, Issue 07, eff. 3/3/2022\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
