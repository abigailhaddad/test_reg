  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 518.7 - Withholding of payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Basis for withholding. (1)\n\nThe department may withhold payments\nunder the program, in whole or in part, when it has determined that a provider\nhas abused the program or has committed an unacceptable practice. The\ndepartment's determination that a provider has abused the program, or has\ncommitted an unacceptable practice may consist of preliminary findings by the\ndepartment's audit or utilization review staff of unacceptable practices or\nsignificant overpayments, information from a State professional licensing or\ncertifying agency of an ongoing investigation of a provider involving fraud, abuse, professional misconduct or unprofessional conduct, or information from a\n\nState investigating or prosecutorial agency or other law enforcement\norganization of an ongoing investigation of a provider for fraud or criminal\nconduct involving the program. The department may withhold payment of current\nand future claims to the provider and any affiliate. (2)\n\nThe department must withhold payments\nunder the program, in whole or in part, when it has determined or has been\nnotified that a provider is the subject of a pending investigation of a\ncredible allegation of fraud unless the department finds good cause not to\nwithhold payments in accordance with\n42 C.F.R. 455.23. A credible allegation of fraud is an\nallegation that has indicia of reliability and has been verified by the\ndepartment, or the Medicaid fraud control unit, or another State agency, or law\nenforcement organization. (i) Whenever the\ndepartment initiates a withholding, in whole or in part, in relation to a\npending investigation of a credible allegation of fraud, the department must\nmake a fraud referral to the Medicaid fraud control unit. If the Medicaid fraud\ncontrol unit does not accept the referral, then the department may refer the\nmatter to another law enforcement organization. (ii)\n\nThe fraud referral made under this\nparagraph must be in writing and provided to the Medicaid fraud control unit or\nother law enforcement organization not later than the next business day after\nthe withhold is enacted. (b) Notice of the withholding will be given\nwithin five days of taking such action unless requested in writing by a law\nenforcement organization to delay such notice. The notice will describe the\nreasons for the action, but need not include specific information concerning an\nongoing investigation. (c) The\nnotice of withholding must: (1)\n(i) state that the payments are being\nwithheld in accordance with this section; and\n(ii)\nin cases where there is a pending\ninvestigation of a credible allegation of fraud state that the payments are\nbeing withheld in accordance with\n42 C.F.R. 455.23; (2)\nstate that the withholding is for a\ntemporary period only and recite the circumstances under which the withhold\nwill be terminated; (3)\nspecify\nwhether the withholding applies to all or only some claims and identify which\nclaims if not all claims are involved; and\n(4)\nadvise of the right to submit written\narguments and documentation in opposition to the withholding and how to submit\nthem in accordance with subdivision (e) of this section. (d) The withholding may continue only\ntemporarily. (1)\n\nWhen initiated by the\ndepartment prior to issuance of a draft audit report or notice of proposed\nagency action, the withholding will not continue for more than 90 days unless a\nwritten draft audit report or notice of proposed agency action is sent to the\nprovider. Issuance of the draft report or notice of proposed action may extend\nthe withholding until an amount reasonably calculated to satisfy the\noverpayment is withheld, pending a final determination on the matter. (2)\n\nWhen initiated by the department after\nissuance of a draft audit report or notice of proposed agency action, the\nwithholding will not continue for more than 90 days unless a written final\naudit report or notice of agency action is sent to the provider. Issuance of\nthe report or notice of action may extend the withholding until an amount\nreasonably calculated to satisfy the overpayment is withheld, pending a final\ndetermination on the matter. (3)\n\nWhen initiated by another State agency or law enforcement organization, the\nwithholding may continue until the agency or prosecuting authority determines\nthat there is insufficient evidence to support an action against the provider\nor its affiliate, or until the agency or criminal proceedings are\ncompleted. (4)\n\nWhen initiated by\nthe department when it has determined or has been notified that a provider is\nthe subject of a pending investigation of a credible allegation of fraud all\nwithholding actions will be temporary and will not continue after either of the\nfollowing: (i) The department, or the\n\nMedicaid fraud control unit, or other law enforcement organization determines\nthat there is insufficient evidence of fraud by the provider. (ii)\n\nLegal proceedings related to the\nprovider's alleged fraud are completed. (e) Appeals. (1)\nA provider or its affiliate that is the\nsubject of the withholding is not entitled to an administrative hearing, but\nmay, within 30 days of the date of the notice, submit written arguments and\ndocumentation that the withhold should be removed. (2)\n\nWithin 60 days of receiving written\narguments or documentation in response to a withhold, the department will\nreview the determination and notify the provider or its affiliate of the\nresults of that review. After the review, the determination to impose a\nwithhold may be affirmed, reversed or modified, in whole or in part. (3)\nA decision by the department to affirm, reverse or modify a withhold on appeal shall not be a determination of the\nmerits of any investigation initiated by another State agency, the Medicaid\nfraud control unit, or other law enforcement organization.
