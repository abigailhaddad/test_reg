  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2302.34 - Adoption of innovative programs\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe procedures and calendar which will be established and\nfollowed for the adoption of promising educational practices begin with: (a) Goals. Collectively, our department\nactivities and those of USOE are directed at the general goal of assisting\ndistricts in the identification of priority needs and assisting them to fund\nand adopt proven programs and practices in an efficient manner. An overall goal\nto which each of the above parts contributes is a more effective use of seed\nmoney through a wider adoption of successful programs and fewer attempts by\nmany districts to invent the same wheel. This goal includes the following\nobjectives: (1)\n\nTo identify and assign\npriorities among educational needs in individual districts and in New York\n\nState. Given the present State priorities as contained in commissioner's and\nregents priorities and goals as well as program and budget priorities, continuous revision is made necessary by annual statewide collection of data\nfrom public and nonpublic school districts; (2)\n\nTo identify sites where programs have\nbeen developed that successfully address those needs and to develop or\nencourage to be developed, new programs aimed at those needs in programs\ndeveloped under part C grants, and greatly increase the emphasis on\npracticality and low-cost replicability; (3)\n\nTo systematically collect specific and\nvalid information about those programs (for example: cost, objectives, results, activities, exportability, critical factors); (4)\n\nTo disseminate this information to school\ndistricts in New York State; (5)\n\nTo\nencourage via request-for-proposal the adoption of successful programs by other\nschool districts having related educational needs; (6)\n\nTo provide assistance to school districts\nas they adopt or adapt these programs. (b) Some of the procedures for adoption of\npromising educational practices follow: (1)\n\nIdentification of promising practices: (i) develop criteria to be used in the nomination of promising educational\npractices and products; (ii)\ndevelop procedures to be used in the nomination of promising educational\npractices and products; (iii)\ncooperate with appropriate local education agencies in the identification and\nnomination of promising educational practices and products. (2)\n\nValidation of promising\npractices: September 1977-June 1978\n(i) provide technical assistance to personnel of those projects that are identified\nas having promising practices and products and thereby prepare them for a\nvalidation process; (ii)\ndetermine\nappropriate procedures for LEA's to use in applying to have promising practices\nand products validated; (iii)\ndevelop criteria for selecting validation teams; (iv)\ndevelop and refine training experiences\nfor validation teams; (v) develop\nprocedures for on-site validation visits; (vi)\nprovide training for validation\nteams; (vii)\ndetermine formats for\nvalidation and reporting by validation teams; (viii)\ndevelop criteria procedures for State\ncertification of validated programs with promising practices and\nproducts. (3)\n\nDiffusion\nof validated practices in fiscal year 1978. When the SEA certifies that the\nvalidated programs or practices are worthy of consideration for\nadoption/adaption, New York State will: (i) recognize the validated programs for their accomplishments by appropriate\nmeans, such as: (a) a letter from the\ncommissioner, (b) special mention, or\n(c) a certificate. (ii)\nassist validated projects in\nthe development of various levels of awareness materials about promising\npractices and products; (iii)\nsponsor the publication of articles in professional journals concerning\nvalidated practices and products; (iv)\ndirect and encourage dissemination of\nawareness materials on validated practices and products; (v) encourage and support observation of\nvalidated programs in action; (vi)\ninitiate and encourage conferences and conversations (outside the actual\ninstructional setting) with participants of validated programs; (vii)\nmanage and facilitate the sharing of\ninstructional materials with potential adopters/adapters of validated practices\nand products; (viii)\nsupport the\ndevelopment of professional skills needed in the developer districts to prepare\npotential adopters/adapters for installation of programs and\npractices. (4)\n\nIdentification of potential adopters: July 1977-June 1978. (i) develop criteria for identification of\npotential adopters/adapters in consultation with producer LEA's; (ii)\ncirculate criteria for identification of\npotential adopters/adapters among LEA's of validated practices and products for\nadoption and/or modifications; (iii)\nsurvey and review regional and local\neducational needs; (iv)\ncollaborate\nwith appropriate units of the SEA in identification of potential consumers of\nvalidated practices and products; (v) assist producer LEA's in the\nidentification of potential adopters/adapters; (vi)\nassist and support LEA's with validated\nprograms in effecting linkage with potential adopters/adapters; (vii)\ndevelop criteria to determine depth and\nscope of interest of potential adopters/adapters that will lead to installation\nof validated practices and products; (viii)\nprovide guidelines for establishing\nproducer/consumer relationships that will lead to effective adoption/adaption\nof validated programs. (5)\n\nInstallation: Fall 1978-Spring 1979. Having identified, validated and diffused effective educational practices and\nproducts, New York State will bring about their installation by LEA's with the\nfollowing procedures: (i) provide or\nencourage workshops and on-site technical assistance to producer staffs on\npackaging of program materials and processes; (ii)\ndevelop a training program that will\nstimulate adoption/adaption and installation; (iii)\nassist consumer LEA's in start-up\nactivities of adopted/adapted programs; (iv)\nprovide continuous monitoring and\nsupport of all necessary installation activities that the adopter LEA's must\nfollow; (v) Evaluate the\neffectiveness of the producer/consumer system developed by the State. (c) A more elaborate\nset of functions or procedures for department and field units are suggested\nbelow: (1)\n\nThe optional education program\nfield representatives\n(i) continue to focus\non optional programs in the short run, but begin to shift their focus to\nwhatever programs are related to school district needs and department\npriorities; (ii)\nassume primary\nresponsibility for technical assistance in linking SED efforts with needs and\nactivities of school districts (play a dissemination agent role); (iii)\ncollect information about all aspects\nof the plan and aid districts to take advantage of their information and fiscal\nresources; (iv)\ncommunicate needs\nand problems of the field to SED, as related to the IV-C program, on a regular\nbasis; (v) continue to work toward\nthe goal of having their services supported locally through the funding of\ntheir activities by BOCES; (vi)\nassume facilitator role related to the National Diffusion Network and the\n\nState's Transferring Success System.
