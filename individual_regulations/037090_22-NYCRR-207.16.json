  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 207.16 - Petitions for probate and administration; proof of distribution; family tree\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All petitions for probate or administration shall: (1)\ncontain the information required by\nSCPA 304; (2)\ncontain\nan estimate of the gross estate of the decedent passing by will or intestacy, separately showing the values of personal and real property, gross rents for a\nperiod of 18 months and information about any cause of action for personal\ninjury or wrongful death; and\n(3)\nindicate whether any distributee is a\nnon-marital child or the issue of a non-marital person under E PTL 4-1.2(a)(1)\nor (2). (b) Whenever, in a petition for probate or administration, a party upon whom the\nservice of process is required is a distributee whose relationship to decedent\nis derived through another person who is deceased, the petition must either: (1)\nshow the relationship of the\ndistributee to decedent and the name and relationship of each person through\nwhom such distributee claims to be related to decedent; or\n(2)\nhave annexed a family tree\ntable or diagram showing the name, relationship and date of death of each\nperson through whom such distributee claims to be related to the decedent, which table or diagram shall be supported by an affidavit of a person having\nknowledge of the contents thereof. (c) If the petitioner alleges that the\ndecedent was survived by no distributee or only one distributee, or where the\nrelationship of distributees to the decedent is grandparents, aunts, uncles, first cousins or first cousins once removed, proof must be submitted to\nestablish: (1)\nhow each such\ndistributee is related to the decedent; and\n(2)\nthat no other persons of the same or\na nearer degree of relationship survived the decedent. Unless otherwise allowed by the court, the\nproof submitted pursuant to this subdivision must be by an affidavit or\ntestimony of a disinterested person. Unless otherwise allowed by the court, if\nonly one distributee survived the decedent, proof may not be given by the\nspouse or children of the distributee. The proof shall include as an exhibit a\nfamily tree, table or diagram, except no such table or diagram shall be\nrequired if the distributee is the spouse or only child of the decedent. (d) If the\npetitioner alleges that any of the distributees of the decedent or others\nrequired to be cited are unknown or that the names and addresses of some\npersons who are or may be distributees are unknown, petitioner must submit an\naffidavit showing that he or she has used due diligence in endeavoring to\nascertain the identity, names and addresses of all such persons. Compliance\nwith this due diligence requirement is not intended to burden the estate with\ncostly or overly time-consuming searches. Absent special circumstances, the\naffidavit will be deemed to satisfy the requirement of due diligence if it\nindicates the results obtained from among the following: (1)\nexamination of decedent's personal\neffects, including address books; (2)\ninquiry of decedent's relatives, neighbors, friends, former business associates and employers, the post office\nand financial institutions; (3)\ncorrespondence to the last known\naddress of any missing distributees; (4)\ncorrespondence or telephone calls to, or internet search for, persons of same or similar name in the area where the\nperson being sought lived; (5)\nexamination of the records of the\n\nMotor Vehicle Bureau and Board of Elections of the state or county of the\nlast-known address of the person whose whereabouts is unknown. In probate proceedings, the court may accept, in lieu of the above, an affidavit by decedent setting forth the efforts that\nhe or she made to ascertain relatives. (e) If a person requesting\nletters to administer an estate as sole executor or administrator is also an\nattorney admitted in this State, he or she shall file with the petition\nrequesting letters a statement disclosing: (1)\nthat the fiduciary is an\nattorney; (2)\nwhether\nthe fiduciary or the law firm with which he or she is affiliated will act as\ncounsel; and\n(3)\nif\napplicable, that the fiduciary was the draftsperson of a will offered for\nprobate with respect to that estate.
