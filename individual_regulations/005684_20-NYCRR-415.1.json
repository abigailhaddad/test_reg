  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 415.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 289-c\n(a) The motor fuel tax imposed by article\n12-A of the Tax Law, though payable by the distributor, is borne by the\npurchaser and when paid by the distributor is deemed to have been paid for the\naccount of the purchaser. No person may sell, advertise, or offer for sale\nmotor fuel, separate from the tax imposed. For purposes of this Part, it is\npresumed that the motor fuel tax is included in the price paid by the purchaser\nwhen the price paid is not less than the amount of such tax. (b) The intent of the motor fuel tax is to\nplace the ultimate burden resulting from such tax, so far as possible, on those\npersons, not otherwise exempt from the tax, who use the public highways of New\n\nYork State for operating motor vehicles thereon or such persons who use the\nwaterways of the State for operating pleasure or recreational motor boats\nthereon. Refunds, credits and reimbursements of tax paid on motor fuel may be\nobtained by filing claims therefor as provided in these regulations. (c) (1)\n\nUnless otherwise provided in this Part, a claim for refund, credit or\nreimbursement must be filed with the Department of Taxation and Finance within\nthree years from: (i) the date of the\npurchase, in the case of the purchaser; or\n(ii)\nthe date of the sale, in the case of the\nseller, of the motor fuel so subject to refund, credit or\nreimbursement. (2)\n(i) Except as provided for in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, all refunds and reimbursements claimed with reference\nto motor fuel purchased or sold during any calendar month must be included in a\nsingle application and a claimant may include two or more months in a single\ntimely application. (ii)\nA\ndistributor of motor fuel selling motor fuel to a governmental entity without\npassing through the motor fuel tax (as provided in article 12-A of the Tax Law\nand section\n414.2\nof\nthis Title), may apply for a refund of the tax on these sales on a weekly, in\naddition to a monthly, basis. If the period covered by the refund application\nis a period of less than one month, the period must begin and end in the same\ncalendar month. (d) A refund, credit or reimbursement of the\nmotor fuel tax, or any portion thereof, will be allowed only to the extent that\nthe claimant has paid, assumed or has had passed through to it such motor fuel\ntax.
