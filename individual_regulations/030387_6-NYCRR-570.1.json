  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 570.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purpose. The purpose of this Part is to establish criteria for the\nsiting of liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities and to require that such\nfacilities obtain a permit from the Department pursuant to Article 23, Title 17\nof the Environmental Conservation Law to protect the public health and the\nenvironment of New York State (the State). (b) Applicability. This Part\napplies throughout the State subject to the restrictions identified in section\n570.9\nof this Part. Unless\nspecifically exempted pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section, owners and\noperators of LNG facilities must comply with this Part. LNG transportation\nactivities do not require a permit issued under this Part; however, except for\ntransportation by navigable waterways, intrastate transportation of LNG is\nprohibited unless the intrastate transportation route has been certified as set\nforth in section\n570.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart. Storage or transportation of natural gas in the vapor state, under\npressure or not, is not subject to this Part. (c) Definitions. For the\npurposes of this Part, the following definitions apply: (1)\n\"Aboveground storage tank\" or \"AST\" means\nany tank that is not an underground storage tank. (2)\n\"Authority having jurisdiction\" means the\nlocal government, county government, or State agency responsible for the\nadministration and enforcement of applicable regulation or law. (3)\n\"Department\" means the New York State\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation. (4)\n\"Facility capacity\" means the sum of the\ndesign capacities for each tank or other storage device (e.g., a tank trailer\nused for storage and not for an LNG transportation activity) at the LNG\nfacility. (5)\n\"Interstate transport\nof LNG\" means the transportation of LNG between a point in New York State and a\npoint in another state or a foreign country, in either direction; or between\npoints in New York State through another state or foreign country; or between\npoints in other states or foreign countries through New York State. (6)\n\"Intrastate transport of LNG\" means the\ntransportation of LNG other than as described in the definition of \"interstate\ntransport of LNG.\"\n(7)\n\"L/CNG,\"\nalso known as \"liquefied to compressed natural gas,\" means LNG which may be\ndispensed from its container as either a liquid (LNG) or as compressed natural\ngas (CNG). (8)\n\"Liquefied natural\ngas,\" or \"LNG,\" means natural gas or synthetic gas composed primarily of\nmethane (CH4) cooled to its liquid state. For the purposes of this Part, LNG\nshall not mean liquefied petroleum gas. (9)\n\"Liquefied natural gas facility\" or \"LNG\nfacility\" means any structure or facility located on one or more contiguous or\nadjacent properties under common control that is used to store LNG in a tank\nsystem, or other storage device or to convert LNG into natural gas. (10)\n\"Liquefied natural gas transportation\nactivity\" or \"LNG transportation activity\" means the loading, unloading, or\ntransportation, by whatever means, of LNG. (11)\n\"NFPA\" means the National Fire\n\nProtection Association, or its successor. (12)\n\"Natural gas\" means a fuel consisting of\na mixture of mostly methane (CH4) gas, other hydrocarbon gases, and trace\namounts of non-hydrocarbon gases, which is stored and transported in a vapor\nstate and under a wide range of pressures. (13)\n\"Operator\" means any person who\noperates, controls, or supervises an LNG facility or who is responsible for the\noperation. (14)\n\"Out-of-service,\"\nin relation to an LNG facility or portion thereof, means no longer receiving or\ndispensing LNG. (15)\n\"Owner\" means\nany person who owns or has legal or equitable title to an LNG\nfacility. (16)\n\"Permit\" means an\n\"environmental safety permit\" issued by the Department pursuant to Article 23, Title 17 of the Environmental Conservation Law and this Part. (17)\n\"Person\" means any individual, corporation, partnership, association, cooperative or otherwise, trust or\nestate, governmental agency, authority, public benefit corporation, municipality or agency thereof, board or commission, or other public or private\nlegal entity. (18)\n\"Pre-existing\nfacility\" means an LNG facility in actual use and operation on September 1, 1976 that is exempt from the permit requirements of this Part and operates\npursuant to a Department order. (19)\n\"SEQRA\" means the State Environmental\n\nQuality Review Act set forth in Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw, and implemented by Part 617 of this Title. (20)\n\"Spill\" or \"spillage\" means any escape\nof LNG in liquid form from the containers employed in the normal course of\nstorage, transfer, processing, or use of LNG. (21)\n\"Statement of compliance\" means a\ntwo-part document containing the following components. In part one, a\n\nState-licensed Professional Engineer authorized to practice engineering in the\n\nState pursuant to Article 145 the State Education Law, on behalf of an\napplicant for a permit, attests by signature and seal that the design of the\nproposed LNG facility meets the applicable provisions of Federal Pipeline\n\nSafety standards, applicable provisions of the Public Service Commission's\nregulations in 16 NYCRR, and the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code of\nthe State. In part two, the owner of the facility attests that the facility\nwill be operated in accordance with all applicable law, regulations, standards, and requirements. (22)\n\"Tank\" means\nthe main storage container of a tank system. Each section of a compartmented\ntank will be treated as an individual tank. (23)\n\"Tank design capacity\" means the nominal\namount of LNG that a tank is designed to hold as determined by the tank\nmanufacturer. If a certain portion of a tank is unable to store LNG (for\nexample, electrical equipment or other interior components take up space), the\ndesign capacity of the tank is thereby reduced. (24)\n\"Tank system\" means a stationary device\ndesigned to store LNG that is constructed of non-earthen materials that provide\nstructural support. This term includes all associated piping and ancillary\nequipment. (25)\n\"Underground\nstorage tank\" or \"UST\" means a tank for which ten percent or more of the tank\ndesign capacity is beneath the surface of the ground. This term does not\ninclude a tank situated in an underground vault or other area making the tank\nfully available for inspection. (d) Exemptions. For the purposes\nof this Part, the following exemptions apply: (1)\n\nAn on-board LNG fuel tank used to power\nan LNG-fueled vehicle or vessel shall not constitute an LNG facility. (2)\nLNG delivery tank trucks, when attached\nto a natural gas pipeline for the purpose of short-term pipeline-pressure\nregulation, shall not constitute LNG facilities if such tank trucks remain\nconnected to the pipeline for less than 72 hours per event, and no more\nfrequently than one such event during any thirty (30) day period. (3)\n\nThe movement of LNG within the boundaries\nof an LNG facility shall not constitute intrastate transport of LNG. (4)\n\nThe movement of an LNG-fueled vehicle or\nvessel with an on-board LNG fuel tank used to power such vehicle or vessel\nshall not constitute intrastate transport of LNG. (5)\nA pre-existing facility may continue to\noperate, without the need to obtain a permit, provided that: i)\nthere are no new LNG storage tanks, tank\nsystem design changes, or operational modifications, including any that result\nin an increase in the on-site LNG facility capacity; ii)\na corporate officer of the owner with\noverall responsibility for the operation of the facility signs and submits part\ntwo of a statement of compliance (as defined in §570.l(c)(21)) to the\n\nDepartment within one year of the effective date of this Part, and every five\nyears thereafter; and\niii)\nthe\nfacility remains in compliance with the terms of any LNG-related Department\norders issued pursuant to Article 23, Title 17 of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law. (6)\n\nThe\ndelivery of LNG to alleviate an emergency, as defined in section\n621.2\n(j) of this\n\nTitle, shall not constitute intrastate transport of LNG, if the Department has\nissued an emergency authorization pursuant to section\n621.12\nof this Title. For the\nduration of such emergency, the equipment used to convert LNG into natural gas\nshall not constitute an LNG facility, unless such equipment is already an LNG\nfacility under this Part. In an emergency, the requirements of section\n621.12\nof this Title must be\nmet. (e) Severability. If any provision of this Part or its application to\nany person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Part, and the\napplication of those provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be\naffected. (f) Enforcement.
