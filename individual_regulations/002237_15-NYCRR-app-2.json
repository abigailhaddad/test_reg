If the tax or any part thereof due, under the local law, be not paid when required, the amount of tax due shall be\ndetermined by the commissioner of finance of the city of New York, from such\ninformation as may be obtainable, including motor vehicle registration with the\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles of the State of New York and/or other factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person\nagainst whom it is assessed, within 30 days after the giving of such notice of\ndetermination, shall apply for a hearing or unless, of his own motion, the\ncommissioner of finance shall redetermine the same. After such hearing, the\ncommissioner of finance shall give notice of the determination of such\napplication to the person against whom the tax is assessed. Such determination\nshall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other\nreason whatsoever by a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law\nand Rules if application therefor is made to the Supreme Court within four\nmonths after the giving of the notice of such determination. A proceeding under\narticle 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall not be instituted unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties\nand interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of\nfinance, and there shall be filed with the commissioner of finance an\nundertaking issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this\n\nState and approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this State as to\nsolvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the Supreme Court\nshall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax\nconfirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in\nthe prosecution of the proceeding; or\n(b) at the option of the applicant such undertaking filed with\nthe commissioner of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such determination plus the costs and\ncharges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in\nwhich event the applicant shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application. 2. Refunds. a. In the manner provided in this paragraph, the commissioner\nof finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or\ninterest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if\napplication or such refund shall be made, within one year from the payment\nthereof, to the commissioner of finance. Whenever a refund is made, the reasons\ntherefor shall be stated in writing by the commissioner of finance, who, in\nlieu of any refund, may allow credit therefor on payments due from the\napplicant. b. An application for a refund or credit made as herein\nprovided shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or\ninterest complained of and the commissioner of finance shall hold a hearing and\nreceive evidence with respect thereto. After such hearing, the commissioner of\nfinance shall give notice of the determination of such application to the\napplicant, who shall be entitled to review such determination by a proceeding\npursuant to article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, provided such\nproceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of notice of such\ndetermination, and provided that a final determination of tax due was not\npreviously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted unless an\nundertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance, in such amount and with\nsuch sureties as a justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect\nthat if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will\npay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such\nproceeding. c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or\ncredit under this paragraph of a tax, interest or penalty which has been\ndetermined to be due pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1, where he has\nhad a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said paragraph, or has failed to avail himself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or\ncredit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination\nmade pursuant to paragraph 1, unless it be found that such determination was\nerroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper after a hearing, or on his own motion, by the commissioner of finance, as the case may be, or in\na proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, pursuant to\nthe provisions of said section, in which event, refund or credit without\ninterest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been\noverpaid. 3. Reserves. In cases where a taxpayer has applied for a refund\nand has instituted a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules to review a determination adverse to him on his application for refund, the commissioner of finance shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any\ndecision adverse to the city. 4. Remedies exclusive. The remedies provided by paragraphs 1\nand 2 shall be exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax\nliability imposed by the local law; and no determination or proposed\ndetermination of tax or determination on any application for refund shall be\nenjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money\nhad and received, or by any action or proceeding other than a proceeding in the\nnature of a certiorari proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law\nand Rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory\njudgment if he institutes suit within 30 days after a deficiency assessment is\nmade and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of\nfinance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as\nprovided in paragraph 1. 5. Proceedings to recover tax. a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or\ninterest imposed by the local law, the corporation counsel, upon the request of\nthe commissioner of finance, shall bring or cause to be brought an action to\nenforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court\nof the State of New York or of any other state of the United States. However, if, in his discretion, the commissioner of finance believes that any such\nperson subject to the provisions of the local law is about to cease business, leave the State or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or\npenalty might be satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid\nwhen due, he may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable\nand may issue a warrant immediately. b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of\nfinance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding him to\nlevy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person liable for the\ntax which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to\nreturn such warrant to the person who issued it and to pay to him the money\ncollected by virtue thereof within 60 days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file\nwith the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in\njudgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount\nof the tax, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date\nwhen such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall\nbecome a lien upon the title to and the interest in real and personal property\nof the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then\nproceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as that\nprovided by law in respect to execution issued against property upon judgments\nof a court of record, and for services in executing he shall be entitled to the\nsame fees, which he may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the\ncommissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued\nand directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance of the\ncity, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the\npowers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or\ncompensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such\nduty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of\nfinance may, from time to time, issue new warrants and shall also have the same\nremedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if he had recovered judgment\ntherefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied. 6. Administration of oaths and compelling testimony. a. The commissioner of finance or his employees or agents duly\ndesignated and authorized by him shall have power to administer oaths and take\naffidavits in relation to any matter or proceeding in the exercise of the\npowers and duties hereunder. The commissioner of finance shall have power to\nsubpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents to secure information pertinent to the performance of his\nduties hereunder and of the enforcement of the local laws and to examine them\nin relation thereto, and to issue commissions for the examination of witnesses\nwho are out of the State or unable to attend before him or excused from\nattendance. b. A justice of the Supreme Court either in court or at\nchambers shall have power summarily to enforce by proper proceedings the\nattendance and testimony of witnesses and production and examination of books, papers and documents called for by the subpoena of the commissioner of\nfinance. c. Any person who shall refuse to testify or to produce books\nor records or who shall testify falsely in any material matter pending before\nthe commissioner of finance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishment for\nwhich shall be a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than\nsix months, or both such fine and imprisonment. d. The officers who serve the summons or subpoena of the\ncommissioner of finance, and witnesses attending in response thereto, shall be\nentitled to the same fees as are allowed to officers and witnesses in civil\ncases in courts of record, except as herein otherwise provided. Such officers\nshall be the city sheriff and his duly appointed deputies or any officers or\nemployees of the department of finance of the city designated by the\ncommissioner of finance to serve such process. 7. Penalties and interest. a. Any person failing to file a return or to pay any tax or any\nportion thereof within the time required by the local law shall be subject to a\npenalty of five times the amount of the tax due, plus interest of five percent\nof such tax for each month of delay or fraction thereof, but the commissioner\nof finance, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any\npart of such penalty, but not interest at the rate of six percent per year. Penalties and interest shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as\nother revenues under the local law. Unpaid penalties and interest may be\nenforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by the local law. b. The certificate of the commissioner of finance to the effect\nthat a tax has not been paid, or that a return required by the local law has\nnot been filed, or that information has not been supplied pursuant to the\nprovisions of the local law shall be presumptive evidence thereof. 8. Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of\nthe local law may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is\nintended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given\nin the last registration filed by him pursuant to the provisions of the local\nlaw, in any application for registration made by him pursuant to section\n401\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law or, if no registration has been filed or\napplication made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of\nsuch notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the\nperson to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to\nthe provisions of the local law by the giving of notice shall commence to run\nfrom the date of mailing of such notice. b. The provisions of the Civil Practice Law and Rules or any\nother law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy\nshall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the commissioner of\nfinance to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any\ntax or penalty provided by this Title. However, except in the case of a\nwillfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no\nassessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than\nthree years from the date of the filing of an application for registration; provided, however, that where no application has been filed as provided by law, the tax may be assessed at any time. c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein\nfor the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing\nthat such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax may be\ndetermined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may\nbe further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the\nexpiration of the extended period. 9. Commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance, in\naddition to the powers elsewhere granted to him in the local law, is hereby\nauthorized and empowered: a. to delegate such functions and powers to a deputy\ncommissioner or assistant commissioner in the department of finance, or to any\nemployee or employees of the department of finance; b. for cause shown, to remit penalties and to compromise\ndisputed claims, in connection with the taxes hereby imposed; c. to request information concerning motor vehicles and persons\nsubject to the provisions of this Title from the department of motor vehicles\nof any other state or the Treasury Department of the United States, or any city\nor county of the State of New York; and to afford such information to such\nother state, Treasury Department, city or county, any provision of this Title\nto the contrary notwithstanding; and\nd. to request the police department of the city to assist in\nthe enforcement of the provisions of this Title.
