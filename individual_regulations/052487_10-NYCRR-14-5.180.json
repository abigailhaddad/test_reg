  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 14-5.180 - Permits; application, issuance, inspection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A valid permit, issued by the permit-issuing official having jurisdiction is required for lawful operation of a food vending machine commissary, a food vending operation or controlled location vending machine. At establishments that serve retail frozen desserts the $25 permit fee imposed by Public Health Law, section 225(5)(s) shall be paid at the time any other permit fees related to the operation of the food service establishment are collected by the permit-issuing official and the establishment's permit shall indicate that the facility can manufacture and sell retail frozen desserts. (b) The term permit-issuing official means the health commissioner or health officer of a city of 50,000 population or over, the health commissioner or health officer of a county or part-county health district, the State regional health director or area district director having jurisdiction, a grade I or grade II public health administrator qualified and appointed pursuant to Part 11 of this Title, a public health director or any county health director having all the powers and duties prescribed in section\n352\nof the Public Health Law. The health commissioner or health officer of a city of 50,000 population or over, or the health commissioner or health officer of a county or part-county health district or such grade I or grade II public health administrator or public health director or county health director may designate the director of environmental health of such district; and the State regional health director or area director may designate the district director as additional persons to issue the permits required by this Subpart. (c) Not less than 21 days before starting a food vending commissary, an application for a permit is to be submitted to the permit-issuing official having jurisdiction. This application is to be completed in full on forms acceptable to the permit-issuing official. The application is to include the proposed and existing location of all food vending machines. (d) A permit will be issued subject to the food vending commissary and food vending operations being operated in compliance with this Subpart and not presenting a danger to the health of the consumer or to the public. An applicant's past history of compliance or noncompliance will be a consideration in evaluating each of the previously mentioned criteria. The condition of the vending machines, commissary, its equipment, utensils, personnel, mode of operation, surroundings, water supply, sewage disposal, waste handling, furnishings, food and appurtenances are all factors in determining whether its continued operation may affect public health. After making the preliminary inspection, a permit may be issued or the operator advised of violations prohibiting issuance of such permit by the permit-issuing official. (e) It is unlawful for a food vending commissary or food vending machine operator to operate without a permit during the 21 days from the time a permit has been requested. In the event the permit-issuing official or his designated representative does not make an inspection of the commissary or food vending operation during this 21-day period, operation may commence without being in violation of this Subpart until such time as the permit-issuing official or his designated representative makes an inspection and issues a permit or issues an order to cease operation for cause. (f) The designated representative of the permit-issuing official is a person authorized to perform inspections of commissaries and food vending operations on behalf of the permit-issuing official. Persons authorized to make inspections are to complete required inspection report forms and to take mandated enforcement actions required by this Subpart. (g) Each food vending machine which is coin- or token-operated is to have the name, address and telephone number of the person responsible for its operation posted to be readily visible to anyone operating the machine.
