  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 329.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section\n111\n(a) of the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, as added by chapter 947 of the Laws of 1956, and section\n412\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, as added by chapter 1000 of the Laws of 1966, provide that in any case\nwhere the Retirement System is required by order of a court of competent\njurisdiction to pay over a benefit which is payable in installments, and which\nis predicated upon the life of a beneficiary to a payee other than the\nrecipient who ordinarily would have taken the benefit pursuant to the\nprovisions of this Article, such payee must file a bond indemnifying the\n\nComptroller against loss by reason of excess payments to such payee. Experience\nhas shown that it is virtually impossible for the payee to secure such bonds\nfrom surety companies. (b) Section\n14\nof\nthe General Construction Law provides that whenever a provision of law requires\nthe filing of a bond, the execution of an undertaking to the same effect should\nbe deemed compliance (Burns v. Watertown, 213 N.Y.S. 90; Tully v. Lewitz, 198\nN.Y.S. 829). The term undertaking is defined in section\n2501\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules to\nbe any instrument which evidences an agreement by any person to be bound in a\nstated amount upon the failure of the condition of the instrument. To lessen\nthe burden of securing a surety bond, compliance with the mandates of sections\n111-a\nand\n412\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw may be had by the filing of an indemnification agreement prepared by the\n\nComptroller. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n329.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
