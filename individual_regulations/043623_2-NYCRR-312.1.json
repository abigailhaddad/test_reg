  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 312.1 - Background and determination\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhereas, Since the inception of the New York State Employees'\nRetirement System and of the New York State Policemen's and Firemen's\n\nRetirement System, an ordinary death benefit has been payable upon the death in\nservice of a member thereof, the authority for such benefit being found in\nsections\n60, 60-a, 60-b, 360, 360-a, 360-b, 448, 508\nand\n606\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw; and\n\nWhereas, This benefit represents a valuable and important\nfactor in estate planning by the members, and is very often the most\nsignificant or sole asset whereby the member provides for his designated\nbeneficiaries in the event of his death while in service; and\n\nWhereas, Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the receipt of such benefit may pose unfavorable income tax consequences for\nbeneficiaries; and\n\nWhereas, The Legislature of the State of New York, by the\nenactment of chapter 336 and 371, Laws of 1969, chapter 581, Laws of 1970, chapters 28 and 909, Laws of 1971, chapter 510, Laws of 1974, and chapter 339, Laws of 1978, has authorized and directed the State Comptroller to take such\nsteps as are necessary to afford the ordinary death benefit provided by the\n\nRetirement and Social Security Law in the form of group life insurance, upon a\ndetermination by him that to do so would guarantee a more favorable tax\ntreatment of the benefit to beneficiaries of members on whose behalf such\nbenefit is payable, thereby declaring it to be the public policy of the State\nof New York that members be covered by group life insurance upon such\ndetermination; and\n\nWhereas, in 1995 the Comptroller engaged the consulting firm\nof Peat Marwick LLP to determine whether such favorable tax treatment could\nalso be afforded by paying post-retirement death benefits payable to\nbeneficiaries of members of the New York State and Local Retirement System\nunder sections\n448, 508\nand\n606\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw in the form of group life insurance, and whereas by letter dated April 27, 1995, Peat Marwick determined that the pertinent provisions of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code and applicable regulations permitted such treatment of\npost-retirement death benefits; and\n\nWhereas, Recent studies show that approximately 80 percent of\nthe total United States working force (excluding agricultural and governmental\nemployees) are covered by employer-sponsored group life insurance plans, indicating a strong trend toward this form of employee benefit; it is, therefore, hereby\n\nDetermined, That to afford group term life insurance to\nmembers of the New York State Employees' Retirement System and the New York\n\nState Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement System will guarantee a more\nfavorable tax treatment to the beneficiaries of such members, as appears more\nparticularly from the appended rulings of the Internal Revenue Service dated\n\nDecember 31, 1969 (see Appendix 11, infra), and February 18, 1971, (see\n\nAppendix 11-A, infra); and it is hereby\n\nDirected, That group term life insurance shall be provided\ncovering the death of members of the New York State Employee's Retirement\n\nSystem and the New York State Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement System, as\nprovided below.
