  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 151.20 - Signaling lift bridges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When\napproaching a lift bridge, float operators intending to pass under the bridge\ncan contact the bridge operator via marine band radio 13, or by three distinct\nblasts or soundings of a horn, whistle, or other signaling device. Such contact\nor signal must be given at least 1,000 feet from the bridge. Bridge operators\nwill reply with navigation lights, horn or whistle. Green lights indicate that\nthe bridge is raised and ready and the float may advance. Red lights indicate\nthat the float must wait. Where the bridge operator responds by horn or\nwhistle, three distinct blasts indicate the float may advance. Six rapid blasts\nmean that the float shall come to an immediate stop and await further\ninstructions. (b) No float operator\nshall proceed under a movable bridge until the bridge is fully raised and the\nbridge operator has given the signal to proceed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n151.20\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
