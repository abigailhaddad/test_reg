Its eleven sections\nmay or may not apply to all cases. Before completing the form, carefully\nconsider the status of the individual petitioner completing the testimony and\nhis/her relationship to the respondent, the relief you plan to request in the\npetition, and other case characteristics to determine what information should\nbe provided. (Note: all section headings contain a a check box to be used when\nadditional comments/remarks are desired or required. These comments/remarks\nshould be placed in Section X.) As a general rule, requests for relief require\ncompletion of the following sections: Section No. Description\n\nCase Type Requiring\n\nCompletion\nI\nPersonal Information About Child(ren)'s\n\nMother\n\nAll\nII\nPersonal Information About Child(ren)'s\n\nFather\n\nAll\nIII\nCaretaker's Personal Information\n\nCases where the caretaker is an individual\nother than the child(ren)'s parent\nIV\nLegal Relationship of Parents\n\nAll\nV\nDependent Child(ren) in this Action\n\nAll\nVI\nMedical Insurance\n\nAll, except non-Public Assistance, non-Medicaid\ncases where applicant requests that medical support not be sought\nVII\nSupport Order and Payment\n\nInformation\n\nAll cases where an order for support has been\nentered\n\nPage 6a\n\nObligor's Payment History\n\nAll cases where an order for support has been\nentered; however, a certified copy of the court or agency payment history may\nbe attached in lieu of Page 6a\nVIII\nObligee's Public Assistance Status\n\nCases where the obligee received public\nassistance\nIX\nFinancial Information\n\nEstablishment and modification cases, as\nrequired by State's guidelines\nX\nOther Pertinent Information\n\nWhen needed (Note: all section headings contain\na check box to be used when additional comments/remarks are desired or\nrequired.)\nXI\nVerification\n\nAll\nHEADING/CAPTION: Identify the petitioner and respondent in\nthe appropriate spaces. Check the appropriate space to identify\nthe type of case: IV-D Non Public Assistance; IV-D Non Public Assistance\n\nMedicaid (indicate whether receiving Full Child Support Services or Medical\n\nServices Only); IV-D Public Assistance; IV-D Foster Care (IV-E); or Non IV-D. IV-D means the case is being worked by the State or local child support\nenforcement agency (i.e., IV-D agency). Public Assistance means the obligee's\nfamily receives IV-A cash payments [IV-A was formerly called Aid to Families\nwith Dependent Children (AFDC) and is now called Temporary Family\n\nAssistance]. ____________\nInstructions for General Testimony--Page\n1\nIV-D Non Public Assistance means that the\nobligee applied for child support enforcement services but is not receiving\npublic assistance (IV-A cash payments). IV-D Non Public Assistance Medicaid means\nthat the obligee is not receiving public assistance (IV-A cash payments) but is\nreceiving Medicaid. Medicaid is a federally-funded program that provides\nmedical support for low income families. These cases can receive \"Full\n\nServices\" or \"Medical Services Only\". IV-D Public Assistance means the obligee\nis receiving IV-A cash payments [IV-A was formerly called Aid to Families with\n\nDependent Children (AFDC) and is now called Temporary Family Assistance]. In\nexchange for receiving benefits, a person receiving public assistance agrees to\n\"assign her support rights\" or to turn over to the State any right to child\nsupport payments paid by the obligated parent. IV-E Foster Care means the child is in\nIV-E foster care and the case has been referred to the State/local child\nsupport agency to obtain support from the parents. Non IV-D means the case is a private case\nthat is not being worked by the State or local child support enforcement or\nIV-D agency. Under \"Responding IV-D Case No.\" and\n\"Responding Docket No.\", enter appropriate case and docket numbers that the\nresponding State uses to identify the case, if applicable and if known. Under\n\"docket number\", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other\nappropriate reference number. Under \"Initiating IV-D Case No.\" and\n\"Initiating Docket No.\", enter appropriate case and docket numbers which your\nIV-D agency or local tribunal has assigned to the case. Under \"docket number\", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate\nreference number. Check the appropriate boxes to indicate\nwhether the petitioner is the \"Obligee\", \"Obligor\", or \"Caretaker Other than\n\nParent\", or whether this is a \"Foster Care\" case. Check the appropriate boxes\nfor the Respondent as well. Obligee is the individual or State agency\nwho is owed or is alleged to be owed support. If an obligee receives public\nassistance, she assigns her support rights to the State. Obligor is the individual who owes or is\nalleged to owe support. This term includes alleged or putative fathers whose\npaternity of the child(ren) has not yet been established. Caretaker Other than Parent is an\nindividual who is custodian of the child(ren) but who is not the mother or\nfather of the child(ren). Foster Care indicates that the child is in\nfoster care. In such cases, a State or political subdivision may seek support\nfrom both parents. In the name-block immediately above\nsection I, fill in the name (First, Middle, Last) of the individual providing\nthe testimony and signing the form. In most cases this will be the individual\nobligee. However, it could also be an obligor seeking paternity establishment\nor modification of a support order, or an authorized child support worker if\nthe form is completed with information from the file. Note that verification by\nan individual petitioner is required for information personally known to\nhim/her and that testimony is given under penalty of perjury. ____________\nInstructions for General Testimony--Page\n2\nSECTION I, PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT\nCHILD(REN)'S MOTHER: This section asks for information about the child(ren)'s\nmother.

SECTION VIII, OBLIGEE'S PUBLIC ASSISTANCE\nSTATUS: Complete this section only if: You are seeking support for a prior period\nand public assistance was paid, or\n\nYou are seeking reimbursement for medical\ncosts. Otherwise, skip to section IX, Financial\n\nInformation. Complete items 1 and 2 only if you are\nseeking support for a prior period (i.e., if you are seeking \"back support\" or\nsupport for a period prior to the establishment of the order). The award of\nsupport for a prior period is not required under Federal law but may be\nappropriate in accordance with State law. Not all States have authority to\nestablish support orders for prior periods. However, the period of time the\nfamily received public assistance may be a relevant factor in setting an award\nfor a prior period; this section provides spaces for this information. States may not, as a\nfederally-reimbursable function, establish judgments solely for reimbursement\nof public assistance, or pursue enforcement of such judgments established after\n\nMarch 22, 1993. States must use guidelines as a rebuttable presumption, not the\namount of unreimbursed public assistance, in establishing orders after October\n13, 1989. States may establish child support awards covering a prior period, but such awards must be based on guidelines and take into consideration either\nthe current earnings and income at the time the order is set, or the obligor's\nearnings and income during the prior period. Item 1: If known, specify the period of\ntime when public assistance was paid tot he obligee's family, and the State\nwhich provided the assistance and had an assignment of support rights. Only\nconsider public assistance paid to the obligee or the children in this action\n(listed in section V).

Enter the dollar amount of medical expenses for which you are\nseeking reimbursement. Enter the name of the agency or person who paid the\nmedical expenses and is due reimbursement. Attach appropriate proof of\ndocumentation, such as receipts. ____________\nInstructions for General Testimony--Page\n12\nSECTION IX, FINANCIAL INFORMATION: This\nsection is used to obtain information needed to apply guidelines to determine\nthe appropriate amount of support. Generally, you only need to complete this\nsection if you are requesting establishment of an order or modification of an\nexisting order, unless a responding State specifically asks for Section IX to\nbe completed to enforce an order. It is important to disclose all the\ninformation pertaining to income, expenses, and assets, as required by the\nresponding State's guidelines. Failure to disclose information may seriously\naffect the legal proceedings in the responding State and may unnecessarily\ndelay the resolution of the support issue. However, before completing all parts of\n\nSection IX you may wish to consult the Interstate Roster and Referral Guide or\nto contact the responding State to determine if all parts of Section IX are\nneeded. Some responding States do not need all of the information in Section\nIX. You need to complete only those parts needed by the responding\n\nState.

If you are sending this case to a\n\nState that uses the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), you will\ngenerally need to attach two copies, one of which is certified, of any support\norder. If you are sending this case to a State that uses a version of the\n\nUniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), you will generally need\nto attach three certified copies of any support order. Note, however, that some\nresponding States may be able to take certain administrative enforcement\nactions (e.g., interstate wage withholding) without having a certified copy of\nthe order, although a regular copy is still necessary. Some States may also\nneed copies of custody or change in custody orders, if relevant. ____________\nInstructions for General Testimony--Page\n16\n\nCheck the other boxes to indicate any\nother items that are attached, including: a copy of the certified child support\npayment records; copies of the three most recent paystubs from the current\nemployer; copies of bills for prenatal, postnatal, or general health care of\nmother and child; assignment or subrogation of support rights; \"Affidavit in\n\nSupport of Establishing Paternity\"; copy of child(ren)'s birth certificates; an\nacknowledgment of parentage; and any other attachments (such as copies of bills\nfor parentage testing or the common law statute of the initiating\n\nState). \"Affidavit in Support of Establishing\n\nPaternity\" is a standard interstate form completed by the moving party [usually\nchild(ren)'s mother or alleged father] who is seeking to establish the alleged\nfather's paternity of the child(ren). The form provides evidence regarding the\nfather's paternity. In interstate cases, a separate form must be completed for\neach child whose paternity is at issue. \"Acknowledgment of Parentage\" is an\naffidavit or form signed by the alleged father (and usually the mother as well)\nvoluntarily acknowledging the alleged father's paternity of the child(ren). These forms are used by hospital-based programs, State child support agencies, and other entities. If the individual petitioner is indigent\nand unable to pay the costs of these proceedings, check the \"Other\" checkbox\nand provide an explanation on the line provided. Note that checking this box\ndoes not guarantee that the individual petitioner will be exempt from all costs\nand fees. The person(s) providing the testimony --\nthe individual petitioner and/or agency representative -- should sign and date\nthe testimony at the bottom of page 10. Some States require the individual\npetitioner's signature; check with the Interstate Roster and Referral Guide or\nthe responding State to determine the responding State's requirements. The form\ncontains space for a notary to authenticate the signatures. **************************************************\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis information collection is conducted\nin accordance with\n45 CFR\n303.7\nof the child support enforcement\nprogram.
