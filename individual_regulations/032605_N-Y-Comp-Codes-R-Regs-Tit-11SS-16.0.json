  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11§ 16.0 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis Part implements article 63 of the Insurance Law and establishes methods, procedures and reports for licensing, facilitating, monitoring and verifying compliance with the requirements of the Insurance Law. In effect, article 63 allows special risks that are jumbo in dimensions or exotic in nature to be written, free of filing rates or policy forms with the superintendent, in what is sometimes called the \"Free Trade Zone\". In addition, article 63 allows certain coverage for \"large commercial insureds\" to be written as special risks. Although filing is not required except as specified in section 6303, rates and policy forms applied to special risks must still satisfy governing standards set forth in the Insurance Law and regulations.
