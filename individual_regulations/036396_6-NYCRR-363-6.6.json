  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.6 - Liner system and final cover requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Double composite liner system. Except as\notherwise described in this Part, all landfills regulated under this Part must\nhave a double composite liner system that consists of a primary leachate\ncollection and removal system, a geocushion, a primary composite liner\nconstructed of a geomembrane liner and a GCL, a secondary leachate collection\nand removal system, a geocushion, and a secondary composite liner system\nconstructed of a geomembrane liner and two feet of low permeability soil. The\nlandfill must be designed and constructed to meet or exceed the following liner\nsystem requirements: (1)\n\nOn slopes less than\nor equal to 10 percent, the liner system must consist of a double composite\nliner system which meets the following requirements: (i) the primary composite liner must be\ncomprised of a nominal 80 mil or thicker high density polyethylene (HDPE)\ngeomembrane placed above and in direct and uniform contact with an\nappropriately specified GCL; and\n(ii)\nthe secondary composite liner must be\ncomprised of a nominal 60 mil or thicker HDPE geomembrane placed above and in\ndirect and uniform contact with a minimum two-foot-thick low-permeability soil\nlayer that has a remolded hydraulic conductivity of\n1x10\n-7\ncentimeter per second or\nless. (2)\n\nOn slopes\ngreater than ten percent, the liner system must consist of a double liner\nsystem which meets the following requirements: (i) from the toe of the slope to five\nvertical feet up the side slope, the primary liner must meet the double\ncomposite liner requirements of subparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision. Above\nfive vertical feet up the side slope, the primary liner may be constructed of a\nnominal 80 mil HDPE or thicker geomembrane; and\n(ii)\nthe secondary composite liner must meet\nthe requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nThe\nliner system must include a primary leachate collection and removal system that\nis designed to maintain no more than 12 inches of leachate depth (head) above\nthe primary liner, except during 24-hour, 25-year storm events and except in\nsump areas. The leachate collection and removal system must be designed to\nfunction with proper maintenance throughout the active life, post-closure\nperiod, and custodial care period of the landfill. (i) The primary leachate collection and\nremoval system must be a minimum of two feet thick. (ii)\n\nOn slopes less than or equal to ten\npercent, the 24 inches of primary leachate collection and removal system must\nhave a hydraulic conductivity of 1.0 centimeter per second or greater. Alternatively, the upper 12 inches of primary leachate collection and removal\nsystem may have a hydraulic conductivity of 0.1 centimeter per second or\ngreater if the lower 12 inches has a hydraulic conductivity of 1.0 centimeter\nper second or greater. (iii)\n\nOn\nslopes greater than ten percent, the entire 24inch thickness of the primary\nleachate collection and removal system must have a hydraulic conductivity of\n0.1 centimeter per second or greater. (4)\n\nThe liner system must include a secondary\nleachate collection and removal system placed between the primary and secondary\nliners with a design capacity of at least 1,000 gallons per acre per day and a\nmaximum detection time of 24 hours using steady state flow calculations in a\nsaturated medium. (i) On slopes less than or\nequal to ten percent, the secondary leachate collection and removal system must\ninclude a geosynthetic drainage layer and a minimum of one foot of soil\ndrainage media with a hydraulic conductivity of 0.1 centimeter per second or\ngreater and designed to have a maximum leachate depth (head) of one\ninch. (ii)\n\nOn all slopes greater\nthan ten percent, the secondary leachate collection system may be constructed\nof a geosynthetic drainage layer system designed to meet the hydraulic and\nmechanical needs of the landfill with a head that does not exceed the thickness\nof the confined drainage layer. (b) C&D debris landfills, papermill\nsludge monofills, municipal waste combustor ash monofills, and other industrial\nwaste monofills.Landfills used solely for the disposal of C&D debris, papermill sludge, municipal waste combustor ash, or solid waste resulting from\nindustrial operations other than those described above are subject to the\ndouble composite liner requirements described in subdivision (a) of this\nsection and section\n363-6.7\nof this Subpart, unless the\napplicant demonstrates that an alternative liner system is justified and will\nnot adversely impact groundwater quality. The department may impose additional\nor less stringent requirements on these types of landfills based on the\npollution potential of the waste. An alternative liner system with less\nstringent requirements cannot be used in landfills located in Nassau or Suffolk\n\nCounties. For those landfills where the applicant demonstrates that an\nalternative liner system is justified, the need for a formal variance is\nwaived. (1)\n\nLiner system designs for C&D\ndebris landfills, papermill sludge monofills, municipal waste combustor ash\nmonofills, and industrial waste monofills that do not meet the requirements of\nthis section and section\n363-6.7\nof this Subpart must\ndemonstrate that they will not adversely impact groundwater quality. The\ndemonstration must, at a minimum, address the following factors: (i) climatological conditions in the vicinity\nof the proposed site; (ii)\nhydrogeologic characteristics of the proposed site; (iii)\nanticipated liner system leakage to the\nsubsurface; (iv)\ndevelopment of an\naccurate profile of leachate quality and production rates sufficient to be used\nin evaluating the fate and transport of leachate from the point of release to\nthe first point of environmental monitoring in order to determine whether\nleachate constituents can be expected to exceed the State's groundwater quality\nstandards; (v) justification that\nthe C&D debris, papermill sludge, municipal waste combustor ash or\nindustrial wastes' chemical characterization was accurately defined and that\nthere are no reasons to anticipate significant changes in the concentrations of\ncompounds that could increase the wastes' pollution potential in the\nfuture; (vi)\npresentation of data\nfrom chemical compatibility tests performed on the proposed liner and/or\nleachate collection and removal system materials with representative waste\nleachate, using an appropriate permeameter test to determine potential changes\nin the permeability of the proposed liner; and\n(vii)\nmodeling of contaminant transport to\nevaluate the impacts of the characterized leachate on groundwater quality at\nthe closest environmental monitoring point based upon the liner system's\ncalculated leakage rate and the site's hydrogeologic conditions. (2)\nA new demonstration must be\nperformed in accordance with paragraph 363-6.6(c)(1) of this subdivision\nwhenever the characteristics of the received waste change. (c) Final cover system. Except as otherwise\ndescribed in this Part, all landfills must have at a minimum a final cover\nsystem that consists of a composite barrier layer, barrier protection and\ndrainage layer, and topsoil layer meeting the requirements of sections\n363-6.15\nthrough\n363-6.18\nof this Subpart and\n\nSubpart 363- 9 of this Part. The final cover system must be designed to\npreclude precipitation from entering the landfill and be capable of preventing\nlandfill gas migration to the atmosphere. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
