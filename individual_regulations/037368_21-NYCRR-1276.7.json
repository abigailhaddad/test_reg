  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1276.7 - Methods of discharge or transfer\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pumps. The flammable liquid cargo shall\nbe discharged only by operation of hazardous liquid discharge pumps, driven by\na power take-off device from the truck engine. Evidence of approval of such\ndischarge pumps by a laboratory or testing establishment designated by the\nairport operator shall be submitted. Pumping compartments, if any, shall be\nventilated to avoid accumulation of fumes. Power take-off devices shall include\nmechanical, hydraulic, or electric units. (b) Piping, hose and nozzle. The cargo shall\nbe discharged through a system of rigid piping joined together by welding, screwed fittings, of vitaulic gruv-a-grip flanged connections with O-ring or\nequal gaskets or equal couplings, and if necessary or desirable flexible hose\nconnections. Flexible hose connections, if used, shall be of armored or\nprotected type gasoline hose fitted with standard screwed or flanged pattern\nfittings affixed to the hose by standard internal expanding rings or machine\npressed collars. Cargo lines between the tank and the pump section shall be\ntested with the cargo tank as indicated in section\n1276.6. Cargo lines from the pump\nthrough the discharge hose shall be hydrostatically tested when so required by\nthe airport operator to a pressure 50 pounds above the normal working pressure\nand so certified to the airport operator in writing. The delivery of product\nshall at all times be under the control of the vehicle attendant through the\nuse of approved self-closing nozzles or approved underwing fueling control\ndevices operated by the attendant designed to shut off automatically upon\nrelease of hand or foot pressure-- latching or fastening devices on control\nunits are not permitted. No delivery hose or hoses shall be used except: (1)\n\nStandard hose designed to handle gasoline\nor similar aircraft fuel at the highest pump operating pressures with\nallowances for surge conditions. (2)\n\nStandard make hose and fittings used in\nconnection with overwing or underwing fueling; provided that such hose shall be\nfitted with bronze hose fittings affixed by standard internal expanded rings or\nmachine pressed collars, and self-closing nozzles with a static bonding wire\nand clip or jack securely fastened to insure a good bond. Evidence of approval\nof such hose, fittings and nozzle by a laboratory or testing establishment\ndesignated by the airport operator shall be submitted when required. (3)\n\nHose used for product transfer shall be\ninspected daily and checked for leaks, worn spots, worn gaskets, and fittings. Hose having cuts, nicks, worn or weak spots should be replaced or removed for\nstandard hydrostatic pressure testing. The test pressure should be 150 psig for\naverage usage applied by hand pump on a fully charged, air free hose and\nmaintained for at least five minutes. (c) Plumbing and accessory equipment. All\npiping, fittings and valves and accessory equipment (except those components\nwhich are located inside the product storage tank or tanks upstream of the\nfilter and normally closed, safety shut-off valve under dead-man control shall\nbe of steel, malleable iron, heavy cast iron, bronze or other composition metal\nhaving a melting point in excess of 1600 degrees Fahrenheit. (d) Filters. All filter system and fuel\nstorage vessels containing 30 gallons or more fuel shall be made of steel and\nshall have all openings for product transfer arranged to prevent gravity\ndischarge. All other fuel handling rigid plumbing shall be of metal\nconstruction. (e) Valves and\nconnections. All tank vehicles wherein the discharge piping is connected to the\nbottom of the cargo tank compartments shall be equipped with an automatic\nshut-off valve located inside the shell of the tank in each compartment outlet. On tank vehicles with discharge piping or pump suction piping connected from\nthe top of the cargo tank, there shall be arranged in the suction portion of\npiping, between every compartment and each pump, an automatic valve or valves\ndesigned to close off the flow of product. Except during tank filling or fuel\ndelivery operations, such valves shall be kept closed. The operating mechanisms\nfor discharge valves shall be provided with two secondary manual \"emergency\"\ncontrols located on opposite sides and ends of the tank vehicle separate from\nthe regular discharge valve operating mechanism, and such control mechanism\nshall also be provided with fusible elements, sections or links at each\ndischarge valve arranged to cause the valves to close automatically in the\nevent of fire. The fusible elements shall operate at a temperature not\nexceeding 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The release mechanism for internal or\ndischarge valves under manual and/or fusible control shall be arranged to\neffect closing of such valves and stop product discharge in not more than 10\nseconds operating time. (f) Propulsion and pumping engine. The propulsion and pumping engine shall be\narranged with safeguards to reduce ignition sources to a minimum and shall\ninclude: (1)\n\nThe carburetor shall be fitted\nwith an approved back flash arrestor (baffled and screened air cleaner\nacceptable). (2)\n\nAll wiring shall\nbe adequately insulated, fastened to eliminate chafing and affixed to terminal\nconnections by tight fitting snap or screw connections with rubber or similar\ninsulating and shielding covers, boots or sleeves. (3)\n\nGlass or plastic bowls or compartments\nfor carburetors, fuel pumps or filters shall not be used unless the failure of\nsuch devices discontinues fuel supply to the engine and will not permit gravity\ndischarge of fuel from the engine fuel supply tank. (4)\n\nStarting motors and generators should be\nmounted at least two feet above the ground level or be of fully enclosed\npattern preventing any fuel spill vapors from being drawn into the starter or\ngenerator through ventilating openings. (g) Markings of emergency control. The\nemergency operating devices shall be conspicuously marked with two inch letters\non contrasting background reading \"EMERGENCY SHUT OFF\" with other appropriate\noperating instructions as required such as push-pull-operating arrows, etc. (h) Piping, equipment, hose and\nnozzles. Section\n1276.6, relating to composition of\nplumbing and accessory equipment, shall be complied with. The refueling vehicle\nshall have a system of rigid piping joined together by welding, screwed\nfittings, or vitaulic gruv-a-grip or equal couplings, and if necessary or\ndesirable, flexible hose connections. Flexible hose connections, if used, shall\nbe of armored or protected type for gasoline, fitted with standard screwed or\nflanged pattern fittings affixed to the hose by standard internal expanding\nrings or machine pressed collars. All cargo lines and hose shall be\nhydrostatically tested when so required by the airport operator to a pressure\n50 pounds above the normal working pressure and so certified to the airport\noperator in writing. No delivery hose or hoses shall be used except: Standard\nhose designed to handle gasoline or similar overwing refueling; provided that\nsuch hose shall be fitted with bronze hose fittings affixed by standard\ninternal expanded rings or machine pressed collars, and self-closing nozzles\nwith a static bonding wire and clip or jack securely fastened to insure a good\nbond. Evidence of approval of such hose, fittings and nozzle by a laboratory or\ntesting establishment designated by the airport operator shall be submitted\nwhen required. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n1276.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
