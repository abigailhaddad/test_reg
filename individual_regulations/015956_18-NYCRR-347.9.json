  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 347.9 - Enforcement of support obligations and issuance of income withholding orders\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Immediate\nissuance of income execution for support enforcement (income withholding\norder). For any child support or combined child and spousal\nsupport court order issued under the provisions of section\n236\nor\n240\nof\nthe Domestic Relations Law, or article 4, 5, 5-A or 5-B of the Family Court\n\nAct, which directs payments to the Support Collection Unit (SCU), the local\nchild support enforcement unit through its SCU, must: (1)\nimmediately issue and process an income\nwithholding order within 15 calendar days of the date the support order is\nreceived if the employer's or income payor's address is known or, if unknown, within two business days of the date the automated case record receives notice\nof the income source from the State New Hire Directory or other source, unless: (i) the court finds and sets forth in writing\nthe reasons that there is good cause not to require immediate income\nwithholding. For purposes of this paragraph, good cause\nmeans\nsubstantial harm to the debtor. The absence of an arrearage or the mere\nissuance of an income withholding order does not constitute good cause; or\n(ii)\nwhen the child is not in\nreceipt of public assistance, a written agreement providing for an alternative\narrangement has been executed by the parties. A written agreement may include\nan oral stipulation made on the record in court which results in a written\norder: (2)\nissue and\nprocess an income withholding order as follows: (i) use the form for income withholding\npromulgated by the office; (ii)\nserve the income withholding order upon the debtor's employer or income payor, and provide a copy of the income withholding order to the debtor. Service must\nbe by regular mail or in the same manner as a summons may be served; the\ndebtor's copy may be mailed to the debtor's last known residence or such other\nplace where the debtor is likely to receive notice; (iii)\ncorrect any error made in the issuance\nof an income withholding order which is to the detriment of the debtor, within\n30 days after notification by the debtor of such error; and\n(iv)\nto the extent not already included on\nthe form provided by the office, include the following information in a\nseparate document served with the income withholding order: (a) the court in which the order of support\nwas entered; (b) the amount of the\nperiodic payments directed; (c) the\ntotal amount of any arrears; (d) the names of the debtor and creditor; (e) the name and address of the employer or\nincome payor from whom the debtor is receiving or will receive\nincome; (f) the amount of the\ndeduction to be made from the debtor's income to satisfy the court-ordered\ncurrent support obligation; (g) the\namount, determined in accordance with subdivision (e) of this section, of any\nadditional deduction to be made from the debtor's income, to be applied to the\nreduction of support arrears/past due support; (h) a statement providing notice of the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe deductions will apply to\ncurrent and future income; (2)\nthe\nincome withholding order will be served upon any current or subsequent employer\nor income payor; (3)\nthe income\nwithholding order is binding until further notice; and\n(4)\nthe procedures available for claiming\nthat the support collection unit made an error in issuing the income\nwithholding order; (5)\nno employer\nis permitted to discharge, lay off or discipline an employee or refuse to hire\na prospective employee because one or more wage assignments or income\nwithholding orders have been served upon such employer or a former employer\nagainst the employee's or prospective employee's wages, and that a violation of\nthis provision is punishable as a contempt of court by fine or imprisonment or\nboth; (6)\neach payment remitted by\nan employer or income payor must be payable to the State disbursement unit and\nmust include the information as instructed in the income withholding\norder; (7)\nan employer or income\npayor served with an income withholding order is required to commence\ndeductions from income due or thereafter due to the debtor no later than the\nfirst pay period that occurs 14 days after service of the income withholding\norder, and is required to remit payments to the State disbursement unit within\nseven business days of the date that the debtor is paid; (8)\nan employer or income payor is liable to\nthe creditor for failure to deduct the amounts specified; provided, however, that deduction of the amounts specified by the employer or income payor does\nnot relieve the debtor of the underlying obligation of support; (9)\nif the employer or income payor fails to\nremit payments as provided in the income withholding order, the creditor or the\ndebtor may commence a proceeding against such person for accrued deductions, together with interest and reasonable attorney's fees; (10)\nif the money due to the debtor consists\nof salary or wages and the debtor's employment is terminated by resignation or\ndismissal at any time after service of the income withholding order, the levy\nwill thereafter be ineffective and the income withholding order will be\nreturned, unless the debtor is reinstated or reemployed within 90 days after\nsuch termination; (11)\nan employer\nor income payor must notify the State disbursement unit promptly when the\ndebtor terminates employment or no longer receives income, and must provide the\ndebtor's last address and the name and address of the new employer, if\nknown; (12)\nwhere the income is\ncompensation paid or payable to the debtor for personal services, the amount of\nthe deductions to be withheld are not permitted to exceed 50 percent of the\nearnings of the debtor remaining after the deduction therefrom of any amounts\nrequired by law to be withheld (hereinafter referred to as disposable\nearnings), except that if any part of such deduction is to be applied to the\nreduction of arrears which have accrued more than 12 weeks prior to the\nbeginning of the week for which such earnings are payable, the amount of such\ndeduction cannot exceed 55 percent of disposable earnings; (13)\nupon a finding by the family court that\nthe employer or income payor failed to deduct or remit deductions as specified\nin the income withholding order, the court shall issue to the employer or\nincome payor an order directing compliance and may direct the payment to the\ncreditor of a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for the first instance and\n$1,000 per instance for the second and subsequent instances of employer or\nincome payor noncompliance; and\n(14)\nwhen an employer or income payor\nreceives an income withholding order issued by another state, the employer or\nincome payor shall apply the income withholding law of the state of the\ndebtor's principal place of employment in determining: (i) the employer's fee, if any, for\nprocessing income withholding; (ii)\nthe maximum amount permitted to be withheld from the debtor's income; (iii)\nthe time periods within which the\nemployer must implement the income withholding and forward the child support\npayments to the other state; (iv)\nthe priorities for withholding and allocating income withheld for multiple\nchild support creditors; and\n(v) any withholding terms or conditions not specified in the withholding\ninstrument. (b) Issuance of income withholding\norder upon default. For any child support or combined child and spousal\nsupport court order issued prior to November 1, 1990, the local child support\nenforcement unit, through its support collection unit (SCU), must maintain an\neffective system for identifying those debtors who become delinquent in meeting\ntheir court-ordered support obligation(s). The following action must be taken\nagainst those respondents who have been identified as being delinquent: (1)\n\nFor those debtors who have failed to pay\nup to two required weekly court-ordered support payments or one biweekly\ncourt-ordered support payment, districts should attempt to obtain voluntary\nresumption of support payments. (2)\n\nFor those debtors who have failed to remit three payments when due in the full\namount directed by an order of support, or if the accumulation of arrears is\nequal to or greater than the amount directed to be paid for one month, local\ndistrict SCUs must issue and process an income withholding order as follows: (i) Use the form for income withholding\npromulgated by the office. (ii)\n\nServe a copy of the income withholding order upon the debtor, by regular mail\nor in the same manner as a summons may be served, at the debtor's last known\nresidence or such other place where the debtor is likely to receive\nnotice. (iii)\n\nIf a mistake of fact\nis alleged by the debtor, determine the validity of such claim and provide\nwritten notice of such determination within 45 days after notice to the debtor\nof the intent to serve the income withholding order on the employer or income\npayor. If the mistake of fact is disallowed, the written notice must state that\nthe income withholding order will be served on the employer or income payor, and the time that deductions will begin. (iv)\n\nIf no mistake of fact is alleged by the\ndebtor, or if a determination is made by the SCU that the alleged mistake of\nfact is not valid, proceed with the expeditious implementation of the income\nwithholding order by serving the income withholding order upon the debtor's\nemployer or income payor. (v) To\nthe extent not already included on the form for income withholding, the\nfollowing information must be provided in a separate document served with the\nincome withholding order: (a) the court in\nwhich the order of support was entered; (b) the amount of the periodic payments\nspecified in the order of support; (c) the total amount of any\narrears; (d) the names of the\ndebtor and creditor; (e) the name\nand address of the employer or income payor from whom the debtor is receiving\nor will receive income; (f) the\namount of the deduction to be made from the debtor's income to satisfy the\ncurrent court-ordered support obligation; (g) the amount, determined in accordance with\nsubdivision (e) of this section, of any additional deduction to be made from\nthe debtor's income to be applied to the reduction of support arrears/past due\nsupport; (h) a statement of the\nmanner in which a mistake of fact may be asserted; (i) a statement providing notice of the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe deductions will apply to\ncurrent and future income; (2)\nthe\nincome withholding order will be served upon any current or subsequent employer\nor income payor, unless a mistake of fact is asserted within 15 days; (3)\nif the debtor claims a mistake of fact, a\ndetermination of the validity of such claim will be made within 45 days after\nnotice to the debtor is provided and the debtor will receive written notice of: (i) whether or not the income withholding\norder will be served; and\n(ii)\nthe\ndate when deductions will begin; and\n(4)\nthe income withholding order is binding\nuntil further notice; and\n(j) the statements set forth in clause\n(a)(2)(iv)(\nh\n)(\n5\n)-(\n14\n) of\nthis section. (3)\n\nWith regard to debtors who have defaulted\non their court-ordered support obligations and who are unemployed, social\nservices districts should proceed as follows: (i) if the amount in default is not\nsufficient for the implementation of an income withholding order, an attempt\nshould be made to obtain a written voluntary agreement to support, whereby the\n\nDepartment of Labor would be authorized to withhold the amount agreed upon from\nthe debtor's unemployment insurance benefits and remit such amount to the State\ndisbursement unit; or\n(ii)\nif the\namount in default is sufficient for the implementation of an income withholding\norder, action should be taken as set forth in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (c) In cases in which attempts to enforce a\nsupport order have been unsuccessful, the child support enforcement unit, at\nthe time such attempts fail, must examine the reasons for the failure and\ndetermine when, in the future, it would be appropriate to take enforcement\nactions and, at that time, take such actions. (d) Additional enforcement\naction. The child support enforcement unit, in addition to\nfollowing the procedures set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, must employ all appropriate statutory support enforcement remedies, within 30\ncalendar days of identifying a failure to comply with the support provisions of\nthe order, or of locating the absent parent, whichever occurs later. Every\npetition to find the noncustodial parent in violation or motion to hold a\nnoncustodial parent in contempt of an order to pay child support shall provide\nclear notice to the noncustodial parent that his or her inability to pay child\nsupport as ordered by the court is a defense to a finding of willful violation\nor contempt. If service of process is necessary prior to initiating an\nenforcement action, such service must be completed and enforcement action taken\nor the child support enforcement unit must document in the automated case\nrecord unsuccessful diligent efforts to serve process, as defined in section\n347.7\nof this Part, no later than\n60 calendar days after identifying a failure to comply with the support\nprovisions of the order or of locating the absent parent, whichever occurs\nlater. (e) Calculation\nof the amount of additional deduction for income withholding. (1)\n\nWhen an income withholding order is\nissued under subdivision (a) or (b) of this section for a debtor who owes\nsupport arrears/past due support, the SCU must set the amount of the additional\ndeduction to be made from the debtor's income. Such deduction must be in\naddition to the amount withheld to ensure compliance with the support\nobligation directed in the order of support. The amount of the additional\ndeduction must be set as follows: (i) If the\nincome from which deductions are to be made represents wage, salary, commission, draws on commissions, pension, or retirement income, or other\nperiodic payments, including but not limited to workers' compensation, disability, social security, or unemployment insurance benefits income, the\namount of the additional deduction shall be one-half (50 percent) of the amount\nof the current support obligations, at the same frequency as the current\nsupport obligation. Where a current support obligation no longer exists the\nadditional amount shall be one and one-half (150 percent) of the amount of the\nmost recent current support obligation greater than zero, at the same frequency\nas the most recent support obligation. Where no current support obligation ever\nexisted for current support but support arrears were established by the court, the additional amount shall be the amount of arrears divided by 12, payable in\nmonthly installments. (ii)\n\nIf the\nincome is from a source not identified in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph\nincluding, but not limited to, lump sum payments of bonuses, interest, dividends, workers' compensation, disability, social security, or unemployment\ninsurance benefits income, the amount of the additional deduction shall be the\ntotal amount of support arrears/past due support. Provided, however, that two\nor more periodic payments of workers' compensation, disability, social\nsecurity, or unemployment insurance benefits income disbursed to a debtor as a\nsingle payment shall not be considered a lump sum payment, but shall be treated\nas separate periodic payments, each subject to deduction pursuant to\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nWhere the debtor provides documentary\nproof to the SCU that the imposition of the additional amount would reduce the\ndebtor's remaining income below the self-support reserve, the SCU must\neliminate or reduce the amount of the additional deduction as appropriate to\nensure that the debtor's remaining income does not fall below the self-support\nreserve. Thereafter, the SCU must increase the amount of the additional\ndeduction to the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision at such time as its application would no longer reduce the debtor's\nremaining income below the self-support reserve. (3)\n\nWhere the debtor provides documentary\nproof to the SCU that the debtor has physical custody of the children who are\nthe subjects of the support order, and a current support obligation no longer\nexists, the SCU may modify the amount of the additional deduction after taking\ninto account the debtor's income and ability to support such\nchildren. (4)\n\nThe amount of the\nadditional deduction for an income withholding order must be eliminated by the\nSCU upon satisfaction of the support arrears/past due support. (5)\n\nThe SCU must maintain on the automated\ncase record a record of any action to eliminate or modify the amount of the\nadditional deduction. (f) Issuance of income withholding\norders upon request. Upon request of the debtor, the SCU must issue an income\nwithholding order pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section. Upon receipt of\na written revocation of the debtor's request for an income withholding order, the SCU must notify the employer or income payor that the income withholding\norder is no longer effective.
