  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4620.6 - Big Six\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Equipment. A\nwheel of variable size. Around the rim of the wheel's surface are sections, each of which shows one side of three dice bearing different combinations of\nthe numbers 1 through 6. The wheel has a corresponding layout. (b) The play. (1)\nA player places a wager on one or more\nnumbers on the layout and the dealer spins the wheel. When the wheel stops, the\nsection in which the indicator arm rests is the winning combination. (2)\n\nIf the player places a wager on the\nnumber 1 and the wheel stops at 1-2-3, the payoff odds are 1-to-1 since the\nnumber 1 showed only once. If the wheel stops at 1-1-2, the payoff odds are\n2-to-1 since the number 1 showed twice. This holds true for all the numbers; e.g., if the player places his wager on number 5 and the wheel stops on 4-5-6, the payoff odds are 1-to-1. If the wheel stops at 5-5-5, the payoff odds are\n3-to-1. (3)\n\nThe maximum bet shall\nbe $5 or its equivalent in chips. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4620.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
