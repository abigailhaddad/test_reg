  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 645.2 - Imposition of taxes upon recording of a supplemental mortgage\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 255, Administrative Code of the City of New\n\nYork, § 11-2601(f)\n(a) The recording of\na supplemental mortgage is subject to the applicable mortgage recording taxes\nas described in Part 642 of this Title to the extent that such mortgage creates\nor secures a new or further indebtedness or obligation other than the principal\nindebtedness or obligation secured or which under any contingency may be\nsecured by the prior recorded primary mortgage(s). (See Part 647 of this Title\nfor the special treatment of credit line mortgages on certain residential\nproperty). (b) For purposes of this\nsubdivision, the principal indebtedness or obligation secured by or which under\nany contingency may be secured by the prior recorded primary mortgage is equal\nto the remaining principal indebtedness secured or which under any contingency\nmay be secured by such mortgage at the time that the supplemental mortgage is\nexecuted or at any time thereafter. Example 1: On January 1, 1990, Mr. Jones gives XYZ Bank a mortgage\nsecuring a principal debt of $100,000 and the proper mortgage recording taxes\nare paid. On January 1, 1991, at a time when the remaining principal\nindebtedness secured by such prior recorded mortgage totals $90,000, Mr. Jones\ngives XYZ Bank another mortgage which secures an additional $30,000. When the\nmortgage was presented for recording the proper taxes computed upon the $30,000\namount were paid. Simultaneously, Mr. Jones and the bank enter into an\nagreement which by its terms and conditions consolidates the liens of the two\nmortgages into one lien securing a total principal debt of $120,000. The\nconsolidation agreement makes proper reference to the prior recorded mortgages. Therefore, the consolidation agreement constitutes a supplemental mortgage\nwhich may be recorded tax free since it does not secure any new or further\nindebtedness other than that secured by the prior recorded primary\nmortgages. If the new $30,000 mortgage had by its terms consolidated\nthe liens of the two mortgages into one lien securing a total principal debt of\n$120,000, the new mortgage itself would have constituted a supplemental\nmortgage. The applicable mortgage recording taxes would apply to its recording\nand taxes would be imposed and computed based upon the $30,000 of new or\nfurther indebtedness secured by such mortgage. (c) Notwithstanding any provision to the\ncontrary in subdivisions (a), (d), (e) and (f) of this section, where a\nsupplemental mortgage is recorded for one of the purposes set forth in section\n645.1\n(a)(3)\nof this Part and the additional real property covered by the supplemental\nmortgage is situated in a county where the additional tax is currently imposed\nand the prior recorded primary mortgage is situated in a county where the\nadditional tax is currently imposed and the prior recorded primary mortgage was\non real property situated in a county that has suspended the additional tax, and such tax was not paid, such additional tax, as described in section\n642.2\nof this Title is imposed and computed based on the principal indebtedness or\nobligation secured by or which under any contingency may be secured by such\nsupplemental mortgage on the date it is executed or at any time thereafter. Example 2: Mr. Smith gives Z Bank a mortgage on real property located\nin Schoharie County, which is a county that has suspended the imposition of the\nadditional tax. The mortgage secures a principal debt of $50,000. The mortgage\nis recorded and the proper mortgage recording taxes are paid. Subsequent to the\nrecording of such mortgage, Mr. Smith gives Z Bank a mortgage on real property\nlocated in Albany County, as additional security for the payment of the same\n$50,000 debt. Albany County imposes the additional tax. The additional tax is imposed and computed upon the $50,000\ndebt secured by the supplemental mortgage. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision to\nthe contrary in subdivisions (a), (c), (e) and (f) of this section, where a\nsupplemental mortgage is recorded for one of the purposes set forth in section\n645.1\n(a)(3)\nof this Part, and the additional real property covered by the supplemental\nmortgage is situated within the City of New York, and the recorded primary\nmortgage was on real property situated outside such city and the City of New\n\nYork tax as described in section\n642.4\nof this Title was not paid when the prior recorded primary mortgage was\nrecorded, such mortgage recording tax is imposed and computed based on the\nprincipal indebtedness or obligation secured by or which under any contingency\nmay be secured by such supplemental mortgage. Example 3: Same facts as in Example 2 except that the real property\nwhich is encumbered by the lien of the supplemental mortgage given as\nadditional security is located in New York City, where both the additional tax\nand the City of New York tax are imposed, and the remaining principal debt\nsecured or to be secured by the first mortgage at the time the supplemental\nmortgage is executed mortgage is $45,000. The additional tax and the City of New York tax are imposed\nupon the recording of the supplemental mortgage and computed upon the $45,000\ndebt secured by such supplemental mortgage. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision to\nthe contrary in subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) of this section, where a\nsupplemental mortgage is recorded for one of the purposes set forth in section\n645.1\n(a)(3)\nof this part, and the additional real property covered by the supplemental\nmortgage is situated within the City of Yonkers, and the prior recorded primary\nmortgage was on real property situated outside such city and the City of\n\nYonkers tax described in section\n642.5\nof this Title was not paid when the prior recorded primary mortgage was\nrecorded, such mortgage recording tax is imposed and computed based on the\nprincipal indebtedness or obligation secured by or which under any contingency\nmay be secured by such supplemental mortgage at the date of execution of such\nsupplemental mortgage or at any time thereafter. (f) Notwithstanding any other provision to\nthe contrary in subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section, where a\nsupplemental mortgage is recorded for one of the purposes set forth in section\n645.1\n(a)(3)\nof this part, and the additional real property covered by the supplemental\nmortgage is situated within Broome County, and the prior recorded primary\nmortgage was on real property situated outside such county and the Broome\n\nCounty tax described in section\n642.6\nof this Title was not paid when the prior recorded primary mortgage was\nrecorded, such mortgage recording tax is imposed and computed based on the\nprincipal indebtedness or obligation secured by or which under any contingency\nmay be secured by such supplemental mortgage at the date of execution of such\nsupplemental mortgage or at any time thereafter.
