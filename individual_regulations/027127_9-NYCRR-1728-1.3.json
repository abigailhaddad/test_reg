  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1728-1.3 - Computation of budget items\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nHousing companies\nare required to prepare budgets in accordance with schedules and accounting\ncategories, and in formats, as specified by the division. In addition, to\nprovide for the uniform calculation of certain items in companies' budgets, the\ndivision establishes standards and formulas for their computation and/or\nprojection. (2)\n\nThe computation of\ncertain major items of income and obligations is fixed by other means. Calculation of required debt service and debt service arrears is based on the\ndebt service schedule(s) established pursuant to the terms of the mortgage(s). Other expense items, such as real estate taxes and water and sewer charges, are\nbased on established rates and projections available from the municipality or\nother appropriate governmental entity. (3)\n\nThere are three basic categories of\nhousing company income: rental income, subsidy income, and other income. (i) Rental income\nconsists\nof: (a) the scheduled rents for all\nresidential apartments; (b) the\nscheduled rents based upon leases for commercial space and professional\napartments; and\n(c) the scheduled\nrents based upon a lease of the net number of rented parking spaces. (ii)\n\nSubsidy\nincome\nconsists of subsidy payments paid to or on behalf of the\nhousing company by the Federal, State or local government. (iii)\n\nOther income\nconsists\nof: (a) charges for tenants' or cooperators'\nuse of air conditioners and appliances; and\n(b) surcharge income, interest income and\nmiscellaneous income, which are projected based upon the prior year's\nexperience unless, upon assessment by the division of changed conditions, an\nadjustment to such rate or amount is found to be warranted. (b) Maintenance and operating expenses. Projections for each category of expense shall be made\nby applying adjustments for inflation to current expenditures, as revised\npursuant to section\n1728-1.2\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. The inflation adjustment factors, which shall be applied to each\napplicable individual category of expense, are derived from the United States\n\nDepartment of Labor Statistics New York-Northern New Jersey Consumer Price\n\nIndex for all Urban Consumers, unless otherwise specified in this section or as\ndetermined by a supply or service contract, for the period of said\ncontract. (c) Fuel\noil. Projected costs of fuel oil will be calculated and\nrevised monthly by the division based on an analysis of oil prices and/or oil\nprice futures. (d) Electricity, gas and steam. Costs for these utilities shall be based on actual\ncurrent expenses, adjusted by amounts to cover any rate adjustments which have\nbeen granted or are reasonably expected to be granted by the New York State\n\nPublic Service Commission. (e) Contingency reserve. Payments into the contingency reserve shall be computed\naccording to the following schedule: Current balance as percentage of\nannual residential rent roll\n\nAnnual addition to\nreserve\n\nLess than 10 percent\n3 percent of annual rents\n10 percent up to 15 percent\n21/2 percent of annual rents\n15 percent up to 20 percent\n2 percent of annual rents\n20 percent up to 25 percent\n1 percent of annual rents\n25 percent or more\n\nNo additional payments\n\nIf a company has no vacancies for the last two years\nand currently has a waiting list for all size apartments, the above\nrequirements will be reduced by one half of one percent in each category. Funding of the contingency reserve shall not be required if there are debt\nservice arrears. (f) Replacement reserve. (1)\n\nCurrent. Funding of the replacement reserve shall be based upon the division's\nanalysis of a study of the housing company which shall be conducted by a\nqualified technical consultant. The requirements for the study will include a\ndetailed physical examination of the housing company and preparation of a\nschedule of anticipated replacement needs and their cost. Pending the\ndivision's analysis of the funding requirements for each housing company, housing companies will be required to fund replacement reserves at the greater\nof: (i) the current required annual\ncontribution; or\n(ii)\n0.006 of the\nproject's original construction cost. (2)\n\nArrears. For purposes of computing the\nannual funding requirement for arrears in the replacement reserve: (i) the required balance shall be the total\nof the amounts required by the division to be deposited in the replacement\nreserve fund from the inception of the project, plus all interest earnings\ncredited to the replacement reserve fund; less the sum of the total amount\nauthorized by the division as allowable charges against the replacement reserve\nfund, and the amount determined as the projected cost of essential corrective\nwork which has been identified and which is eligible for funding in accordance\nwith existing replacement schedules and guidelines. The division will provide\nan encumbrance form detailing the nature and estimated cost of the\nwork; (ii)\nthe current available\nbalance shall be the amount in the replacement reserve fund of the company, less the cost of the corrective work as identified in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph; (iii)\nthe arrears shall\nbe the difference between the amount computed in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph and the amount computed in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. (3)\n\nThe\nannual funding requirement for arrears in the replacement reserve shall be no\nless than the amount computed from the following schedule: Arrears as percentage of required\nbalance\n\nRepayment\nperiod\n25 percent up to 50 percent\n6 years\n50 percent up to 75 percent\n5 years\n75 percent or more\n4 years\n(4)\n\nNotwithstanding the preceding provisions\nof this subdivision, the annual requirement for replacement reserve arrears\nshall not exceed the provision for the current replacement reserve requirement\nused in the operating budget projection, unless the division shall otherwise\ndetermine. (g) Working capital. (1)\n\nWorking capital\nis defined as the sum of: (i) operating cash (administration fund and\nmanaging agent's cash account); and\n(ii)\ninvestments made from these funds; less\nthe sum of current accounts payable (exclusive of debt service). (2)\nA budget provision to fund a\nworking capital deficiency or, alternatively, a provision to apply a working\ncapital surplus to partially offset a projected budget deficit is permitted\nsubject to the following restrictions: (i) A\nworking capital deficit greater than one half of one month's rent, computed\npursuant to the above definition, is to be funded in the first year of the\nbudget, dependent on the extent of the deficit, such that: (a) where the deficit exceeds one month's\nrental income, the budget provision will be for the amount in excess of one\nmonth's rental income, but not less than one half of one month's rental income; or\n(b) if the deficit exceeds one\nhalf of one month's rental income but does not exceed one month's rental\nincome, the provision will be for the amount in excess of one half of one\nmonth's rental income. (3)\n\nThe amount of a working capital surplus\nwhich exceeds one month's rental income may be applied in reduction of a budget\ndeficit to the extent that such amount applied may not exceed 25 percent of the\ndeficit, or three percent of the annual rent roll, whichever is\ngreater. (h) Debt\nservice arrears. Debt service arrears shall be funded in the budget\nprojections at the lesser of: the total debt service arrears or an amount equal\nto the current debt service requirement, unless otherwise provided in an\nagreement restructuring the mortgage loan and approved by the\ndivision. (i) Air\nconditioner and appliance charges. The division shall periodically establish guidelines\nfor charges for the use of various classes of appliances based upon rate and\nconsumption data. (j) Return on equity. (1)\n\nCurrent. Within reasonable limits an annual amount for return on equity shall be\nprovided for in the budget at the rate stated in the share certificates and/or\nincome debentures. In the case of partnerships, the rate shall be as set forth\nin the schedule of estimated annual expenses and income (schedule B) used at\nthe time the initial rents for the housing development were set and included in\nthe mortgage closing documents. (2)\n\nArrears. The amount of arrears provided for in the budget shall not exceed the\namount calculated for the current annual provision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
