  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 143.8 - Billing disputes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every\nelectric corporation shall establish procedures whereby any complaint filed\nwith such corporation by any customer thereof in regard to any bill for service\nrendered or any deposit required will be promptly investigated in an\nappropriate and fair manner, with the result of such investigation being\npromptly reported to the complaining customer. Such procedures shall allow the\nacceptance and processing of complaints submitted in simple manner and form. Regardless of whether a notice of discontinuance has previously been sent, the\nutility's procedures shall provide that pending the utility's investigation it\nshall not discontinue service or issue a notice of discontinuance; provided, however, the consumer may be required to pay the undisputed portion of a\ndisputed bill or deposit to prevent discontinuance or the issuance of a notice\nof discontinuance. (b) If, after\nthe completion of such an investigation, the utility determines that the\ndisputed service has been rendered, or that the disputed charge or deposit is\nproper, in whole or in part, the utility may require the full bill or deposit\nor the appropriate portion thereof to be paid; in such event, appropriate\nnotice of the determination shall be given to the customer, and where notice of\ndiscontinuance of service has previously been sent, or is served with the\ndetermination, such notice shall include a statement advising the customer of\nthe availability of the commission's complaint handling procedures. The\nutility's procedures may provide for discontinuance of service if the customer\nfails to pay such required amount after receipt of proper notice, provided that\na customer's service will not be discontinued until at least five days after\nnotice of the utility's determination, where personal service is made upon the\nperson supplied, or at least eight days after mailing of such a notice; and\nprovided further that no discontinuance may occur if so precluded by the\ncommission pursuant to section\n11.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. (c) The utility's procedures\nshall provide that, where the complaint procedures of the commission have been\ninvoked and it is determined that the disputed service has been rendered, or\nthat the disputed charge or deposit is proper, in whole or in part, a\ncustomer's service will not be discontinued for failure to pay the amount found\nappropriate until at least 15 days after notice of the commission's\ndetermination. (d) The procedures\nrequired to be established under this section shall be filed with the\ncommission for review. The commission shall be advised of any substantial\nchanges in such procedures 30 days prior to their proposed implementation to\npermit commission review. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
