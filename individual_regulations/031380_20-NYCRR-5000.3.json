  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 5000.3 - Procedure with respect to offers in compromise\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Form of offers. An offer in compromise\nshall be filed on the forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance. The forms are available from the department or on the department's\nwebsite. The compromise offer must be in addition to the total amounts\npreviously paid, or collected, against the liability being compromised, if any. If the final payment on an accepted offer is contingent upon the immediate or\nsimultaneous release of a tax lien in whole or in part, such payment must be\nremitted by means, acceptable to the Department of Taxation and Finance, that\nassures unconditional and final payment, such as certified check, bank check or\npostal money order. (b) Stay of\nproceedings. The filing of an offer in compromise shall not constitute the\nfiling of a request for a conciliation conference or the filing of a petition\nfor a hearing. The filing of an offer in compromise shall not (1) automatically\noperate to stay the collection of any tax liability, (2) constitute cause for\npostponement of a conciliation conference (see Part 4000 of this Title) or a\nhearing in the Division of Tax Appeals (see Part 3000 of this Title), or (3)\nsuspend the running of the period of limitations for filing a request for a\nconciliation conference (see Part 4000) or a hearing (see Part 3000). However, enforcement of collection may be deferred if the interests of the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance shall not be jeopardized thereby. (c) Acceptance. An offer in compromise shall\nbe considered accepted only when the taxpayer making the offer is so notified\nin writing. As a condition to accepting an offer in compromise, the taxpayer\nmay be required to enter into any collateral agreement or to post any security\nwhich is deemed necessary for the protection of the interests of the Department\nof Taxation and Finance. Further, as a condition for acceptance of an offer in\ncompromise, the taxpayer must agree that the Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay proceed with any appropriate collection procedures set forth in the Tax Law\nas if the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance had acquired an assessment no\nlonger subject to administrative or judicial review. The commissioner or such\nperson as may be designated by the commissioner may also impose any other\nconditions, qualifications or limitations for acceptance of an offer that he or\nshe may deem appropriate for a particular case. (d) Withdrawal or rejection. An offer in\ncompromise may be withdrawn by the taxpayer making the offer at any time prior\nto its acceptance. In the event an offer is rejected, the taxpayer making the\noffer shall be promptly notified in writing. Frivolous offers or offers filed\nfor the purpose of delaying the collection of liabilities shall be immediately\nrejected. (e) Requirement with\nrespect to statute of limitations. No offer in compromise shall be accepted\nunless the taxpayer waives the running of the statutory period of limitations\non collection of the tax liability involved in the period during which the\noffer is pending, or the period during which any installment remains unpaid, and for one year thereafter. (f) Limitation on number of offers. Generally, a taxpayer may only make one offer\nin compromise under section 171, subdivision eighteeenth-a regarding a\nparticular liability for a particular taxable period. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
