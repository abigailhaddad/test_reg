Tit. 12 § 300.22 - Procedure by carrier, special fund, or TPA following disability event when compensation controverted and when no controversy, including temporary payments of compensation without prejudice\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. The following terms shall have the following meanings when\nused herein: (1)\n\nDisability\nevent\nmeans any accident, including death resulting therefrom, occurring in the course of employment or any alleged accident, including death\nresulting therefrom, that results in personal injury which has caused or will\ncause a loss of time from regular duties of one day beyond the working day or\nshift on which the accident or alleged accident occurred, or which has required\nor will require medical treatment beyond ordinary first aid or more than two\ntreatments by a person rendering first aid; or any disease or alleged disease, including death resulting therefrom, claimed to have been caused by the nature\nof the employment and contracted therein. (2)\n\nElectronic trading partner\nagreement\nmeans the agreement between the carrier, special fund or\nTPA, and the board that establishes the method and frequency of sending and\nreceiving electronic reports including those required by this\nsection. (3)\n\nFiled\nelectronically\nmeans that the electronic transmission submitted by the\ncarrier, special fund, or TPA has been accepted and acknowledged by the board. For the purpose of determining whether an electronic transmission has been\ntimely submitted, any electronic transmission that is submitted to and accepted\nby the board within the time required by subdivisions (b), (c), (d) and (f) of\nthis section shall be considered timely submitted when such electronic\ntransmission is later acknowledged by the board even though the acknowledgement\nby the board may have occurred after the time required by subdivisions (b), (c), (d) and (f) of this section. (4)\n\nSpecial fund\nmeans any\nspecial fund maintained by the board or any administrator of such special fund\nthat is responsible for paying compensation or medical treatment and care of\ninjured workers, including but not limited to, the Special Fund for Reopened\n\nCases created and governed by Workers' Compensation Law section 25-a and the\n\nUninsured Employers' Fund created and governed by Workers' Compensation Law\nsection 26-a. The chair may waive a special fund's obligations under this\nsection. (5)\n\nThird party\nadministrator or TPA\nmeans third party administrators responsible for\nall or part of the claims handling, pursuant to a contract, for the claims of\nthe State Insurance Fund, stock corporations, mutual corporations or reciprocal\ninsurers with which employers are insured to provide workers' compensation\ncoverage, employers permitted to pay compensation directly under the provisions\nof Workers' Compensation Law section 50(3), (3-a) or (4), and any special fund\nmaintained by the board that is responsible for paying for compensation\nbenefits or medical treatment and care of injured workers. (b) Mandatory first reports of injury\nand reports required by section\n110\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. (1)\n\nMandatory first reports of injury. On or before the 18th day after the\ndisability event or within 10 days after the employer has knowledge of the\ndisability event, whichever period is the greater, the carrier, special fund, or TPA shall file electronically a first report of injury with the board. The\nlapse of 18 days from the disability event or 10 days from the employer's\nknowledge of the disability event does not relieve the carrier, special fund or\nTPA from its obligation under this subdivision to file electronically a\nmandatory first report of injury. Such report shall be filed electronically in\nthe format prescribed by the chair and shall contain the data elements\nprescribed by the chair. (i) Medical only\ncases. When the disability event has not resulted in any compensable lost time\nand the carrier does not controvert the claim, the carrier, special fund or TPA\nmust electronically file a mandatory first report of injury in the manner\nprescribed herein indicating that the carrier, special fund or TPA is providing\ncoverage for medical expenses only. In such cases, the carrier, special fund or\nTPA is not required to file a subsequent report of injury except as set forth\nin paragraph (f)(2) of this section. When a carrier, special fund or TPA, takes\naction on the claim beyond payment of medical expenses, the action may not be\nincluded in a first report of injury, but rather must be electronically filed\nwith the board in a subsequent report of injury as set forth in subdivisions\n(c), (d) and (f) of this section, or must be filed in accordance with\nsubdivision (e) of this section.

An initial notice of controversy may always be\nfiled as a subsequent report of injury as set forth in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. When a carrier, special fund or TPA, takes action on the claim beyond\nthe initial notice of controversy, the action may not be included in a first\nreport of injury, but rather must be electronically filed with the board in a\nsubsequent report of injury as set forth in subdivision (c) of this section. Unless it is filed on or before the greater of 18 days after the disability\nevent or within 10 days after the employer has knowledge of the disability\nevent as required by paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a notice of controversy\nmay not be filed as a first report of injury. A notice that contains the\nrelevant elements, as prescribed by the chair, of the subsequent report of\ninjury and initial action shall be transmitted to the claimant and his or her\nattorney or licensed representative, if any, within one business day of the\ndate it is filed electronically with the chair.

However, a report of injury filed by an employer in satisfaction of the\nrequirements of subdivision (2) of section\n110\nof the Workers' Compensation Law is not a mandatory first report of injury\nunless such report is filed electronically by a carrier, special fund, or TPA\nin the format prescribed by the chair and contains all data elements prescribed\nby the chair as required in paragraph (1) of this subdivision.

In the event that a carrier, special fund, or TPA acquires responsibility for a claim transferred from another carrier, special fund or TPA, and a mandatory first report of injury has not yet been\nsubmitted to the board, such mandatory first report of injury shall be filed\nwithin 30 days of rejection by the board of the supplemental first report of\ninjury or within 30 days of the acquisition of responsibility from the previous\ncarrier, special fund or TPA when no supplemental first report of injury has\nbeen filed following acquisition. Such reports shall be filed electronically in\nthe format prescribed by the chair and shall contain the data elements\nprescribed by the chair.
