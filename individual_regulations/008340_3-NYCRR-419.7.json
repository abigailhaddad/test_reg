(d) Receipt of loss mitigation\napplication. (1)\nA servicer shall\nexercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information to\ncomplete a loss mitigation application, including but not limited to promptly\nfollowing up with the borrower to obtain any information the borrower has not\nsubmitted that is necessary to make the application complete and to ensure that\nthe servicer timely receives any necessary third-party information or\napprovals.

A servicer may evaluate an incomplete loss mitigation\napplication only if, despite the servicer's reasonable diligence to obtain\nnecessary documents and information, the loss mitigation application remains\nincomplete for 30 days without the borrower making reasonable progress to\ncomplete the application. Any such evaluation and offer is not subject to the\nrequirements of this section and shall not constitute an evaluation of a\ncomplete loss mitigation application for purposes of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision.

(iv)\n\nPayment\nforbearance.
