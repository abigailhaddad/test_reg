The following information must also be included at the time a permit\napplication is submitted to the department, unless otherwise specified: (a) A certification that all emission sources\nwhich are part of any major facility located in New York State and under the\napplicant's ownership or control (or under the ownership or control of any\nentity which controls, is controlled by, or has common control with the\napplicant) are in compliance, or are on a schedule for compliance, with all\napplicable emission limitations and standards under Chapter III of this\n\nTitle. (b) An analysis of\nalternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control\ntechniques which demonstrates that benefits of the proposed project or proposed\nmajor facility significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs\nimposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification within New\n\nYork State. (c) A LAER analysis in\naccordance with section\n231-6.5\nof this Subpart. (d) 'Emission offset and internal offset\ninformation for VOC or NO\nx\n'. At the time of the initial\npermit application or before the department issues a final permit determination\nfor a NSR major modification, the applicant must submit: (1)\na list which identifies the source(s) of\napproved or proposed ERCs of VOC or NO\nx\nthat will be\nused as an internal offset or required emission offset. This list must include\nthe name and location of the facility, DEC identification number, if\napplicable, and the emission reduction mechanism ('i.e.', facility shutdown, emission unit shutdown, source reduction, curtailment, over control of\nemissions beyond an applicable limit). All the proposed ERCs must be certified\nprior to the issuance of the final permit; (2)\na use of emission reduction credits form\n(duly completed and signed by the applicant and an authorized representative of\nthe ERC seller) to the department for each ERC source listed in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision. Upon issuance of the permit for the proposed modification, the NYS ERC Registry will be amended to reflect that the ERCs are committed as\nan internal offset or emission offset, as applicable, to the proposed\nmodification; and\n(3)\nfor emissions\nof VOC or NO\nx\nin an ozone nonattainment area, documentation of compliance with the contribution demonstration required\naccording to the department's policy documents on air quality impact analyses\npursuant to Subpart 231-12 of this Part.

This\nlist must include the name and location of the facility, DEC identification\nnumber, if applicable, and the emission reduction mechanism ('i.e.', facility\nshutdown, emission unit shutdown, source reduction, curtailment, over control\nof emissions beyond an applicable limit); (2)\na use of emission reduction credits form\n(duly completed and signed by the applicant and an authorized representative of\nthe ERC seller) for each ERC source listed in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. Upon issuance of the permit for the proposed modification, the NYS\nERC Registry will be amended to reflect that the ERCs are committed as emission\noffsets to the proposed modification; and\n(3)\nan air quality impact evaluation in\naccordance with the provisions of section 231-6. 6(d) o f this Subpart, Subpart\n231-12 of this Part, and department approved modeling\nprocedures.
