(b) (1)\n\nEmployees who enter State service on or after the effective date of this\n\nChapter shall, upon completion of 13 biweekly pay periods of service, be\ncredited with six and one-half days' vacation. Thereafter, each such employee\nshall earn and accumulate vacation credits at the rate of one-half day per\nbiweekly pay period until he has completed seven years of continuous service. An employee shall not earn vacation credit for any biweekly pay period unless\nhe is in full pay status for at least seven workdays during such biweekly pay\nperiod. (2)\nA part-time employee\nwho is required to work a fixed number of hours, five days per week, shall also\nreceive vacation as provided herein, but his total pay for such period of\nvacation shall be the amount which would have been due him if he had been\nworking regularly at his usual hours for such period. (c) Employees who enter State service on or\nafter the effective date of this Chapter shall also earn and, upon the\ncompletion of each full year of continuous service, be credited with additional\nvacation in accordance with the following schedule: Completed Years of Continuous\n\nService\n\nAdditional Vacation\n\nCredits\n1\n1 day\n2\n2 days\n3\n3 days\n4\n4 days\n5\n5 days\n6\n6 days\n7\n7 days\n(d) (1)\nA\nleave of absence without pay, or a resignation followed by reinstatement or\nreemployment in State service within one year following such resignation, shall\nnot constitute an interruption of continuous service for the purposes of this\nsection; provided, however, that leave without pay for more than six months or\nthe period between resignation and reinstatement for reappointment, during\nwhich the employee is not in State service, shall not be counted in determining\neligibility for additional vacation credits under this section. (2)\n\nDuring the second through the seventh\nyears of continuous service, credits not to exceed the number of additional\nvacation credits earned for the previously completed year of service, and in\nproportion to the number of pay periods served during the current year, may be\nadvanced to an employee to cover necessary absences where no other credits are\navailable. Compensation shall be granted for these credits in the event of\nlayoff, military leave or death of an employee. (3)\n\nAfter the anniversary date on which an\nemployee has been credited with seven days of additional vacation credits he\nshall thereafter earn vacation for completed biweekly pay periods at a rate\nwhich will equal 20 days for 26 such pay periods. (e) No accumulation of vacation credits in\nexcess of 30 days shall be permitted except that employees having accumulated\nvacation credits in excess of 30 days on the day preceding the effective date\nof this Chapter shall be allowed a period of one year to reduce such\naccumulated credits to an amount not in excess of 30 days. The appointing\nauthority shall notify the employee, in writing, of the total amount of his\nunliquidated credits when such credits total the equivalent of 25\nworkdays.

Other per diem and hourly paid employees shall earn and accumulate vacation at\nthe same rates and subject to the same conditions as apply to annual salaried\nemployees who enter State service on or after January 3, 1957, and, for the\npurpose of determining eligibility for additional vacation credits, each such\nemployee shall be credited with all years of continuous service rendered from\nthe beginning of the first nine months of his service by which he qualified for\ncoverage under this Chapter. Every per diem and hourly paid employee shall, on\nthe date on which he becomes subject to this Chapter, be credited with the\nnumber of days of vacation which he would have earned during the preceding nine\nmonths if he had been subject to this Chapter during such period, less the\nnumber of days of paid vacation which were granted to him during such\nnine-month period, except that no deduction shall be made for vacation drawn\nduring such nine-month period which was earned prior thereto in accordance with\nan established departmental policy.
