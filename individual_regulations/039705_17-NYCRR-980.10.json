  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 980.10 - Payment of state assistance to grant counties\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No payment of financial assistance shall\nbe made for any expense incurred by a rural county or its subcontractors prior\nto the date of written notice from the Department to the county that it has\nbeen awarded a grant. (b) No\npayment shall be made until a county has furnished to the Department proper and\nduly certified evidence of its commitment of the required local share of grant\ncosts and the name of its Services Coordinator. (c) Interim Payments. Unless otherwise agreed\nto by the Department, at the beginning of each three-month period (quarter) of\na grant, a grantee county shall submit a quarterly payment request voucher to\nthe Department, in a form prescribed by the Department, for that quarter of the\ngrant. Other than the first quarter, each voucher shall be accompanied by the\ncounty's interim progress report for the previous quarter. The amount requested\nin each quarterly voucher shall be the State share of the eligible costs of the\ngrant expected to be incurred in that quarter, adjusted to account for any\nestimated overpayment or underpayment for the previous quarter, provided that\nno interim payment will be made in an amount that would cause the aggregate\namount of all interim payments for the grant to exceed the State share of the\ntotal estimated grant costs. (d) Consolidated Payments. The Department may elect to combine or consolidate two\nor more interim payments to simplify grant processing or reduce program\nadministrative expenses. (e) Advance Payments. In accordance with applicable provisions of Section 73-j of\n\nArticle 2-F of the Transportation Law, the Department may choose to authorize\nwhole or partial payments to a grant county in advance of the time grant costs\nare actually incurred by the county or its subcontractors, provided that the\ncounty has requested such advance payment and has explained to the Department's\nsatisfaction why such payment is necessary. In considering whether to authorize\nany advance payment, the Department shall be guided by the degree of need for\nsame by the county and the potential impact of a denial of such advance payment\nupon the success of the county's transportation coordination project. The\n\nDepartment may require the county to submit additional information as may be\nnecessary as justification for an advance payment. No advance payment shall be\nmade to a county which will cause the total of all grant payments to exceed the\n\nState share of the total estimated grant cost. No payment of State funds can be\nmade prior to the appropriate Grant Agreement being executed by the\n\nState. (f) Within 60 days after the\ncompletion of a grant, as determined by the terms of the grant, the chief\nexecutive officer of the county, if any, or the chairperson of the county\nlegislative body shall forward to the Department a certified financial\nstatement identifying actual costs incurred, grant funds expended or\nencumbered, including any applicable county matching funds on forms provided by\nthe Department, in accordance with other conditions of this Part. (g) Final review and audit. The Department\nshall complete a final review of each county's grant, including the county's\ncertified financial statement and other documentation and grant reports. The\n\nDepartment or the Office of the State Comptroller may choose to audit a\ncounty's records and accounts pertaining to a grant, as part of its final\nreview. Upon completion of the Department's final review of a grant, should any\n\nState funds paid to the county remain unexpended or unencumbered after the\nexpenditure of required county share funds, the Department will credit such\nremaining State funds to the county's subsequent year grant under this Part. In\nno event shall the county's subsequent year's grant exceed the sum of $55,000\nfor planning or $35,000 for operating aid. Should the county not be a recipient\nof a subsequent year grant, it shall return such unexpended or unencumbered\n\nState funds to the Department, within 60 days of the receipt of written notice\nfrom the Department to do so. (h) Rural counties are empowered by Article 2-F of the Transportation Law to enter\ninto any agreement or contract with any private or public agencies, corporations or individuals necessary or convenient to carry out their\nresponsibilities under this Part. Program funds made available shall be\nprovided pursuant to the terms of such contracts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
