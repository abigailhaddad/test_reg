  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 202-2.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose\nof this Subpart, the general definitions of Parts 200 and 201 of this Title\napply: (b) The following definitions\ngovern the provisions of this Subpart: (1)\n'Actual annual emissions.' The actual (or estimated) emissions of a regulated\nair contaminant after control equipment has been applied, including fugitive\nemissions and emissions during startups, shutdowns, and malfunction conditions\nwhich occurred during the calendar year being reported. Actual annual emissions\nare based on actual operating conditions for the calendar year (i.e., actual\nfuel usage, actual material usage, actual operating rate) and are determined\nusing one of the methods listed in section\n202-2.4\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n'Annual process rate.'\nAn actual (or estimated) measurable parameter or quantity per calendar year\nthat directly or indirectly relates to the emissions of an air contaminant\nsource. Depending on the type of emission source, measurable quantity or\nparameter may refer to the amount of fuel combusted, raw material processed, product manufactured, or material handled or processed. The measurable quantity\nor parameter is typically the value that is multiplied by an emission factor to\ngenerate an emission estimate. (3)\n'Annual reportable emissions.' The actual annual emissions of a facility\nsubject to this Subpart. In addition, every three years annual reportable\nemissions shall include the actual annual emissions of exempt emission sources\nas defined in section\n201-3.2\nof this Title. Emissions\nfrom exempt sources are required to be reported every three years as part of\nthe periodic emission inventory as set forth in section\n202-2.3\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart. (4)\n'Chemical abstracts\nservice registry number.' A CAS (chemical abstracts service) registry number is\na unique numeric identifier which designates only one substance and has no\nchemical significance other than to link information about a specific chemical\nsubstance. (5)\n'Chemical family\ncode.' A chemical family code is defined as the numerical code associated with\na specific chemical family as determined in the following table: Chemical Family Code\n1. Particulates (PART)\n2. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)\n3. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)\n4. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)\n5. Carbon Monoxide (CO)\n6. Other\n7. PM-10\n8. Particulates and Hazardous Air Pollutant\n(HAP)\n9. VOC and HAP\n10. HAP Only\n11. PM2.5\n12. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)\n13. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)\n(6)\n'Control equipment type.' The type of\ncontrol equipment used by a facility to regulate air emissions. The control\nequipment description reported on the emissions statement shall be consistent\nwith the appropriate description contained in a list provided by the department\nfor emission statement reporting purposes. (7)\n'Control efficiency.' The effectiveness\nof air pollution control equipment expressed as the percentage of the actual\ntotal emissions of an air contaminant prevented by the air pollution control\nequipment from being emitted into the outdoor atmosphere. Control efficiency is\ncalculated by dividing the weight of such air contaminant collected, removed, or rendered less noxious (during a specific unit of time) by the control\nequipment, including equipment downtime and maintenance degradation, by the\nuncontrolled emission rate (based on an equal unit of time) of the contaminant, and multiplying by 100 percent. (8)\n'Design capacity.' A measure of the size of a point source, based on the\nreported maximum continuous capacity of the emission generating\nequipment. (9)\n'Emission factor.'\nAn average value which relates the quantity of an air contaminant released to\nthe atmosphere as a result of an associated activity or material throughput\nlevel, usually expressed as the weight of an air contaminant divided by a unit\nweight, volume, distance or duration of the activity that emits the air\ncontaminant (e.g., pounds of particulate matter emitted per ton of coal\ncombusted). (10)\n'Emissions method\ncode.' The code which identifies how emissions were determined for emission\nstatement reporting purposes. Emissions must be calculated using the methods\ndescribed by these codes. (11)\n'Exit gas flow rate.' Numerical value of stack gas flow rate\n(mass/time). (12)\n'Exit gas\ntemperature.' Numerical value of stack gas temperature (oC or oF). (13)\n'Exit gas velocity.' Numerical value of\nstack gas velocity (distance/time). (14)\n'Material balance.' The process of\ndetermining emissions by comparing the material inputs of a process with the\namount of material outputs of the process. For example, a certain chemical of a\nknown quantity used in a process may be emitted to the atmosphere, retained in\nthe product, destroyed in the process, or physically removed for reprocessing\nor disposal. (15)\n'Maximum\nnameplate capacity.' A measure of a unit's size which the manufacturer includes\non the unit's nameplate. (16)\n'NAICS.' North American Industry Classification System. NAICS is a\nclassification of business establishments by economic activity. It was adopted\nby Canada, Mexico, and the United States on January 1, 1997, to replace the\n\nStandard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. (17)\n'Peak carbon monoxide season.' The\nmonths of January, February and December in a given calendar year. (18)\n'Peak ozone season.' The period from\n\nJune 1st through August 31st, inclusive in a given calendar year. (19)\n'Percent annual throughput.' The percent\nof the total yearly operation of a process which occurs during each of the\nfollowing periods: January, February, and December; March through May; June\nthrough August; and September through November. (20)\n'SCC.' Source Classification Code. A\nprocess-level code that describes the equipment and/or operation which is\nemitting pollutants. (21)\n'Stack\ndiameter.' The inside diameter or cross section at the exit of a stack or vent, expressed to the nearest inch. (22)\n'Stack height.' The height of the stack measured from ground level to the top\nof the stack or vent, expressed to the nearest foot. (23)\n'Start time (hour).' The hour of the day\nthat the process equipment begins operation. This is the starting time used to\ncalculate emission estimates for that equipment. (24)\n'Work weekday.' Any day of the week\nexcluding Saturday or and Sunday. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
