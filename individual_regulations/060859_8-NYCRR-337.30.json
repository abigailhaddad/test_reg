  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 337.30 - Disability leave\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon being\ndiscontinued from service in accordance with provisions of the State University\n\nGroup Disability Insurance Program, an employee shall be granted a leave\nwithout pay for disability and shall be continued on such leave without pay\nuntil the disability ceases, the employee reaches age 65, or death, whichever\nevent occurs first. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after five calendar years on\nsuch leave, an employee shall not have any right or entitlement to be restored\nto regular employment status. For purposes of the State University Group\n\nDisability Insurance Program, the chief administrative officer may require an\nemployee to be examined by a physician selected by the college at its expense. Determination that a disability exists may be made by the chief administrative\nofficer upon the advice of the college's examining physician. Notwithstanding\nthe failure of an employee to cooperate with the college's examining physician, a determination that a disability exists may be made by the chief\nadministrative officer upon advice of the college's examining physician that\nthere are reasonable grounds to assume that a disability benefit would be\npayable in accordance with the State University Group Disability Insurance\n\nProgram. If the chief administrative officer determines, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this section, that a disability exists, the employee must apply\nfor disability benefits under the State University Group Disability Insurance\n\nProgram. In the event the employee does not apply for disability benefits, the\nemployee shall be placed on disability leave without pay. If, upon a finding\nthat an employee is not disabled, the disability insurance carrier disapproves\nan employee's application for benefits, the employee shall be restored to\nregular employment status. (b) Discontinuation from service of employees not covered by the State University\n\nGroup Disability Insurance Program. Upon being discontinued from service as a\nresult of a disability which prevents performance of the employee's duties, an\nemployee shall be granted a leave without pay until the disability ceases, the\nemployee reaches age 65, or death, whichever event occurs first. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after five calendar years on such leave, an\nemployee shall not have any right or entitlement to be restored to regular\nemployment status. For purposes of determining the existence of such a\ndisability, the chief administrative officer may require an employee to be\nexamined by a physician selected by the college at its expense. Determination\nthat a disability exists may be made by the chief administrative officer upon\nthe advice of the college's examining physician. Notwithstanding the failure of\nan employee to cooperate with the college's examining physician, a\ndetermination that a disability exists may be made by the chief administrative\nofficer upon advice of the college's examining physician that there are\nreasonable grounds to assume that a disability exists which would prevent an\nemployee from performing the employee's duties. If the chief administrative\nofficer determines, in accordance with the provisions of this section, that\nsuch a disability exists, the employee shall be placed on a disability leave\nwithout pay. Where appropriate, the chief administrative officer, after\nconsulting with the college's examining physician, may refer the employee to an\nemployee assistance program or to other service agencies. The employee, however, shall be permitted to use any and all sick leave credits which have\nbeen accumulated pursuant to sections\n337.7\nand\n337.8\nof this Part and may request\nadditional sick leave pursuant to section\n337.11\nof this Part. An employee\nwho has been placed on disability leave without pay pursuant to this section\nmay subsequently request to be restored to regular employment status. Such\nrequest must be submitted in writing to the chief administrative officer\naccompanied by suitable medical evidence from the employee's physician that the\nemployee no longer has a disability which would prevent performance of the\nemployee's duties. Following receipt of such submissions, the chief\nadministrative officer may require the employee to be examined by a physician\nselected by the college at its expense prior to making a determination whether\nto restore the employee to regular employment status. Upon a finding by the\ncollege's examining physician that the employee no longer has a disability\nwhich would prevent performance of the employee's duties, the employee shall be\nrestored to regular employment status. Upon a finding by the college's\nexamining physician that the employee continues to have a disability which\nprevents performance of the employee's duties, the chief administrative officer\nmay require the employee to be examined by a physician from the New York State\n\nDepartment of Civil Service Employee Health Service at the college's expense\nprior to making a determination whether to restore the employee to regular\nemployment status. The determination of whether to restore the employment\nstatus may be made by the chief administrative officer upon the advice of the\nphysician from the employee health service concerning the existence of a\ndisability which would prevent the employee from performing the employee's\nduties.
