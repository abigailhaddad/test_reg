  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 556.1 - Oil wells\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The operating practice requirements of subdivisions (b) through (h) of this\nsection shall be applicable only to oil wells. (b) All oil wells capable of production shall\nbe equipped with welhead controls adequate to properly contain and control the\nflow thereof. (c) All flowing oil\nwells except those flowed artificially as a result of water flooding or other\nsecondary recovery techniques must be flowed through an adequate oil and gas\nseparator. In addition, connections or fittings of size adequate to permit\nefficient measurement of the effluent gas by meter or orifice or other\nindustry-accepted well tester for the purpose of obtaining gas-oil ratios shall\nbe installed on the gas vent line of said separator. Wellhead equipment also\nshall be installed and maintained in first-class condition so that static\nbottom hole pressure may be obtained at any reasonable time by the department\nafter notification to the owner or operator and valves shall be installed so\nthat surface pressures can readily be obtained on both casing and\ntubing. (d) Except where some\nalternative rules governing a specific pool are in effect, the owner or\noperator of any oil well producing from a pool which contains both oil and gas\nshall be required at least once each calendar year to measure the gas-oil ratio\nof said well and report same to the department on form OG14. Unless the owner\nor operator wishes some alternative reporting time, the gas-oil ratio report\nshould be flled with the annual production report on form OG2 as specified in\nsection\n551.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. At the option of the owner or operator of the well, or upon written\nrequest from the department, in order to demonstrate the status of the well on\na more current basis, the gas-oil ratio test may be made at a more frequent\ninterval and the resuits thereof filed with the department on form OG14. Such\nmore recent test shall remain in effect until the annual test shall again be\nrequired. (e) Each oil well shall\nbe permitted to produce without penalty of a restriction in oil production only\nthat volume of gas equivalent to the applicable limiting gas-oil ratio\nmultiplied by the oil production potential of the well as determined by the\nproduction rate reported on form OG14. In the event the department has not\nestablished a specific gas-oil ratio limit for a particular oil pool, the\nlimiting gas-oil ratio shall be 2,000 cubic feet for each barrel of oil\nproduction. If the gas-oil ratio exceeds 2,000 cubic feet of gas for each\nbarrel of oil, it shall be unlawful to produce more oil than is determined by\nmultiplying the oil production potential of the well as reported on form OG14\nby a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the limiting gas-oil ratio for\nthe pool and the denominator of which shall be the official gas-oil ratio test\nof the well as reported on form OG14. All gas produced with the current oil\nproduction pursuant to the foregoing ruling shall be deemed to have been\nlawfully produced. (f) All wells or\ndeveloped spacing units which are to be restricted in production because of\nhigh gas-oil ratios will be so indicated in a production schedule prepared by\nthe department. (g) Upon the\napplication therefor by any interested owner or operator, or on the\ndepartment's own motion, a limiting gas-oil ratio shall be established only\nafter appropriate notice and public hearing. Subsequent hearings may be held in\nthe same manner for the purpose of considering a change in the limiting gas-oil\nratio when there is apparent good cause for such revision. (h) Water-oil ratio surveys and reports shall\nbe conducted by the owner or operator or any producing oil well or wells upon\nrequest of the department. Such request may be made on the department's own\nmotion or as a result of a petition therefor and subsequent demonstration of\ngood cause in a public hearing. After a study of the results of the water-oil\nratio survey by the department and all interested owners or operators to whom\nsame shall be made available by the department upon request, a public hearing\nwill be held and a ruling issued by the department on the establishment of\nwater-oil ratio limits and restrictions in oil production as a result of\nexcessive water production.
