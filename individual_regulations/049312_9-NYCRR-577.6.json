  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 577.6 - Restrictions and standards in river areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General rule. All land uses and\ndevelopments in river areas, whether or not an agency permit is required, shall\nbe subject to the restrictions and standards set forth in this\nsection. (b) Structures. (1)\n\nIn wild river areas, no new structures\nshall be permitted, except footbridges for nonmotorized open space recreation\nuse. (2)\n\nIn scenic river areas, new\nstructures, except for fences, poles, signs of less than two square feet in\narea, lean-tos, docks, bridges and stream improvement structures for fishery\nmanagement purposes, shall not be permitted inside the mean high water mark of\nthe river or within 250 feet of the mean high water mark, except in hamlet and\nmoderate intensity use areas. (3)\n\nIn recreational river areas, new structures, except for fences, poles, signs of\nless than two square feet in area, lean-tos, docks, boathouses, bridges and\nstream improvement structures for fishery management purposes, shall not be\npermitted inside the mean high water mark of the river or within 150 feet of\nthe mean high water mark, except in hamlet and moderate intensity use\nareas. (4)\n\nWithin hamlet and\nmoderate intensity use areas in scenic and recreational river areas, the\nbuilding setback restrictions of section 806 of the Adirondack Park Agency Act\nand section\n575.1\nof this Title shall\napply. (c) Forest\nmanagement and vegetative cutting. In wild river areas and in scenic and\nrecreational river areas outside hamlet and moderate intensity use areas, the\nfollowing standards apply: (1)\n\nInside the\nmean high water mark of the river, or within 100 feet of the mean high water\nmark, no trees or other vegetation shall be harvested, cut, culled, removed, thinned or otherwise disturbed, other than: (i) the cutting and removal of up to a\nmaximum of five percent of the total basal area of timber or other vegetation\nper acre during any 10-year period for the purpose of clearing the river or a\ntributary thereof of fallen trees, or trees which pose a threat of bank\nundercutting or erosion, or for the undertaking of land use and development or\nsubdivision listed in section\n577.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart; (ii)\nvegetative cutting upon\nlands directly associated with any structure lawfully in existence on April 19, 1976, to the extent necessary that any existing view of the river from such\nstructure may be preserved; (iii)\nthe cutting of firewood by the resident of a dwelling within the river area for\npersonal use in such dwelling, provided that alternative sites for the cutting\nof such firewood are not readily available to such resident; or\n(iv)\nin accordance with the terms of an\nagency rivers project permit. (2)\n\nBetween 100 feet from the mean high water\nmark of the river and the exterior boundary of the river area: (i) The cutting and removal of trees and\nother vegetation shall be permitted for the undertaking of rivers projects, land use and development or subdivision listed in section\n577.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart, or activities pursuant to a rivers system land management plan. (ii)\n\nForest management shall conform to\nrecognized silvicultural systems as defined in\n\nThe Dictionary of\n\nForestry\n(Society of American Foresters. 1998) appropriate to the\nsite, and shall be in accordance with the terms of the latest edition of the\n\nNew York State Forestry Best Management Practices for Water Quality: BMP Field Guide\n(Watershed Agricultural Council Forestry Program. New\n\nYork State Department of Environmental Conservation, and Empire State Forest\n\nProducts Association'). (iii)\n\nIf an\neven-aged stand of commercial timber species is present, one recognized\nregeneration cutting that removes the main crown canopy of such stand shall be\npermitted upon not more than one third of the total area of the stand within\nthe river area during any 10-year period if undertaken as part of a plan to\nregenerate the stand. (iv)\n\nIn no\nevent, however, shall more than 15 contiguous acres in the same ownership be\nclearcut, nor shall more than 50 percent of the basal area of timber in any\ntract of 30 contiguous acres in the same ownership be cut during any 10-year\nperiod. (3)\n\nNo trees\nshall be felled into or across the river where avoidable, and logging debris\nwhich may enter the river shall be removed. Any logging debris which may enter\nthe area inside the mean high water mark of the river or within 100 feet of\nsuch mean high water mark shall be removed, or shall be lopped, for hardwoods, in such fashion that no such debris measures higher than four feet from ground\nlevel, and for conifers, in accordance with section\n9-1113\nof the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw. (4)\n\nNo new landings shall be\nestablished inside the mean high water mark of the river or within 200 feet of\nthe mean high water mark.

(5)\n\nNo new sand and\ngravel extractions associated with forest management shall be located inside\nthe mean high water mark of the river or within 200 feet of the mean high water\nmark.

(6)\n\nAll timber harvesting operations shall be\nsubject to article 15 (Water Resources) of the Environmental Conservation Law, governing, among other things, disturbances, modification and crossing of\nrivers and streams. In addition, skidding of logs or trees across rivers shall\nnot be permitted, except where no feasible alternative exists and a permit\ntherefor has been obtained pursuant to such article. (7)\n\nLogging equipment shall not be stored\nwithin 100 feet of the river, or abandoned within the river area.
