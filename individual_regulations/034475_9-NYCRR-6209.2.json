  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6209.2 - Polling place voting system requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In order for a polling place voting\nsystem to be considered by the State Board for certification, it must comply\nwith the mandates of New York State Election Law, and meet the Election\n\nAssistance Commission's 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, to the extent\nthat they are consistent with State law and this Part. Such polling place\nvoting systems shall meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nProvide a full ballot display on a single\nsurface, except that proposals may appear on the reverse side of any paper\nballot, and that such ballot display is easily visible under typical lighting\nfound in a poll site. (2)\n\nFor\njurisdictions within the State of New York that have been identified by the\nU.S. Department of Justice, as requiring that ballots be provided in alternate\nlanguages, pursuant to section 203 of the Voting Rights Act, 42\nUSC\n1973aa-1a. Voting systems must be able to\nrecognize and interpret alternate language ballots. (3)\n\nProvide a device that produces and\nretains a voter-verifiable permanent paper record, pursuant to statute, which\nthe voter can review and/or correct prior to the casting of their vote. In the\ncase of a paper-based voting system, the ballot marked by the voter shall\nconstitute the paper record referred to in subdivision (f) of this section. The\npaper record shall allow a manual audit and allow for preservation in\naccordance with the provisions of Election Law, section 3-222. (4)\n\nProvide a device or means by which the\nrecord of the votes cast on the machine can be printed and visually reviewed\nafter the polls are closed. (5)\n\nProvide a battery power source in the event that the electric supply used to\nmake the voting system equipment function, is disrupted. The battery power\nsource shall operate the system and allow for the casting of votes for a period\nnot less than two hours, to ensure that the system can shut down and preserve\nthe integrity of votes cast prior to the power failure, and can resume\nfunctionality when power is provided or restored without significant or\nintrusive power-up procedures. Such batteries must be rechargeable and have\nminimum five-year life when used under normal conditions. In the event of a\npower failure, the equipment shall perform a normal shut-down not less than one\nhour before battery power is depleted, and shall notify the election inspector\nthat the system will do so. (6)\n\nThe\nsystem shall contain software and hardware required to perform a diagnostic\ntest of system status, and a means of simulating the random selection of\ncandidates and casting of ballots in quantities sufficient to demonstrate that\nthe system is fully operational and that all voting positions are\noperable. (7)\n\nThe system shall\nincorporate multiple memories, including resident vote tabulation, storage of\nresults and ballot images in resident memory, serving as a redundant means of\nverifying or auditing election results and ballot images, and further, the\nsystem shall be required to alert the election day worker that memory capacity\nis about to be reached. (8)\n\nIn a\nDRE voting system, the system must prevent voters from overvoting and indicate\nto the voter specific contests or ballot issues for which no selection or an\ninsufficient number of selections has been made. A ballot marking device must\nprevent voters from overvoting and indicate to the voter specific contests or\nballot issues for which no selection or an insufficient number of selections\nhas been made. A ballot counting scanner must indicate to the voter specific\ncontests or ballot issues for which an overvote is detected. (9)\n\nThe voting system shall provide a method\nfor write-in voting and shall report the number of votes cast in each contest\nin write-in voting positions. (10)\n\nThe voting system shall be capable of accumulating and reporting a count of the\nnumber of ballots tallied for an election district and votes cast for each\ncandidate, and the total vote for or against each ballot proposal, and shall be\ncapable of separating and tabulating those election district totals to produce\na report of the total of ballots tallied by groups of election districts such\nas legislative districts or wards. (b) In addition to the requirements of\nsubdivision (a) of this section, fully-accessible voting equipment certified by\nthe State Board shall meet the following requirements for usability by voters\nwho are disabled: (1)\n\nThe voting system or\nequipment shall be equipped with a voting device with tactile discernible\ncontrols, pursuant to Election Law, section 7-202. S uch controls shall allow\npersons with limited reach and/or hand dexterity, the ability to cast their\nvote, and shall include, for example: raised buttons of different shapes and\ncolors, large or raised numbers or letters, and light pressure\nswitches. (2)\n\nThe voting system or\nequipment shall be equipped with an audio voting feature, pursuant to Election\n\nLaw, section 7-202. T he audio feature shall be able to be used either\nindependently or simultaneously with the on-screen display. (3)\n\nThe voting system or equipment shall be\ncapable of being equipped with a pneumatic switch, pursuant to Election Law, section 7-202. (c) Standards for noise level. (1)\n\nVoting systems\nor equipment to be certified by the State Board shall be constructed in a\nmanner so that noise levels of the system or equipment during operation will\nnot interfere with the duties of the election inspectors or the voting\npublic. (2)\n\nThe noise level of\nwrite-in components of the system or equipment shall be so minimal that it will\nbe virtually impossible under normal conditions for someone at the table used\nby the inspectors of elections to determine that a write-in vote is being cast\nor has been cast. (d) Standards for voter privacy. (1)\n\nVoting\nsystems or equipment shall be constructed so that no one within the polling\nsite will be able to see how a voter is casting a vote. (2)\n\nCurtains, screens, shields or other\nprivacy devices shall be designed so as to allow any voter, either\nelectronically or manually, to open, close or otherwise use the device with\nease when entering and exiting the system or equipment. (e) Environmental standards. The voting\nsystem shall be designed to protect against dust and moisture during storage\nand transportation. Testing shall be similar to the procedure of MIL-STD-810F, Method 510.4, for dust, and MIL-STD- 810F, Method 506.4 for moisture. These\ntests are intended to evaluate exposure to these elements when the system or\nequipment is in a non-operating configuration and the equipment or system's\nrequired protective cover is in place. (f) Voter verified paper audit trails\n(VVPAT). (1)\n\nThe voting system shall print\nand display a paper record of the voter's ballot choices prior to the voter\nmaking the ballot choices final. In the case of a paper-based voting system, the ballot marked by the voter shall constitute the paper record referred to in\nthis subdivision. (i) The paper record shall\nconstitute a complete record of ballot choices that can be used in audits of\nthe accuracy of the voting systems electronic records, in audits of the\nelection results, and in full recounts. (ii)\n\nIn the case of a DRE voting system, the\npaper record shall contain all information stored in the electronic\nrecord. (iii)\n\nThe voting system\nshall be capable of showing the information on both the display screen and the\npaper in a font size of 3.0mm, and should be capable of showing the information\nin at least two font ranges: (a) 3.0-4.0 mm; and\n(b) 6.3-9.0 mm, under control\nof the voter. (iv)\n\nIn\nthe case of a DRE voting system, the paper and electronic display of the\nvoter's selections shall be presented and positioned so as to allow the voter\nto easily read and compare the two. (v) If the paper record cannot be displayed\nin its entirety, a means for moving the paper to show all paper record contents\nshall be provided. (2)\n\nThere shall be instructions for performing the verification process made\navailable to the voter in a location on the voting system. (3)\n\nThe voting system shall display, print, and store a paper record in any of the alternative languages chosen for making\nballot selections. Candidate names and other markings not related to the ballot\nselection on the paper record shall appear in English. (4)\n\nThe voting system shall allow the voter\nto approve or reject the paper record, in the case of DRE systems, marking the\nballot as such in the presence of the voter. (i) Any DRE voting system shall provide a\nmeans to reconcile the number of rejected paper records with the number of\noccurrences of rejected electronic selections, and procedures shall be in place\nto address any discrepancies. (ii)\n\nPrior to reaching the maximum number of ballots allowed pursuant to statute, any DRE voting system shall display a warning message to the voter indicating\nthe voter may reject only one more ballot, and that the third ballot shall\nbecome the ballot of record. (5)\n\nIn case of conditions that prevent voter\nreview of the paper record, there shall be a means for the voter to notify an\nelection official, and in the case of a DRE voting system, shall cause an error\nmessage to be displayed and shall prevent the recording of the electronic\nrecord. (6)\n\nIn the case of a DRE\nvoting system, procedures by which an election official can be notified and\nprescribed actions can be taken to address discrepancies if a voter indicates\nthat the electronic and paper records do not match, shall be\ndocumented. (7)\n\nThe voting system\nshall not record the electronic record as being approved by the voter until the\npaper record has been stored. (8)\n\nVendor documentation shall include procedures for returning a voting system to\ncorrect operation after a voter has used it incompletely or incorrectly; this\nprocedure shall not cause discrepancies between the tallies of the electronic\nand paper records. (9)\n\nThe voter's\nprivacy and anonymity shall be preserved during the process of recording, verifying, and auditing ballot choices. (i) The privacy and anonymity of the voter's verification of ballot choices and the\ncreation and storage of these choices, both electronically and on paper record, shall be maintained. (ii)\n\nThe\nprivacy and anonymity of voters whose paper records contain any of the\nalternative languages chosen for making ballots selections shall be\nmaintained. (iii)\n\nInformation for\nthe purposes of auditing the electronic or paper records that may permit a\nvoter to reveal his or her ballot choices shall be displayed so as not to be\nmemorable to the voter. (10)\n\nThe voting system's ballot records shall\nbe structured and contain information so as to support highly precise audits of\ntheir accuracy. (i) All cryptographic\nsoftware in the voting system shall have been approved by the U.S. Government's\n\nCrypto Module Validation Program (CMVP) as applicable. (ii)\n\nThis information shall contain, but not\nbe limited to, the voting site/election district, type of election, ballot\nstyle, and whether the system is operating in a \"test\" mode. (11)\n\nIn the case of a DRE voting\nsystem, the electronic and paper records shall be linked by including a unique\nidentifier within each record that can be used to identify each record uniquely\nand correspond the two accordingly. (12)\n\nThe voting system shall generate and\nstore a digital signature for each electronic record. (13)\n\nThe electronic records shall be able to\nbe exported for auditing or analysis on standards-based and/or information\ntechnology computing platforms. (i) The\nexported electronic records shall be in an open, non-proprietary\nformat. (ii)\n\nThe voting system\nshall export the records accompanied by a digital signature of the collection\nof records, which shall be calculated on the entire set of electronic records\nand their associated digital signatures. (iii)\n\nThe voting system vendor shall provide\ndocumentation as to the structure of the exported records and how they shall be\nread and processed by software. (iv)\n\nThe vendor shall provide a software\nprogram that will display the exported records and such software may include\nother capabilities, such as providing vote tallies and indications of\nundervotes. (14)\n\nThe\nvoting system printers shall be physically secure from tampering. (i) The voting system shall communicate with\nits printers over a standard, publicly documented printer port using a standard\ncommunication protocol. (ii)\n\nThe\npaper path between the printing, viewing and storage of the paper record shall\nbe protected and sealed from access except by authorized election\nofficials. (iii)\n\nThe printer shall\nnot be permitted to communicate with any other system or machine other than the\nsingle voting system to which it is connected. (iv)\n\nThe printer shall only be able to\nfunction as a printer: it cannot store information or contain or provide any\nservices that are not essential to system function, (e.g., provide copier or\nfax functions) or have network capability. (v) Printer access to replace consumables\nsuch as ink or paper shall only be granted if it does not compromise the sealed\nprinter paper path. (vi)\n\nPrior to\nthe opening of polls on election day, poll workers shall demonstrate that the\nballot storage devices are empty. The storage devices shall then be sealed and\nno further access shall be provided to polling place workers. (vii)\n\nTamper-evident seals or physical\nsecurity measures shall protect the connection between the printer and the\nvoting machine, so that the connection cannot be broken or interfered with\nwithout leaving extensive and obvious evidence. (15)\n\nThe voting system's printers shall be\nhighly reliable and easily maintained. (i) The voting system should include a printer port to which a commercial\noff-the-shelf printer which complies with paragraph (14) of this subdivision, could be attached for the purposes of printing paper records and any additional\nrecords. (ii)\n\nThe voting system\nshall detect errors and malfunctions such as paper jams or low supplies of\nconsumables such as paper and ink that may prevent paper records from being\ncorrectly displayed, printed and stored. (iii)\n\nIf an error or malfunction occurs, the\nvoting equipment attached to the defective printer shall suspend voting\noperations and shall present a clear indication to the voter and election\nworkers of the error or malfunction. (iv)\n\nThere shall be adequate supplies of\nconsumable items such as paper and printer ink on hand to operate from opening\nto closing of polls. (a) Printing devices\nshould contain paper and ink of sufficient capacity so as not to require\nreloading or opening equipment covers or enclosures and circumvention of\nsecurity features, or reloading shall be able to be accomplished with minimal\ndisruption to voting and without circumvention of security features such as\nseals. (b) Printer consumables\nshall be stored within the temperature and humidity ranges specified by the\nmanufacturer and shall be stored in State Board-approved containers to protect\nthem from sustaining any damage.
