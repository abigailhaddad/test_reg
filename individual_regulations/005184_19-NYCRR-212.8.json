Tit. 19 § 212.8 - Method of judging and scoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The method of judging professional mixed martial contests or exhibitions must\ncomply with the Ten-Point-Must System of scoring professional\nmatches. (b) Under the 10-Point\n\nMust Scoring System, 10 points must be awarded tothe winner of the round and 9\npoints or less must be awarded to the loser, except for arare even round, which\nis scored 10-10. (c) Judges shall\nevaluate mixed martial artstechniques, such as effective\nstriking/effectivegrappling, effective aggressiveness, and control of the\nring/fightingarea. (d) Evaluations\nshall be made in the order inwhich the four techniques appear in paragraph c\nabove, and as directed by paragraph (k) below, giving the most weight in\nscoring to effectivestriking/effective grappling, effective aggressiveness,and\ncontrol of the fighting area. (e) Effective striking is judged by determining the total number of legalstrikes\nlanded by a contestant and the impact of the strikes. (f) Effective grappling is judged by\nconsidering theamount of successful executions of a legal takedown and\nreversals, and their impact. (g) Fighting area control is judged by determining who is dictating the\npace,location and position of the bout. Examples of factors to consider are\ncountering agrappler's attempt at takedown by remaining standing and legally\nstriking, taking downan opponent to force a ground fight, creating threatening\nsubmission attempts, passingthe guard to achieve mount, and creating striking\nopportunities. (h) Effectiveaggressiveness means moving forward and landing a legal\nstrike. (i) Effective defensemeans\navoiding being struck, taken down or reversed while countering with\noffensiveattacks. (j) The\nfollowing objective scoring criteria shall be utilized by the judges when\nscoring a round, and is provided as a general non-exclusive guideline for\npurposes of illustration: (1)\na round is to\nbe scored as a 10-10 round when both contestantsappear to be fighting evenly\nand neither contestant shows clear dominance in a round; (2)\na round is to be scored as a 10-9 round\nwhen onecontestant wins by a close margin,landing the greater number of\neffective legal strikes, grappling and other maneuvers; (3)\na round is to be scored as a 10-8 round\nwhen onecontestant overwhelminglydominates (wins by a large margin) by striking\nor grappling in a round; (4)\na\nround is to be scored as a 10-7round when onecontestant totally dominates by\nstriking or grappling in a round. (k) Judges shall use a sliding scale and\nrecognize the length of time the fighters are eitherstanding or on the ground, as follows: (1)\n\nIf the mixed martial artists\nspent a majority ofa round on the canvas, then: (i) Effective grappling is weighed first; and\n(ii)\n\nEffectivestriking is then\nweighed; (2)\n\nIf the\nmixed martial artists spent a majority of a roundstanding, then: (i) Effective striking is weighed first; and\n(ii)\n\nEffective grappling is\nthenweighed;and\n(3)\n\nIf a\nround ends with a relatively even amount of standingand canvasfighting, striking and grappling are weighed equally. (l) Incomplete rounds should be scored\nutilizing the same criteria as the scoring of other rounds up to the point said\nincomplete round is stopped. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
