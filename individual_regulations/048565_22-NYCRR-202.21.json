A trial by jury\nmay be demanded as provided by CPLR 4102. Where a jury trial has been demanded, the action or special proceeding shall be scheduled for jury trial upon payment\nof the fee prescribed by CPLR 8020 by the party first filing the demand. If no\ndemand for a jury trial is made, it shall constitute a waiver by all parties\nand the action or special proceeding shall be scheduled for nonjury\ntrial. (d) Pretrial\nproceedings. Where a party is prevented from filing a note of issue and\ncertificate of readiness because a pretrial proceeding has not been completed\nfor any reason beyond the control of the party, the court, upon motion\nsupported by affidavit, may permit the party to file a note of issue upon such\nconditions as the court deems appropriate. Where unusual or unanticipated\ncircumstances develop subsequent to the filing of a note of issue and\ncertificate of readiness which require additional pretrial proceedings to\nprevent substantial prejudice, the court, upon motion supported by affidavit, may grant permission to conduct such necessary proceedings. (e) Vacating note of issue. Within 20 days after service of a note of issue and certificate of readiness, any party to the action or special proceeding may move to vacate the note of\nissue, upon affidavit showing in what respects the case is not ready for trial, and the court may vacate the note of issue if it appears that a material fact\nin the certificate of readiness is incorrect, or that the certificate of\nreadiness fails to comply with the requirements of this section in some\nmaterial respect. However, the 20-day time limitation to make such motion shall\nnot apply to tax assessment review proceedings. After such period, except in a\ntax assessment review proceeding, no such motion shall be allowed except for\ngood cause shown. At any time, the court on its own motion may vacate a note of\nissue if it appears that a material fact in the certificate of readiness is\nincorrect, or that the certificate of readiness fails to comply with the\nrequirements of this section in some material respect. If the motion to vacate\na note of issue is granted, a copy of the order vacating the note of issue\nshall be served upon the clerk of the trial court. (f) Reinstatement of note of\nissue. Motions to reinstate notes of issue vacated pursuant to this section\nshall be supported by a proper and sufficient certificate of readiness and by\nan affidavit by a person having first-hand knowledge showing that there is\nmerit to the action, satisfactorily showing the reasons for the acts or\nomissions which led to the note of issue being vacated, stating meritorious\nreasons for its reinstatement and showing that the case is presently ready for\ntrial. (g) Limited\nspecification of damages demanded in certain actions. This subdivision shall\napply only in counties where the Chief Administrator of the Courts has\nestablished arbitration programs pursuant to Part 28 of the Rules of the Chief\n\nJudge of the State of New York pertaining to the arbitration of certain actions\n(22 NYCRR Part\n28\n). In a medical malpractice action or an action against a\nmunicipality seeking a sum of money only, where the party filing the note of\nissue is prohibited by the provisions of CPLR 3017(c) from stating in the\npleadings the amount of damages sought in the action, the party shall indicate\non the note of issue whether the amount of damages exceeds $6,000, exclusive of\ncosts and interest. If it does not, the party shall also indicate if it exceeds\n$2,000, exclusive of costs and interest. (h) Change in title of action. In the\nevent of a change in title of an action by reason of a substitution of any\nparty, no new note of issue will be required. Notice of such substitution and\nchange in title shall be given to the assigned judge and to the clerk within 10\ndays of the date of an order or stipulation effecting the party substitution or\ntitle change. (i) Additional requirements with respect to uncontested matrimonial actions. (1)\n\nUncontested matrimonial\nactions, proceedings for dissolution of marriages and applications for\ndeclaratory judgments shall be assigned to judges or special parts of court as\nthe Chief Administrator shall authorize. (2)\n\nThere shall be a Unified Court System\n\nUncontested Divorce Packet which shall contain the official forms for use in\nuncontested matrimonial actions. The packet shall be available in the office of\nthe clerk of the Supreme Court in each county, and the forms shall be filed\nwith the appropriate clerk in accordance with the instructions in the packet. These forms shall be accepted by the Court for obtaining an uncontested\ndivorce, and no other forms shall be necessary. The Court, in its discretion, may accept other forms that comply with the requirements of law. (3)\n\nThe proposed judgments shall\nbe numbered in the order in which they are received and submitted in sequence\nto the judge or referee. (4)\n\nUnless the court otherwise directs, the proof required by statute must be in writing, by affidavits, which shall\ninclude a sufficient factual statement to establish jurisdiction, as well as\nall elements of the cause of action warranting the relief sought. (5)\n\nIf the judge or referee\nbelieves that the papers are insufficient, the complaint shall either be\ndismissed for failure of proof or a hearing shall be directed to determine\nwhether sufficient evidence exists to support the cause of action. (6)\n\nWhether upon written proof\nor at the conclusion of a hearing, the judge or referee shall render a decision\nand sign the findings of fact, conclusions of law and the judgment, unless for\nreasons stated on the record decision is reserved. (7)\n\nWhere a hearing has been\nheld, no transcript of testimony shall be required as a condition precedent to\nthe signing of the judgment, unless the judge or referee presiding shall so\ndirect.
