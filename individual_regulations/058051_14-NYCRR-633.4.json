(1)\n\nNo person shall be deprived of any civil\nor legal right solely because of a diagnosis of developmental disability (see\nglossary, section\n633.99\nof this Part). (2)\n\nAll persons shall be given the respect\nand dignity that is extended to others regardless of race; religion; national\norigin; creed; age; sex assigned at birth; gender identity or expression; ethnic background; sexual orientation (including perceived sexual orientation); developmental or other disability; or health condition, such as one tested for\nor diagnosed as having an HIV infection. In addition, there shall be no\ndiscrimination for these or any other reasons. (3)\n\nThe rights set forth in this section are\nintended to establish the living and/or program environment that protects\nindividuals and contributes to providing an environment in keeping with the\ncommunity at large, to the extent possible, given the degree of the\ndisabilities of those individuals. Rights that are self-initiated or involve\nprivacy or sexuality issues may need to be adapted to meet the need of certain\npersons with the most severe disabilities and/or individuals whose need for\nprotection, safety and health care must justify such adaptation. It is the\nresponsibility of the agency/facility or the sponsoring agency to ensure that\nindividuals' rights are not arbitrarily denied. Rights limitations must be\ndocumented and must be on an individual basis, for a specific period of time, and for clinical purposes only. (\nNote: See section\n636-1.4\nof this Title for\ndocumentation requirements specific to the person-centered service plan and\nsection\n633.16\nof this Part for\ndocumentation requirements concerning person-centered behavioral\nintervention.)\n(4)\n\nNo person shall\nbe denied: (i) a safe and sanitary\nenvironment; (ii)\nfreedom from\nphysical or psychological abuse; (iii)\nfreedom from corporal punishment (see\nglossary); (iv)\nfreedom from\nunnecessary use of mechanical restraining devices; (v) freedom from unnecessary or excessive\nmedication; (vi)\nprotection from\ncommercial or other exploitation; (vii)\nconfidentiality with regard to all\ninformation contained in the person's record, and access to such information, subject to the provisions of article 33 of the Mental Hygiene Law and the\ncommissioner's regulations.

(5)\n\nImplementation of many of the above\nrights entails inherent risks. To the extent reasonable, foreseeable and\nappropriate under the circumstances, such risks shall be described to\nindividuals and/or their parents, guardians or correspondents. However, these\nindividuals assume responsibility for those risks typically associated with\nparticipation in normal activities, to the extent the person's abilities permit\nsuch participation.

Such information shall be conveyed in the individual's and/or\nthe parent's, guardian's, or correspondent's primary language if necessary to\nfacilitate comprehension. There shall be agency/facility or sponsoring agency\npolicies/procedures to implement this process as well as the process whereby\nindividuals can be made aware of and understand, to the extent possible, the\nrights to which they are entitled, how such rights may be exercised and the\nobligations incurred upon admission to and participation in the programs\noffered by the facility. (Note: Also see paragraph of this section.)\n(9)\n\nAn individual or their parent(s), guardian(s) or correspondent may object to the application, adaptation or\ndenial of any of the previously stated rights made on [his or her]their behalf\nin accordance with section\n633.12\nof this Part\n(10)\n\nPursuant to section\n33.16\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law, and subject to the limitations contained therein, a\nperson (see glossary, subdivision), or other qualified party (see glossary, 633.99), may make a written request for access to the individual's clinical\nrecord.

(e) The non-English speaking person's adult\nfamily member, significant other, correspondent, or advocate may serve as an\ninterpreter for the person if they and [his/her]their family member, significant other, correspondent or advocate agree to the arrangement, the\narrangement is deemed clinically appropriate, and the parties have been\ninformed of the option of using an alternative interpreter identified by the\nprovider. Providers shall not condition service delivery on the use of family\nmembers or significant others as interpreters.
