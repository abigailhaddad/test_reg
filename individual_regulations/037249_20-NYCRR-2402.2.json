  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2402.2 - Electronic record retention\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. (1)\n\nElectronic\nmeans any technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar\ncapabilities. (2)\n(i) Electronic record\nmeans\ninformation evidencing any act, transaction, occurrence, event, or other\nactivity that is produced or stored by electronic means and that is capable of\nbeing accurately reproduced in a form that is perceptible by human sensory\ncapabilities. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of\nthis Part: (a) the term\nrecord\nor\nrecords\npertain only to those\nmatters that are under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance; and\n(b) the term\ntaxpayer\nincludes every person under such jurisdiction that is\nrequired to retain records, whether or not the person is required to pay\ntax. (b) General. (1)\n\nElectronic records meeting the\nrequirements of this Part have the same force and effect as those taxpayer\nrecords that are produced or retained by nonelectronic means and will be\ntreated by the Department of Taxation and Finance with the same degree of\nconfidentiality as that accorded any other records of the taxpayer. (2)\n\nFor purposes of the Tax Law, any other\nmatter under the jurisdiction of the commissioner, and this Title, any record\nthat a taxpayer is required to retain in its original form or as a duplicate\noriginal, actual reproduction, exact copy, true copy, or the like, will be\nconsidered retained in such form if the electronic version accurately reflects\nthe required information and is accessible to the department, as provided in\nsubdivision (c) of this section. (c) Retaining electronic\nrecords. (1)\nA taxpayer must retain\nelectronic records that accurately reflect the information that is required to\nbe set forth in the records. The electronic records, either alone or in\nconjunction with the taxpayer's other records, must contain sufficient\ninformation in order to support and verify all of the entries that are made on\nthe taxpayer's tax returns or informational reports, and to determine the\nproper taxes or other amounts that may be due. These records, either alone or\ntogether, must be reconcilable to the taxpayer's reporting periods and must\ncreate an audit trail designed so that the details underlying each of the\nentries made on the taxpayer's returns or reports can be identified and made\navailable to the department upon its request. (2)\n\nElectronic records must be dated, legible\n(\ne.g., if the record is scanned), and maintained and preserved\nin such a manner so as to disclose upon retrieval, in readily accessible and\nverifiable detail, the basis for and accuracy of the information reported (or\nrequired to be reported) to the department. The electronic records should also\nbe maintained in a secure storage environment. Failure to maintain adequate\nrecords, or make them available to the department for review, does not relieve\na taxpayer of its obligations under the Tax Law, any other matter under the\njurisdiction of the commissioner, or this Title. Nor is the taxpayer relieved\nof these obligations if it uses a third party to maintain its records, such as\na records management service. (See, however, section\n2392.1\n[d][2]\nof this Title concerning reasonable cause for\nthe cancellation of penalties and other additions to tax because of the\ndestruction of records by a fire or other documented casualty.)\n(3)\n\nElectronic records should be backed up\nregularly, and the backup records should be kept, if possible, at an off-site\nstorage location. In addition, electronic records should be tested periodically\nto confirm their accuracy and integrity. (4)\n\nElectronic records must be accessible to\nthe department for the entire periods for which the records are required to be\nretained. Accordingly, a taxpayer that elects to produce or store any\ninformation by electronic means that evidences any act, transaction, occurrence, event, or other activity (or any portion thereof) must retain and\nmake such electronic records available to the department. For example, if a\ntaxpayer elects to effect a transaction or capture information relating thereto\nby electronic means, the taxpayer must keep the electronic record and make it\navailable to the department upon its request. Generally, records must be\nretained for as long as their contents are material to any period open or\nextended pursuant to statute, or in any action or proceeding pending before the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, or in any judicial action or\nproceeding. (5)\n\nThe department will\nnot prescribe the specific technology or technical specifications applicable to\nretaining or otherwise managing electronic records. Nor will the department\nrequire the use of a particular type of hardware or software. However, a\ntaxpayer must provide the department upon its request with opportunity and, if\nnecessary, the means to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the taxpayer's\nelectronic records. Such means may include, but are not limited to, suitable\nfacilities and computer resources (\ne.g., appropriate hardware\nand software, terminal access, computer time, personnel, etc.) as may be\nnecessary for the department to carry out its audit procedures. See article 41\nof the Tax Law (Taxpayers' Bill of Rights) concerning the rights of a taxpayer\nand the obligations of the department during an audit. (d) Documentation. (1)\nA taxpayer must maintain, and make\navailable to the department if requested, documentation that explains: (i) the specific technologies, technical\nspecifications, and procedures that are used by the taxpayer to retain and\notherwise manage its electronic records; and\n(ii)\nhow these technologies, specifications, and procedures ensure the accuracy and integrity of the taxpayer's electronic\nrecords, as well as satisfy the requirements of this section that the\nelectronic records contain sufficient information to support and verify the\nentries made on the taxpayer's returns and to determine the correct tax\nliabilities, if any. Provided however, the department will not request a\ntaxpayer to furnish information pertaining to the specifications or functions\nof any hardware or software unless such hardware or software was designed and\ndeveloped by the taxpayer, or to the requirements of the taxpayer, or unless\nthe department is not otherwise familiar with the taxpayer's hardware or\nsoftware. For example, a taxpayer who purchases a typical personal computer and\nwho uses a commercially available software package to manage his or her\nfinancial records, in support of personal income tax returns, would not be\nrequired to maintain documentation concerning the specifications or functions\nof such hardware or software. (2)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, the documentation must indicate: (i) the functions being performed as they\nrelate to retaining and otherwise managing the taxpayer's electronic records\n(\ne.g., creating, storing, classifying, modifying, encrypting, authenticating, tracking, generating, communicating, disposing, etc.); (ii)\nthe procedures employed\nduring each of these functions; (iii)\nthe internal controls used to ensure\nthe accuracy and reliability of each of these functions; (iv)\nthe internal controls used to prevent\nthe unauthorized access to the taxpayer's electronic records, including\nunauthorized additions to, alterations of, and deletions of, such\nrecords; (v) the internal controls\n(or other plans) used to protect against the loss of retained records, such as\nin the case of hardware failures, power interruptions, or natural\ndisasters; (vi)\nthe taxpayer's\nchart of accounts (for all periods requested by the department), including\ndetailed account descriptions and file formats; and\n(vii)\nany other taxpayer records that are\nretained electronically, including detailed descriptions of the contents and\nfile formats of such records. (3)\n\nThe documentation must also include the\nnature of and reasons for any changes to the taxpayer's electronic\nrecordkeeping technology, technical specifications, or procedures; the dates\nthat such changes were implemented; and, if applicable, the steps taken to\nensure that the records were accurately duplicated.
