(e) Conduct of an administrative disqualification hearing. (1)\n\nThe hearing officer must advise the\naccused individual that he or she may refuse to answer questions during the\nhearing. (2)\n\nThe burden of proving\nthat an accused individual has committed an intentional program violation is on\nthe social services district. (3)\n\nWhen an individual has been convicted in a State or Federal court of a public\nassistance-IPV, and such conviction was based on a plea of guilty, and such\nconviction was based on the same set of facts which will be the subject of the\nadministrative disqualification hearing, and such individual was not advised on\nthe record in the court proceeding of the disqualification provisions of this\n\nPart: (i) neither the conviction itself nor\nthe records of the court proceeding may be used in any manner in the\nadministrative disqualification hearing; and\n(ii)\nthe existence of the court proceeding\nmay not be disclosed in any manner to the hearing officer by the office or\nsocial services district nor by any person acting on behalf of the office or\nsocial services district nor by any witness presented by any social services\nofficial. (4)\n\nAll\nprovisions in Part 358 of this Title concerning the conduct of fair hearings\nwhich are not inconsistent with any of the specific provisions of this section\nare applicable to administrative disqualification hearings. (f) Decision after an\nadministrative disqualification hearing. (1)\n\nThe decision after an administrative disqualification hearing must be based\nexclusively on clear and convincing evidence and other material introduced at\nthe hearing which demonstrates that an individual committed and intended to\ncommit one or more intentional program violations. (2)\n\nThe decision after an administrative\ndisqualification hearing must specify the reasons for the decision, identify\nthe supporting evidence, identify the pertinent statutes or regulations and\nrespond to reasoned arguments made by the individual or his or her\nrepresentative. (3)\n\nThe department\nmust conduct the hearing, arrive at a decision and forward the decision to the\nsocial services district for implementing action within 90 days of the date of\nthe notice of administrative disqualification hearing. In the event of a\nclient-requested adjournment, this time limit will be extended by the number of\ndays the hearing was postponed. (g) Default of an administrative\ndisqualification hearing. (1)\n\nIf an accused\nindividual cannot be located or fails to appear at an administrative\ndisqualification hearing scheduled pursuant to this Part, the opportunity to\nappear at the hearing may be considered to be defaulted by such individual\nexcept as follows: (i) the individual contacts\nthe department within 30 days after the date of the hearing decision and claims\ngood cause for failure to appear based on nonreceipt of the notice of\nadministrative disqualification hearing or the notice of administrative\ndisqualification hearing was returned as undeliverable. In such situations, a\nhearing will be scheduled at which the commissioner or the commissioner's\ndesignee will determine whether the individual had good cause for failing to\nappear at the administrative disqualification hearing. Good cause for failing\nto appear based on nonreceipt of the notice of administrative disqualification\nhearing will be deemed to exist when the individual establishes at the hearing\nthat the failure to receive the notice of administrative disqualification\nhearing was not caused by the individual. If good cause for failing to appear\nis not established, the hearing decision will remain valid. If good cause is\nestablished, the recipient and the agency will have an opportunity to present\nany evidence or testimony concerning the agency's allegation that the recipient\ncommitted an intentional program violation. After consideration of such\nevidence and/or testimony, the prior hearing decision will be vacated and a new\nhearing decision will be issued; the hearing officer who originally presided at\nthe hearing may conduct the new hearing; or\n(ii)\nthe individual contacts the department\nwithin 10 days after the date of the scheduled hearing and claims good cause\nfor failing to appear. In such a case, a hearing will be scheduled at which the\ncommissioner or the commissioner's designee will determine whether the\nrecipient had good cause for failing to appear at the administrative\ndisqualification hearing. If good cause for failing to appear is not\nestablished, the hearing decision will remain valid. If good cause is\nestablished, the recipient and the agency will have an opportunity to present\nany evidence or testimony concerning the agency's allegation that the recipient\ncommitted an intentional program violation. After consideration of such\nevidence and/or testimony, the prior hearing decision will be vacated and a new\nhearing decision will be issued; the hearing officer who originally presided at\nthe hearing may conduct the new hearing. (2)\n\nIf the opportunity to appear at a hearing\nhas been defaulted by the accused individual in accordance with paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision, the hearing must be conducted without the accused\nindividual being present. Even though the accused individual is not present, the hearing officer is required to consider the evidence carefully and\ndetermine if an intentional program violation was committed based on clear and\nconvincing evidence. (h) Access to record of proceedings. The transcript or recording of testimony, exhibits, or other official reports introduced at the hearing, together with\nall papers and requests filed in the proceeding, and the original or a true\ncopy of the decision after an administrative disqualification hearing must be\nmade available to the individual or to the individual's representative at a\nreasonable time and place. (i) Review of disqualification hearing decisions. A decision that an intentional\nprogram violation has been committed cannot be reversed by a subsequent fair\nhearing held pursuant to Part 358 of this Title. However, the disqualified\nindividual is entitled to seek relief in a court having appropriate\njurisdiction pursuant to article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. The\nperiod of disqualification may be subject to stay or other injunctive remedy\nordered by such a court, but any period for which sanctions are imposed shall\nremain in effect, without possibility of administrative stay, unless and until\nthe finding upon which the sanctions were imposed is subsequently reversed by a\ncourt of appropriate jurisdiction.
