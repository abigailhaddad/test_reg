  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 101.4 - Standards and practices applicable to the construction and environmental management of subsurface electric facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section consists of standards and\npractices which the utilities are expected to follow, to minimize adverse\nenvironmental impacts associated with the construction of subsurface electric\nfacilities under Parts 98, 99 and 100 of this Title. In this section, any\nreference to subsurface electric facilities does not include poles and\nanchors. (b) The standards and\npractices contained in this Part are not intended to supersede the jurisdiction\nof any Federal, State or municipal agency that has permitting or other\nregulatory requirements intended to protect environmental resources or values\nwhich may be adversely affected by the installation of subsurface electric\nfacilities. To accomplish the objectives set forth in this section, each\nutility shall stay in contact with directly affected landowners and\ngovernmental agencies having jurisdiction. (c) Each utility shall use its best efforts\nto avoid or minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, any adverse\nenvironmental effects associated with the construction (including clearing and\nsite-restoration activities) of subsurface electric facilities by: (1)\nlimiting clearing of trees, shrubs and\nlandscaped areas in accordance with safe construction, operating and\nmaintenance practices; (2)\nminimizing off R/W impacts by confining construction activities and access to\nthe smallest areas possible consistent with safe and efficient construction and\noperation practices; (3)\nscheduling\nconstruction for those times that would minimize damage or disruption to\nsensitive resources, and agricultural production activities (except as\notherwise agreed to by the landowner); (4)\nminimizing disturbances to sensitive\nresources such as streams, wetlands or rare, threatened or endangered species\nhabitats by limiting machinery movement in or near such resources during\nconstruction and throughout the life of the facility; (5)\nselecting construction and maintenance\nequipment that minimizes damage to and disruption of soils; (6)\nminimizing topsoil damage and soft\nerosion due to grading and other soft-scarifying activities by promptly\nstabilizing disturbed soil and employing soil separation as appropriate, and\nthereby preventing erosion and siltation and minimizing compaction; and\n(7)\nminimizing traffic\ndisruption when construction vehicles travel along or cross highway R/W by\nproviding appropriate traffic controls. (d) The clearing, construction and site\nrestoration practices set forth in the following provisions shall be observed\nby each utility where applicable: (1)\n\nEach\nutility shall take care to prevent or minimize the grading or piling of soil\noff the R/W, particularly in cultivated land(s) and near streams and\nwetlands. (2)\n\nBefore constructing a\nnew access road, each utility should give preference to using existing access\nto the R/W; however, where steep slopes (over 20 percent) are encountered along\nthe R/W or where soils, which would not support construction equipment or would\nresult in extensive rutting or compaction are encountered, the construction of\neither a temporary or permanent off R/W access road shall be considered. However, the placement of permanent access roads in cultivated land shall be\navoided wherever possible, unless such roads are requested or agreed to by the\nlandowner or farm operator. (3)\n\nEach utility shall endeavor to complete stream crossings in the shortest amount\nof time, with the least amount of adverse environmental impact. (4)\n\nWhere necessary, each utility shall\nproperly install temporary drainage and erosion control devices during clearing\nand grading operations, appropriately maintain them during construction and\nincorporate them, where necessary, into final grading operations. (5)\n\nBefore grading and trenching, each\nutility shall make an on-site effort to verify the location of any buried gas\nlines, water lines, sewer lines, drainage tiles or other facilities which may\nbe encountered. All such facilities removed, cut, broken or otherwise damaged\nduring facility construction shall be restored or replaced to at least their\npreexisting condition, unless the affected property owner declines such\nrestoration or replacement or where such facilities would interfere with the\nsafe and efficient operation and maintenance of the subsurface\nfacilities. (6)\n\nAt the project\nplanning stage, before initiating grading or trenching operations in cultivated\nland on land used in agricultural production (as demonstrated by the affected\nfarm operator), each utility shall discuss with such farm operator and the\nappropriate county soil and water conservation district the soil\ncharacteristics of the project area, drainage, irrigation, cultivation and\nother land management installations and practices, flood control, the proposed\ndepth-of-cover above the facility and the appropriateness of topsoil\nsegregation. In such cultivated land, all cable shall be installed with a\nminimum 40 inches of cover. However, the farm operator may require a\ndepth-of-cover greater than 40 inches as a condition of permitting a\nright-of-way across his or her land where necessary to safely accommodate such\npractices and projects. In such cases, where practicable, the depth-of-cover\nshall be included in the easement recorded in the county records office. All\nsuch decisions should take into account the recommended practices and standards\nof the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, as\nnoted in the farm operator's farm conservation plan on file with the county\nsoil and water conservation district. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions\nconcerning depth of cover, facilities located within 15 feet of the edge of the\ntravel way of any private road or within 15 feet of the edge of any public R/W\nshall be buried at a minimum depth of 30 inches. Cable plow installation may be\nused in cultivated land unless the land within the area of construction\ncontains subsurface drain lines. In those cases, open trenching shall be used\nunless the farm operator agrees to cable plow installation. A generic plan and\nprocedure for the repair of drain lines removed, cut, broken or damaged by\neither method of installation shall be developed by the utility with the soil\nconservation service and the New York State Department of Agriculture and\n\nMarkets showing the method(s) for shouldering of the tile drain line repair\ninto the undisturbed trench wall, the support of the repair tile and the\nmaintenance of the drain line's gravity flow. In all cases of removal, cutting, breakage or damage of drain lines during construction by the utility, repairs\nshall be undertaken at the utility's expense. (7)\n\nWhere adverse effects to significant\nplantings such as ornamental shrubs and trees, as well as visual screens, cannot be avoided during construction, such plants shall be carefully removed\nand planted in a temporary location and then be returned as close as possible\nto their original location following backfilling. If such plants must be\nremoved and are destroyed, they shall be replaced with species and varieties as\nclose as possible in height, diameter and grade to those removed. Exceptions\nwould be where such vegetation would interfere with the operation and\nmaintenance of the facility, the construction is done at the request of the\naffected landowner, or where the affected landowner and the utility agree\notherwise. If the affected property has been the subject of Federal, State or\nlocal agency review jurisdiction, the involved Federal, State or local agency\nmust also agree to the extent the resulting disturbance affects a condition of\na previously issued permit or other approval. Transplanting and plant\nreplacement shall be done consistent with established horticultural\npractices. (8)\n\nIn areas where\nlivestock are confined or farm equipment is operating, all trenches which will\nremain open overnight or on nonworking days shall be temporarily fenced or\nbarricaded, unless the trench shoring or sheeting material extends at least 40\ninches above the working surface. Where reasonably determined to be necessary\nby the affected landowner or farm operator, temporary access shall be\nconstructed to permit persons, vehicles and livestock to cross safely from one\nside of the trench to the other. (9)\n\nShould dewatering of the trench become\nnecessary, all water shall be filtered and dissipated through appropriate\nfilter material or discharged onto vegetation or graveled areas, to prevent\nstream siltation, sedimentation and soil erosion. No such water shall be\ndischarged onto cultivated land in the cropping season or directly into\nregulated streams, ponds or wetlands. If cultivated land receives discharges\noutside the cropping season, measures shall be applied to dissipate the water\nto prevent soil erosion. (10)\n\nEngine-powered construction equipment shall be properly muffled and maintained\nto avoid producing excessive noise. Such equipment shall not be permitted to\nidle unnecessarily near noise-sensitive uses. Near such uses, the quietest\nequipment which is readily available to each utility and appropriate for the\ntask shall be employed. If blasting is necessary, explosive charges shall be\ncontrolled to limit the sound pressure level to 127 dB. (11)\n\nWhenever artifacts or relics which\nappear to have historic value are uncovered during construction, work shall be\nstopped immediately at the site of impact and the State Historic Preservation\n\nOffice shall be notified. Work elsewhere may continue. Construction at the\nimpact site shall not be resumed until the State Historic Preservation Office\nor its designated representative determines the significance of the find and, if required, develops a plan to salvage or protect such resource. If prompt\nclarification of the situation by such officials is not forthcoming or if\ncomplications arise, the commission shall be notified immediately. (12)\n\nIn restoring the R/W each utility shall: (i) recycle all waste material or dispose of\nit in accordance with governing rules and regulations; (ii)\ngrade the entire disturbed R/W to\nrestore it to original grade and contour, unless changes made to grade and\ncontour are agreed to by the landowner; (iii)\ncontact the county soil and water\nconservation district for the most appropriate seed mix and application rates\nin the construction area; (iv)\nutilize the most appropriate seed mix and application rate, giving\nconsideration to compatibility with undisturbed areas of the R/W and the\nsurrounding land and consistent with erosion, wildlife and other environmental\nconcerns; (v) determine the\nsite-specific seed mix to be applied in consultation with the affected farm\noperator; (vi)\nby the end of the\nworkweek in which construction commences, apply mulch (and seed, if no further\ndisturbance is planned) on all disturbed sites within 20 feet of all streams\nand wetlands; (vii)\nstabilize all\ncut and fill banks by employing the most appropriate erosion control devices\nand techniques; (viii)\ncomplete\nstream bank restoration as soon as practicable after the stream crossing\ninstallation is completed. If seasonal conditions do not permit final\nrestoration, temporary restoration measures shall be undertaken, with final\nrestoration measures to follow as soon as practicable thereafter; and\n(ix)\nrepair or replace (and leave in a\ncondition equivalent to or better than, the pre-existing) all existing\ninstallations or improvements, for example, lawns, fences, walls, curbs, sidewalks, culverts, mailboxes, gates, tiles, drainage ditches, waterways, and\nponds which are disturbed, damaged or destroyed during construction, unless\nprevious arrangements with landowners or farm operators dictate\notherwise. (e) Each utility shall ensure that the\nconstruction supervisor, who is on the job, appropriately applies the foregoing\nstandards and practices. The supervisor shall also have authority to stop any\nwork that is inconsistent with the intent of this section and to direct\nappropriate remedial action. The supervisor shall obtain a competent\nspecialist's advice on how to deal with any sensitive resources\nencountered. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
