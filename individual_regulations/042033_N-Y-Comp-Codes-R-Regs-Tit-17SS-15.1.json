  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17§ 15.1 - Purpose and authority\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose\nof this Part is to establish such additional procedures as are necessary for\nthe implementation of the State environmental quality review act (SEQR) by the\n\nNew York State Department of Transportation. In accordance with the authority\ncontained in section 8-0113, subdivision 3 of ECL and 6 NYCRR\n617.4, the\nprocedures contained in this Part vary from those contained in 6 NYCRR Part\n617. The purpose of this variance is to allow the department to establish a\nprocedure for SEQR implementation which corresponds with, and is integrated\ninto, procedures for compliance with the National Environmental Policy\n\nAct. (b) Such coordination of\nprocedures is directed by SEQR in section 8-0111 and is consistent with Council\non Environmental Quality regulations implementing the National Environmental\n\nPolicy Act which have an effective date of July 30, 1979 ( 40 CFR\n1500\net\nseq.). (c) The major differences\nbetween this Part and 6 NYCRR Part\n617\nare: (1)\nlead agency determinations are made at an\nearlier time in the SEQR process; and\n(2)\nall actions which are not type II actions\nare processed in the same manner (similar to type I under 6 NYCRR Part\n617\n). (d) These\nregulations are designed to be no less protective of the environment than 6\nNYCRR Part\n617. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 17§\n15.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
