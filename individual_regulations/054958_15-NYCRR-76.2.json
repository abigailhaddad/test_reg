(b) No such license\nshall be issued unless every applicant, officer, partner, manager, shareholder\nor other person signing the application for license, as required, has furnished\nsatisfactory evidence of good character, reputation, fitness and ability to\ncomply satisfactorily with the regulations affecting drivers'\nschools. (c) Except as provided in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, no license will be issued for a drivers'\nschool or a branch thereof: (1)\nif the place\nof business is within 1,500 feet of a building owned or leased by the State or\ncounty in which motor vehicle registrations or licenses to drive motor vehicles\nare issued to the public; (2)\nif\nthe drivers' school is within 1,500 feet of an official New York State road\ntest post in use at the time of the application therefor; nor\n(3)\nif at the time of application for a new\nlicense, it shall appear that during the preceding license period a building\nowned or leased by the State or county in which motor vehicle registrations or\nlicenses to drive motor vehicles are issued to the public or an official New\n\nYork State road test post has been established within 1,500 feet of such\ndrivers' school or branch thereof, the commissioner may upon consideration of\nall of the circumstances, including but not limited to the relative location\nand a reasonable distance, less than 1,500 feet, of such building or road test\npost and the obligations of any lease of the premises occupied by such drivers'\nschool or branch, waive the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision or give such drivers' school, in conjunction with the issuance of\nsuch renewal license, a reasonable time to relocate. (d) No original license will be issued on or\nafter the effective date of this Part for conducting a drivers' school in a\ncity having a population of 250,000 or more unless the place of business is\nlocated in either: (1)\na portion of a\nbuilding; (2)\na store; or\n(3)\nan office devoted exclusively to\nnonresidential use, except if, through no fault of his own, the licensee is\nforced to leave his place of business, he shall have three months to relocate\nat another fixed location and during this interim period he may locate\ntemporarily in quarters which will serve as a place of business upon the\napproval of the commissioner even though such temporary place of business may\nnot conform to the requirements of this Part. If a portion of a building, store\nor office devoted to nonresidential use is required, such facilities must be\nopen to the public for service at definite stated hours. The hours during which\nsuch facilities are open to the public for service must be listed with the\ncommissioner and prominently displayed on the front door or front window of the\ndrivers' school. Such facilities shall be manned by personnel whose names and\naddresses must be on file with the commissioner. If the facilities are shared\nwith another business and are not reasonably free from other visible and/or\naudible activities, there must be a permanent wall or partition separating the\ntwo. The premises must be located in a well lighted, easily accessible\npermanent structure and maintained in a neat, businesslike manner with adequate\nseating space and furniture provided for the use of the students patronizing\nthe school.

A telephone answering service can only be used\nas an adjunct to a school conducting its business at regularly licensed\npremises. In the case of a drivers' school dealing exclusively in motorcycle\ninstruction, the place of business may be in a bona fide motorcycle dealer's\nheadquarters, but not in the repair service area, provided that all other\nprovisions of this Part are complied with. (f) No application, including an application\nfor change of location, will be approved unless the place of business has\nadequate office space, a minimum of 50 square feet.

If any applicant or instructor employed by such applicant\ndoes not possess such 1,000 hours of behind-the-wheel instruction, he may apply\nto the commissioner for a waiver. For schools teaching motorcycle operation\nonly a valid certificate of instructor training issued by the Motorcycle Safety\n\nFoundation, or any other form of instructor training approved by the\ncommissioner, shall be deemed adequate minimal certification for the applicant\nor any instructor employed by the applicant. (j) Licenses are not transferable. (1)\n\nIn the event of any change of ownership\nor interest in a business licensed as a sole proprietorship or partnership\nwhich enlarges or brings new persons into the business, a new application for a\nlicense must be filed immediately.

The commissioner in a proper case may permit continuance of the business by the\ncurrent licensee, pending processing of the application made by the person or\npersons to whom the business or any such license therein is to be transferred. Such application by the transferee of such business or interest therein shall\nbe considered as an original application for license and shall comply with all\nof the provisions of these regulations regarding the application for and\nissuance of an original license. (4)\n\nUpon the issuance of the new license, the\nprior license, together with all instructors' certificates issued thereunder\nwill become void and must be immediately surrendered to the driver's school\nunit in the central office of the Department of Motor Vehicles, Albany, New\n\nYork. With such surrender of license, there shall also be filed a notice on\nform MV-526 signed by the school manager for each and every instructor whose\ncertificate is so voided, setting forth the name, address and certificate\nnumber of such instructor and the total amount of logged time rendered by such\ninstructor in behind-the-wheel instruction for the account of the\nschool. (k) If the\nlicense is lost or destroyed, a duplicate will be issued by the driver's school\nunit in the central office of the Department of Motor Vehicles, Albany, New\n\nYork upon proof of the facts and payment of the fee of $2.

(m) In order to ensure\ncontinuity of licenses, a renewal application must be submitted not more than\n60 days but at least 30 days prior to the date of expiration of the license\nbeing renewed. Failure to file a renewal application within the period\nspecified herein may result in a delay in the issuance of the renewal license, and a period of time in which the applicant would be unlicensed. Applications\nfor renewal of driving school licenses may be submitted for review up to six\nmonths after the expiration of the last license issued. However, no renewal\napplication will be accepted more than six months after the expiration date of\nthe expiring license. A driving school must have a valid license at the time\nthat any services are provided or business is transacted. (n) A license may be surrendered for\ncancellation, or deposited for safekeeping, at the driver's school unit in the\ncentral office of the Department of Motor Vehicles, Albany, New York issuing\nthe license or other location as specified by the commissioner. In all such\ncases the licensee is required to state in writing the reason for such\nsurrender or deposit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
