  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 351.1 - Damage risk criteria; measurement and determination of loss of hearing\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe guide for evaluation of hearing handicap has required\nperiodic revision as new information becomes available. In 1953, a committee of\nconsultants on occupational loss of hearing issued a report to the chairman, setting forth their recommendations as to how occupational loss of hearing\nshould be evaluated. In 1960, a similar committee was appointed to review the\nrules adopted by the board pursuant to the 1953 recommendations. This committee\nsuggested certain changes in measuring of hearing loss and the criteria, which\nwere subsequently adopted. In 1979, the chairman appointed a committee to\nreview the rules and statute. It made recommendations taking into consideration\nthe two previous reports. On the basis of all the reports, new rules were\nadopted effective October 1, 1980. Thereafter, by chapter 415 of the Laws of\n1983, section\n49-hh\nof the Workers' Compensation Law was\nadded to require that the standards adopted by the board shall conform with the\nstandards recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngology accepted by the\n\nAmerican Medical Association. In order to conform to such standards, amendments\nare hereby adopted, effective January 1, 1984, to be applicable to disablements\noccurring on or after such date. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n351.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
