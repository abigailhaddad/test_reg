  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 9770.9 - Notification of defects\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe corporation shall have 15 calendar days after receipt\nof an invoice by the designated payment office to notify the contractor of (a)\ndefects in the delivered goods, property, or services, (b) defects in the\ninvoice, or (c) suspected improprieties of any kind; and the existence of such\ndefects or improprieties shall prevent the commencement of the time period\nspecified in section\n9770.5\nof this Part. When the\ncorporation fails to notify a contractor of such defects or suspected\nimproprieties within 15 calendar days of receiving the invoice, the number of\ndays allowed for payment of the correct proper invoice will be reduced by the\nnumber of days between the 15th day and the day that notification was\ntransmitted to the contractor. If the corporation, in such situations, fails to\nprovide reasonable grounds for its contention that a defect or impropriety\nexists, the date by which contract payment must be made in order for the\ncorporation not be become liable for interest payments shall be calculated from\nthe date of receipt of an invoice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n9770.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
