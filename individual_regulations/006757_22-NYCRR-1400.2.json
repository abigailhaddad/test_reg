Tit. 22 § 1400.2 - Statement of client's rights and responsibilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn attorney shall provide a prospective client with a\nstatement of client's rights and responsibilities in a form prescribed by the\n\nAppellate Divisions, at the initial conference and prior to the signing of a\nwritten retainer agreement. If the attorney is not being paid a fee from the\nclient for the work to be performed on the particular case, the attorney may\ndelete from the statement those provisions dealing with fees. The attorney\nshall obtain a signed acknowledgement of receipt from the client. The statement\nshall contain the following: STATEMENT OF CLIENT'S RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES\nAn attorney is providing you with this document to inform\nyou of what you, as a client, are entitled to by law or by custom. To help\nprevent any misunderstanding between you and the attorney, please read this\ndocument carefully. If you ever have any questions about these rights, or\nabout the way your case is being handled once you retain the attorney, you are\nresponsible to ask your attorney. Your attorney should be readily available to\nrepresent your best interests and to keep you informed about your case. An attorney may not refuse to represent you on the basis\nof race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, age, national origin or\ndisability. You are entitled to an attorney who will be capable of\nhandling your case; show you courtesy and consideration at all times; represent\nyou zealously; and preserve your confidences and secrets that you reveal in the\ncourse of the relationship, to the extent permitted by law. You are responsible\nto communicate honestly, civilly and respectfully with your attorney. If you are hiring an attorney you and your attorney are\nrequired to sign a written retainer agreement which must set forth, in plain\nlanguage, the nature of the relationship and the details of the fee\narrangement. Before you sign the retainer agreement, you are responsible to\nread it and ask the attorney any questions you have before you sign it. At your\nrequest, and before you sign the agreement, you are entitled to have your\nattorney clarify in writing any of its terms, or include additional\nprovisions. You are entitled to fully understand the proposed rates\nand retainer fee before you sign a retainer agreement, as in any other\ncontract. The retainer fee you pay to your attorney, as is written in the\nretainer agreement, may not be enough money to pay for all the time that the\nattorney works on your case. You may refuse to enter into any fee arrangement that you\nfind unsatisfactory. An attorney may not request a fee that is contingent on\nthe securing of a divorce or on the amount of money or property that may be\nobtained. An attorney may not request a retainer fee that is\nnon-refundable. That is, should you discharge the attorney, or should the\nattorney withdraw from the case with court permission, before the retainer has\nbeen used up, the attorney is entitled to be paid commensurate with the work\nperformed on your case and any expenses. The attorney must return to you any\nbalance of the retainer that has not been used. However, the attorney may enter\ninto a minimum fee arrangement with you that provides for the payment of a\nspecific amount below which the fee will not fall based upon the attorney's\nhandling of the case to its conclusion. You are entitled to know the approximate number of\nattorneys and other legal staff members who will be working on your case at any\ngiven time and what you will be charged for the services of each. You are entitled to know in advance how you will be asked\nto pay legal fees and expenses, and how the retainer, if any, will be\nspent. You may be responsible at the beginning of the case or\nbefore or after the trial to contribute to or pay the other party's attorney's\nfees and other costs if the court has ordered you to do so. The other party may be responsible to contribute to or to\npay your attorney's fees, if the court orders the other party to do so. However, if the other party fails to pay the court ordered fee, you are still\nresponsible for the fees owed to your attorney and experts in your case. You are required to pay for court filing fees, process\nservers as well as fees for expert reports, testimony, depositions and/or trial\ntestimony and you may seek reimbursement from the other party. If you engage in conduct which is found to be frivolous\nor meant to intentionally delay the case you could be fined or sanctioned\nand/or responsible for additional fees. At your request, and after your attorney has had a\nreasonable opportunity to investigate your case, you are entitled to be given\nan estimate of approximate future costs of your case. That estimate shall be\nmade in good faith but may be subject to change due to facts and circumstances\nthat develop during your case. There are no guarantees that the cost of your\ncase will be as originally estimated. You are entitled to receive a written, itemized bill on a\nregular basis, at least every 60 days. You are expected to review the itemized bills sent to you\nby your attorney, and to raise any objections or errors in a timely manner in\nwriting. Time spent in discussion or explanation of bills will not be charged\nto you. You are responsible to be honest and truthful in all\ndiscussions with your attorney, and to provide all relevant information and\ndocumentation to enable her or him to competently prepare your case. Attorneys\nand clients must make reasonable efforts to maintain open communication during\nbusiness hours throughout the representation. An attorney may seek to be\nrelieved as your attorney if you are not honest and truthful with her or\nhim. You are entitled to be kept informed of the status of\nyour case, and to be provided with copies of correspondence and documents\nprepared on your behalf or received from the court or your adversary. Your attorney is required to discuss the following with\nyou: a)\nthe automatic orders that are\nin effect once either party files a summons with notice; b)\nthe law that provides for the financial\nsupport of the children, the Child Support Standards Act, if you and the other\nparty have children under the age of twenty-one; and\nc)\nthe law that provides for the financial\nsupport of the parties, the Maintenance Guidelines Statute. You are responsible to be present and on time in court at\nthe time that conferences, oral arguments, hearings and trials are conducted\nunless excused by the Judge or the part rules of the assigned Judge. You are entitled to make the ultimate decision on the\nobjectives to be pursued in your case, and to make the final decision regarding\nthe settlement of your case. Your attorney has the right to send you written\ncommunications if your attorney disagrees with how you want your case\nhandled. Your attorney's written retainer agreement must specify\nunder what circumstances he or she might seek to withdraw as your attorney for\nnonpayment of legal fees. If an action or proceeding is pending, the court may\ngive your attorney a \"charging lien,\" which entitles your attorney to payment\nfor services already rendered at the end of the case out of the proceeds of the\nfinal order or judgment. In some cases your attorney may exercise a \"retaining\nlien\" which, subject to court proceedings, may allow them to keep your file as\nsecurity. You are under no legal obligation to sign a confession of\njudgment or promissory note, or to agree to a lien or mortgage on your home to\npay for legal fees. Your attorney's written retainer agreement must specify\nwhether, and under what circumstances, such security may be requested. In no\nevent may such security interest be obtained by your attorney without prior\ncourt approval and notice to your adversary. An attorney's security interest in\nthe marital residence cannot be foreclosed against you. You are entitled to have your attorney's best efforts\nexerted on your behalf, but no particular results can be guaranteed. If you entrust money with an attorney for an escrow\ndeposit in your case, the attorney must safeguard the escrow in a special bank\naccount. You are entitled to a written escrow agreement, a written receipt, and\na complete record concerning the escrow. When the terms of the escrow agreement\nhave been performed, the attorney must promptly make payment of the escrow to\nall persons who are entitled to it. Once your Judgment of Divorce is signed, if you are\nre-retaining an attorney you must sign a new retainer agreement. If you are expecting your attorney to prepare and file\ndocuments related to the transfer of a house, co-op or lease, that must be\nspecified in the retainer agreement. The signing of an agreement or court order\nthat transfers title does not transfer a co-op apartment or a house. A separate\ndocument must be prepared and filed. In the event of a fee dispute, you may have the right to\nseek arbitration pursuant to Part 137 of the Rules of the Chief Administrative\n\nJudge where the dispute involves a sum of more than $1,000.00 or less than\n$50,000.00 unless you agree otherwise. Your attorney will provide you with the\nnecessary information regarding arbitration in the event of a fee dispute, or\nupon your request.
