  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1901.1 - Criteria for participation in short-term temporary release\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following section contains the criteria for\nparticipation in the three types of short-term temporary release programs, leave of absence, community services programs and furlough. Each program is\nindividually handled. However, it is also necessary to refer to other sections\nin this Part to properly process each individual case. (a) Leave of absence program. Any inmate may\napply for this program, regardless of time criteria, as long as all other\neligibility requirements are satisfied. The point score must, however, be at\nleast 30. A leave of absence lets the inmate leave an institution to visit\nhis/her spouse, child, brother, sister, grandchild, parent (natural or legally\nadoptive), grandparent or ancestral aunt or uncle during his or her last\nillness if death appears to be imminent; to attend the funeral of such\nindividual, or to undergo surgery or to receive medical or dental treatment not\navailable in a correctional institution only if deemed absolutely necessary to\nthe health and well-being of the inmate and where approval is granted by the\ncommissioner or his designee. A temporary release committee form 4188 must be\ncompleted and signed by the facility health services director in the last\ninstance. (1)\n\nDeathbed/funeral visit. One\ndeathbed visit may be granted for each terminally ill relative. If one escorted\nvisit has been previously granted, no leave of absence can be considered. (i) During normal working hours. (a) Upon receipt of the inmate's application, the temporary release committee chairperson shall verify the facts of the case. A leave of absence can be granted to inmates who wish to visit their spouse, child, brother, sister, grandchild, parent (natural or legally adoptive), grandparent or ancestral aunt or uncle only. (For the purposes of this section\nthe term spouse includes a person who is the same sex as the inmate, if the\nsame-sex marriage was performed in New York State or if a same sex marriage or\ncivil union was performed in any other jurisdiction that authorizes such\nmarriage or union. Counsel's office may be consulted to determine whether the\noutside jurisdiction does authorize same-sex marriages or civil unions.) For a\ndeathbed visit, it is necessary that the temporary release committee\nchairperson contact the patient's doctor or a hospital administrator directly\nin order to verify the patient's medical condition and to ascertain if death is\nimminent. The chairperson must also verify the name, address and telephone\nnumber of the hospital and attending physician along with any other facts\nnecessary to consider this case. (b) For a funeral visit, it is necessary that\nthe temporary release committee chairperson contact the funeral home director\nto verify the death and to ascertain the dates, times and addresses of the\nwake, funeral and interment. (c) The temporary release committee then meets to render a decision. If approved by\nthe temporary release committee, the superintendent's approval is then\nrequired. Central office review cases will need the required approval as\noutlined in section\n1900.4\n(n) of this Title. (d) The inmate will\nbe granted only the length of time necessary to accomplish the purpose of the\nleave. (e) Only with the\ncommissioner's approval will out-of-state leaves of absence be allowed, and\nonly for deathbed or funeral visits only for those relatives listed in\nsubdivision (a) of this section. (ii)\n\nWeekends or nights. If the temporary\nrelease committee chairperson or the temporary release interviewer are not\navailable, the superintendent, acting superintendent, or officer of the day\nshould be contacted directly. The superintendent of such facility alone will\ndecide on those cases which do not require central office review, whether to\nlet the inmate go out and whether the inmate will be escorted or unescorted. He\nmay use whatever information he has available in making a decision, including\nthe point system. However, central office review cases will need the required\napproval as outlined in section\n1900.4\n(n) of this Title. (2)\n\nMedical/dental. A leave of absence for this purpose will be granted only for\nsurgery or to receive medical treatment not available in a correctional\ninstitution only if deemed absolutely necessary to the health and well-being of\nthe inmate and where approval is granted by the commissioner or his designee. (i) All inmates applying for a leave of\nabsence for the purposes of obtaining dental or medical treatment must be\nwilling to obtain such treatment within the county where the facility is\nlocated or in a city or town located within 30 miles of the facility. (ii)\n\nUpon request of an inmate who is\napproved for dental or medical leave, a list of three dentists or doctors will\nbe provided to him from which to choose in those cases where the inmate does\nnot have his own dentist or doctor within the radius or area as stated in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nIf the specific type of treatment\nrequired is not available in the nearby area, the facility medical officer\nshall report in writing that required treatment is not available nearby. The\nreport must also specifically state the area in which treatment can be obtained\nby the inmate. (iv)\n\nAll medical or\ndental leaves of absence more than one day in duration, even when not a central\noffice review case, must be approved by the director of temporary release\nprograms. (v) The following steps\nmust be followed by temporary release committee chairpersons prior to an inmate\nbeing granted a leave of absence for the purposes of obtaining dental or\nmedical treatment in the community: (a) Obtain a temporary release committee form 4188 completed and signed by the\nfacilty health services director. (b) Obtain a detailed treatment plan that\ndelineates the expected number of visits required to accomplish the objective\nand specific treatment to be provided during each visit. (c) Arrange for examination by the facility\ndentist or physician following each visit to the outside practitioner to ensure\nthe treatment has been performed. Leaves of absence on consecutive days should\nnot be granted as a rule, unless it is possible for the facility to make the\nabove-mentioned examinations after each visit. (d) The inmate's bounds of confinement must\nstate that he will proceed directly to the dentist's or physician's office upon\nrelease and return directly to the facility upon completion of the office\nvisits. (e) Ensure that leaves of\nabsence granted for dental or medical treatment are never more than a\nreasonable number of hours within a single day, with the inmate leaving the\nfacility and returning on the same day unless a leave of more than one day is\ndetermined necessary by the facility dentist or medical officer. In such cases\nwhere more than one day is deemed necessary, final approval must be obtained\nfrom the director of temporary release programs. (b) Community services\nprogram (volunteer work). (1)\n\nThe temporary\nrelease statute permits eligible inmates to engage in volunteer work in the\ncommunity for a period not exceeding 14 hours in any day. Such volunteer work\nshould be confined to nonprofit organizations or public agencies (e.g., hospitals, service clubs, special community projects, etc.) that have\nestablished volunteer service programs with a definite job description\noutlining the duties and responsibilities of a volunteer. (2)\n\nInmates should not be used to solicit\nfunds even though a given agency may use volunteers for this program. Under no\ncircumstances is an inmate volunteer to replace a paid employee or otherwise\nfill a position that may be occupied by a paid worker. (3)\n\nVolunteers may receive from their\nsponsors, where appropriate, a uniform, meals, and a modest allowance for\nout-of-pocket expenses with the knowledge and permission of the temporary\nrelease committee chairperson. As a rule, however, participants in a volunteer\nwork program will receive an allowance from facility temporary release program\nappropriations. The allowances will be equivalent to the highest incentive\nallowance granted to an inmate, i.e., grade four, step four (currently $1.15\nplus one dollar which will total $2.15). (4)\n\nAt an institution designated a work\nrelease facility, the work release parole officer will assume responsibility\nfor supervision of the inmate volunteer worker in the community. At all other\nfacilities, arrangements must be made for appropriate parole supervision in the\ncommunity before any volunteer program is approved. (5)\n\nIf there are any questions about the\nlegitimacy of a volunteer program proposal for any inmate, or if assistance is\nrequired to arrange for community supervision, the matter should be referred to\nthe director of temporary release programs. (6)\n\nReligious services participation under\nthis title is permitted for eligible inmates only when the services are not\navailable within the facility. (7)\n\nParticipation in athletic and cultural events is permitted provided those\nevents are not available in the facility. (8)\n\nNo out-of-state community services\nprogram requests will be approved. (c) Furlough program. Furlough program means\na program under which eligible inmates may be granted the privilege of leaving\nthe premises of an institution for a period not exceeding seven days for the\npurpose of maintaining family ties, solving family problems, seeking\npost-release housing, seeking employment, attending a short-term educational or\nvocational training course, or for any matter necessary to the furtherance of\nany such purpose. No out-of-state furloughs will be approved. (1)\n\nTypes of furlough. (i) One-day furlough. A one-day furlough\nallows the inmate to leave the institution for up to 14 hours in any 24-hour\nperiod for the purposes listed in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nExtended furlough. An extended furlough\nis a furlough for more than one day, not exceeding seven days for the purposes\nlisted in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nFurlough purpose. Furloughs may be\ngranted for only the following purposes: (i) Family-tie furlough. A family-tie furlough is for the purpose of maintaining\nfamily ties and/or solving family problems. (a) An approved residence is required for a\none-day or an extended family tie furlough. The residence must be one of the\nfollowing: (1)\nblood relative; (2)\nverifiable guardian; (3)\nspouse (see clause [a][1][(i][a] of this\nsection for the scope of the term); (4)\ncommon law spouse where the relationship\nhad existed for more than one year before incarceration. (b) For an inmate whose family resides\nout-of-state, the inmate may request facility temporary release committee and\ncentral office approval of a transient location (motel, hotel, private home, etc.) within the State of New York. (c) Where inmates from different facilities\nrequest furloughs at the same time to the same residence based upon their\nfamiliar relationships, the superintendent of both facilities must consent to\nsimultaneous furloughs. The temporary release committee chairperson is\nresponsible to inquire of the inmate to be furloughed whether any family member\nor anyone else will be furloughed to that address simultaneously. (ii)\n\nJob-search furlough. A\njob-search furlough is for the purpose of seeking employment to prepare for the\ninmate's release to the community. (a) There\nis no residence requirement for a one-day job-search furlough. (b) For an extended job-search furlough, an\ninmate may be allowed to furlough to an approved residence listed in clause\n(i)(a) of this paragraph or, if such approved residence is not available, may\ninstead be allowed to furlough to a legal and verifiable residence provided, however, that such residence is not also a publicly funded premises utilized\nfor members of the general public requiring temporary housing. (iii)\n\nPost-release housing\nfurlough. A post-release housing furlough is for the purpose of seeking housing\nto prepare for the inmate's return to the community. (a) There is no residence requirement for a\none-day furlough. (b) For an\nextended post-release housing search furlough, the imate may be allowed to\nfurlough to an approved residence listed in clause (i)(a) of this paragraph, or\nif such approved residence is not available, may instead be allowed to furlough\nto a legal and verifiable residence, provided, however, that such residence is\nnot also a publicly funded premises utilized for members of the general public\nrequiring temporary housing. (iv)\n\nShort-term educational/vocational\ntraining course furlough. A short-term educational/vocational training course\nfurlough includes both a rehabilitation therapy furlough for the purpose of\nattending a rehabilitation therapy program and educational/vocational furlough\nfor the purpose of attending a short-term noncontinuous educational\ncourse/program. (a) Rehabilitation therapy\nfurlough. Such a furlough is for the purpose of permitting an inmate to attend\nan outside alcohol/substance abuse therapy program, Gambler's Anonymous or for\nany matter necessary to the furtherance of any such purposes. (1)\nA rehabilitation therapy furlough is a\none-day furlough only. There is no extended furlough. (2)\n\nThere is no residence\nrequirement. (b) Education furlough. Such a furlough could be for the purpose of taking an\nexamination for entrance to an education institution, attending an education\nconference, short course or seminar. (1)\n\nEducational furlough purpose and residence require central office\napproval. (2)\n\nAn educational\nfurlough may be a one-day or an extended furlough final approval will be made\nby central office. (3)\n\nFurlough\ntiming guidelines. (i) Application timing. See\nsection\n1900.4\n(c)(9)\nof this Title. (ii)\n\nHoliday\nscheduling. Due to the increase in holiday applications, the director of\ntemporary release programs shall promulgate a schedule which will require\ninmates to submit applications for furlough during holiday periods, specifically Christmas and Thanksgiving, at dates sufficiently in advance of\neach holiday to allow for completion of the process as described in the rules\nand regulations, and in sufficient time to notify the inmates of the decisions\nprior to such holiday. This procedure may require that some furlough\napplications be approved well before the effective date of furlough. (iii)\n\nFurlough timing. All general\nconfinement inmates must meet the following timing requirements: (a) No inmate may take: (1)\nmore than 28 days in any furlough\nyear; (2)\nmore than 14 days in the\nfirst six months of any furlough year; (3)\nmore than 7 days in any 28-day period; or\n(4)\na furlough longer than seven\ndays. (b) The furlough\nyear begins on the date an inmate takes his first furlough and ends 365/366\ndays thereafter. (c) Furlough\ntiming does not apply to short educational/vocational training course furloughs\nor job-search furloughs with the exception of subclause (a)(4) of this\nsubparagraph. (d) Approval\ncontingencies. (1)\n\nAll furlough approvals\nmade by the temporary release committee for nonstatutory cases and by central\noffice for special review and statutory cases shall be considered continuous, unless otherwise stated in the decision. After the initial furlough, subsequent\nfurlough requests shall be scheduled by the superintendent or his designee and\nneed only be approved as to the qualification of the inmate by the facility\ntemporary release committee unless the case status changes as outlined in this\nsubdivision. Under the situations described in this subdivision, recission is\nmandatory. (2)\n\nApproval to\nparticipate in any type of temporary release program is a conditional approval\nuntil such time as participation has commenced. Approval is contingent upon the\ninmate's continuing good behavior from the time the conditional approval is\ngranted until the time the inmate begins each period of temporary release. The\ninmate will be notified, in writing, of the above conditions at the same time\nhe is notified of an approval. (3)\n\nConditional approval shall be rescinded by a change in the inmate's\ndisciplinary record as indicated by imposition of a penalty at a disciplinary\nhearing or a superintendent's hearing, by a deterioration in the inmate's\nprogram participation or upon receipt of significant and adverse information\nnot available when the inmate was originally approved for temporary release\nparticipation. (4)\n\nIn those cases\nwhere the conditional approval is rescinded the inmate's de novo application\nmay be resubmitted immediately except as noted in section\n1900.4\n(c)(5)\nof this Title. (5)\n\nIf the\nconditional approval is rescinded as noted above, the superintendent must, in\nwriting, notify the inmate and the director of temporary release programs\nclearly stating the reason(s) for rescission. (6)\n\nIn the event that an inmate's eligibility\nfor temporary release as defined in section\n851\nof the Correction Law, changes, subsequent applications for temporary release shall be processed de\nnovo. (7)\n\nAn inmate pending\ntransfer to a work release or educational release program/facility after\ncentral office approval shall be eligible for furlough from the transferring\nfacility. The superintendent and temporary release committee of the\ntransferring facility, with discretion, shall utilize this furlough approval to\nappropriately maintain the efficient and orderly operation of the transferring\nfacility. (8)\n\nApproval by the\ncommissioner for work or educational release shall be deemed to be approval for\nassignment to a work or educational release facility and approval for furlough\nfrom such facility. The superintendent of such facility may, however, at his\ndiscretion elect to postpone furlough as he feels is most appropriate to\nachieve the efficient and orderly operation of such facility. (9)\n\nIf approved for furlough only, the inmate\nis not approved for any other temporary release programs. However, approval for\ncontinuous temporary release programs also implies approval for all other\ntemporary release programs at the discretion of the temporary release committee\nand the facility superintendent.
