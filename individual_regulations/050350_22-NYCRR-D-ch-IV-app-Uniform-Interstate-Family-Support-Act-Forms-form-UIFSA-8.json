Under the Uniform Interstate\n\nFamily Support Act (UIFSA), only the controlling order should be recognized for\nprospective enforcement (i.e., enforcement of current support). This form is\ndesigned to notify other tribunals/agencies when a tribunal makes a\ndetermination of which order is controlling, or when the tribunal issues a new\nchild support order or modifies a child support order. When a new order is\nissued or an order is modified in accordance with UIFSA, the new order (or\nnewly modified order) becomes the controlling order. This notice provides a standard format for\nalerting entities in other jurisdictions about a controlling order\ndetermination. The actual determination will likely be in a State-specific\nformat (e.g., order or form) which may be attached to the standard Notice of\n\nDetermination of Controlling Order if necessary. The Notice of Determination of\n\nControlling Order provides the information about the controlling order in a\nuniform, standard format that will facilitate interstate processing. Complete this notice when your tribunal\nmakes a determination of which order is controlling, or when your tribunal\nissues a new child support order or modifies a child support order. Generally, this form only needs to be used when there are multiple orders governing the\nsame obligor/obligee/child(ren). If multiple orders governing the same\nobligor, obligee, and child(ren) exist, a UIFSA State can only prospectively\nenforce or modify the \"controlling order\" in a UIFSA proceeding. UIFSA contains\nrules for determining which order is recognized when multiple orders exist. Under these rules: 1. The order issued by a tribunal with\ncontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) has priority. As issuing tribunal\nretains CEJ as long as the issuing State remains the residence of the obligor, obligee, or child, or until all parties file written consent with the tribunal\nallowing another State to modify the order. 2. If more than one issuing tribunal would\nhave CEJ, the order issued by the child's current home State has\npriority. 3. If more than one tribunal would have\nCEJ but there is no order in the child's current home State, the most recently\nissued order has priority. 4. If no tribunal would have CEJ, the\nresponding State may issue a new support order and it becomes the CEJ\nState. While only the controlling order should be\nrecognized for prospective enforcement, arrears that accrued under other orders\nmay still be enforced. You must use the Notice of Determination\nof Controlling Order to notify: the initiating IV-D agency if you are\nacting as a responding jurisdiction in an interstate action, any tribunal that has issued, registered, or is enforcing a child support order governing the same parties and\nchild(ren), any IV-D agency with an open or closed\nIV-d case for the parties, a party to the order (i.e., the obligor or\nobligee), as appropriate, or\n____________\nInstructions for Notice of Determination\nof Controlling Order Page 1\na central registry in another State. It\nmay be particularly important to notify a central entity if it keeps a registry\nof all orders in that State. A central registry may also be willing to notify\ntribunals or agencies within that State. HEADING/CAPTION: Enter the date of the notice. Identify the obligor and obligee in the\nappropriate spaces. Check the appropriate space to identify\nthe type of case: IV-D Non Public Assistance; IV-D Non Public Assistance\n\nMedicaid (indicate whether receiving Full Services or Medical Services Only); IV-D Public Assistance; IV-E Foster Care; or Non IV-D.

Public Assistance means the obligee's family receives IV-A cash\npayments [IV-A was formerly called Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AFDC) and is now called Temporary Family Assistance]. A IV-D Non Public\n\nAssistance Medicaid case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid\nbut does not receive Public Assistance (IV-A cash payments).
