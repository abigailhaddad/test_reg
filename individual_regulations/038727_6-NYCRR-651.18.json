  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 651.18 - Payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Installment\npayments of the State grant will be made at the request of the municipality. Payments will be based on the cost of work performed, materials and equipment\nsupplied and incorporated in, and services rendered in connection with an\napproved project. (b) The\ndepartment will retain five percent from each payment except the final\npayment. (c) If the municipality\nfails to comply with any of the requirements of the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw, the State Sanitary Code or regulations of the department applicable to\nwater quality improvement projects, the department may withhold all or part of\nfurther payments pending compliance. (d) Upon notification from the municipality\nthat the project is complete, the department will conduct a final inspection to\ndetermine if the project is operating in accordance with applicable laws and\nregulations. The cost of any work completed after the final inspection, or\nafter a date established by the department at the final inspection, will not be\nconsidered part of the project cost. (e) A final payment, which brings the total\nof State grant payments to 100 percent of the State share of the project cost, will be released upon determination by the department that the project is\ncomplete and is operating satisfactorily, and that all grant requirements have\nbeen met. If the project is complete but not operating satisfactorily, the\ndepartment may withhold from the final payment an amount sufficient, in the\njudgment of the department, to ensure correction of deficiencies. The amount\nwithheld will be released when deficiencies are corrected. (f) Total grant payments may not exceed the\n\nState share of either the estimated reasonable cost or the actual project cost, whichever is lower. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n651.18\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
