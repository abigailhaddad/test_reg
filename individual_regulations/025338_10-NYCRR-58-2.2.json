  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 58-2.2 - Qualifications of donors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The medical director shall be responsible for the determination that blood may be collected safely from a donor and that the donor's blood is acceptable for collection. This determination shall be made by the medical director or trained staff members under the medical director's supervision on the day of collection of the blood. In addition, autogeneic collections prior to anticipated surgery or other medical procedure shall require the written authorization of the donor's health care provider and written consent of the donor. If autogeneic blood is to be subsequently used for allogeneic transfusion, all requirements in subdivision (f) of this section must be met. (b) Only those persons may be accepted as donors of blood for allogeneic use who are in good health as indicated by: (1)\nfreedom from infectious skin lesions at the phlebotomy site and from any infectious skin disease generalized to an extent that creates a risk of contamination of the blood; (2)\nfreedom from any disease transmissible by blood transfusion, insofar as can be determined by history and examinations required in this Subpart; (3)\nfreedom from active tuberculosis. A person with a history of tuberculosis may be accepted as a blood donor following completion of drug therapy; (4)\nfreedom from syphilis. However, blood for plasma fractionation into heat-treated or pathogen-inactivated derivatives may be accepted; (5)\nfreedom from a history of viral hepatitis for a duration specified by the United States Public Health Service; (6)\nfreedom from a history of malaria or travel to or residence in malarially endemic areas for periods of time considered to increase risks for malaria exposure, as determined by the United States Public Health Service. However, plasma for transfusion or fractionation may be accepted from donors with a history of malaria or travel to a malarially endemic area; (7)\nfreedom from signs and symptoms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; and\n(8)\nfreedom from other medical contraindications. (c) For allogeneic collection, a person may not be accepted as a blood donor: (1)\nwhose health may be affected adversely by the bleeding; (2)\nwho has received a transfusion of blood or blood components within the past year, with the exception of autogeneic transfusion; (3)\nwho is under 17 years of age, except that donors who are 16 years of age may be accepted, if they have presented written permission specific to the occasion from a parent or guardian; (4)\nwho is 76 years of age, or older, except that donors who are 76 or older may be accepted at the after satisfactory case-by-case review of the donor by the medical director or his/her designee; (5)\nwho is known to use or presents indications of having used illegal injectable drugs; (6)\nwhose oral temperature exceeds 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit); (7)\nwhose pulse after resting is faster than 110 or slower than 45 beats per minute, except if the donor is an athlete with high exercise tolerance; or whose pulse exhibits pathologic irregularities; (8)\nwhose systolic blood pressure exceeds 180 millimeters of mercury, or whose diastolic pressure exceeds 100 millimeters; (9)\nwhose weight is less than 50 kilograms (110 pounds), except that a donor whose weight is between 40 kilograms (88 pounds) and 50 kilograms (110 pounds) may donate a volume proportionate to the donor's weight, provided that the anticoagulant is proportionately reduced and the container is appropriately labeled; (10)\nwhose hemoglobin content is less than 12.5 grams per deciliter or whose hematocrit is less than 38 percent, as determined by techniques found by the department to meet medical standards generally accepted in New York State; (11)\nwho is known ever to have received pituitary-derived human growth hormone; or\n(12)\nwho falls into a category of individuals determined by the United States Public Health Service to be unsuitable for blood donation. (d) For allogeneic collection: (1)\n\nAll donors shall be given educational materials on risk activities for HIV infection and shall be advised that persons at risk for HIV infection should refrain from donating blood. (2)\n\nEach donor shall be provided the opportunity to indicate confidentially, at the time of donation or after donation, that blood collected may be unsuitable for transfusion. (e) For autogeneic collection only: (1)\n\nThere are no age limits. (2)\n\nThe hemoglobin concentration of the donor-patient should be no less than 11 grams per deciliter, or the hematocrit, if substituted, should be no less than 33 percent, unless otherwise approved in writing by the medical director of the blood bank or other physician designated by such medical director. (3)\n\nThe frequency of phlebotomy for autogeneic transfusion shall be determined by the medical director of the blood bank and the donor-patient's physician. Phlebotomy of the donor-patient within 72 hours of the time of the anticipated surgery or transfusion must be authorized in writing by the medical director or other physician designated by the medical director. (4)\n\nDonation for autogeneic transfusion should not be undertaken if medically contraindicated. (f) Blood withdrawn for autogeneic transfusion may not be used for allogeneic transfusion unless the donor meets all the criteria set forth in subdivision (b), and paragraphs (c)(2), (5) and (6) of this section, and the unit meets the requirements set forth in section\n58-2.3\n(a) of this Subpart. The minimum hemoglobin concentration for such a unit shall be 12.5 grams per 100 milliliters or a hematocrit of 38 percent, and the minimum volume for such a unit shall be 405 milliliters. (g) Blood withdrawn in order to promote the health of a donor otherwise qualified under the provisions of this section shall not be used for transfusion unless the container label indicates the donor's disease that necessitated withdrawal of blood, except that, in the case of a donor with hemochromatosis, blood without such labeling may be used for transfusion, provided that the blood bank has demonstrated that therapeutic phlebotomy is available free of charge to hemochromatosis patients and that all other requirements of this Subpart have been met.
