  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1631-2.3 - Tenant safety\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfostering of an accident conscious climate can aid greatly in the campaign for\nsafety. Proper tenant attitudes tend to minimize the incidence of accidents. Aids which will assist the authority in this aspect of the safety program are\nperiodic announcements and narratives in the project newspaper; the placing of\nnotices and posters in public areas; announcements at tenant meetings and the\ninclusion of notices and announcements with rent receipts. (b) The issue of authority owned equipment, such as hand lawn mowers, garden tools, etc., for use in tenant maintenance\nimposes a possible liability on the authority in the event of personal injury\nresulting from such use. Consequently, such equipment should be loaned only to\nmembers of tenants' households who are physically and mentally capable of using\nsuch equipment. (c) Power mowers, electric tools and other equipment considered hazardous will not be issued for\ntenants' use. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1631-2.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
