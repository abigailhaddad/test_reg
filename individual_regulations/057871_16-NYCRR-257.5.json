  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 257.5 - Piping systems and components\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pipe\nlabeling. All plant piping shall be identified by color coding, printing or\nlabeling. \"Scheme for the Identification of Piping Systems, ANSI/ASME A13.1\"\n(as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), or any\nexisting corporation system may be used. (b) Welding and welding inspection. (1)\n\nNotwithstanding NFPA 59, the quality of\n100 percent if practical but not less than 90 percent of the shop and field\nwelds in all piping two inches in nominal diameter or greater carrying LPG, flammable liquids, or flammable gas shall be nondestructively tested. Welds\nmust meet requirements of API Standard 1104 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title) except for\nsubsection 9.3.11 for undercutting to the root bead. Such undercutting shall\nnot exceed two inches in length, or one sixth of the length of the weld, whichever is smaller. Nondestructive inspection may consist of radiographic\nexamination, magnetic particle testing or ultrasonic. Other methods of\nnondestructive inspection may be used with prior approval of the\ndepartment. (2)\n\nWhen pipe carrying\nLPG, flammable liquids, or flammable gas has a nominal diameter of less than\ntwo inches, or when the construction project involves such a limited number of\nwelds that nondestructive inspection would be impractical and the pipe is\nintended to operate at 20 percent or less of the specified minimum yield\nstrength, then paragraph (1) of this subdivision is not mandatory, provided the\nwelding is inspected visually and approved by a person qualified to inspect\nwelding. (3)\n\nIn addition to the\nnondestructive inspection requirements outlined in this subdivision, there\nshall be continual control of the quality of welding by qualified\npersonnel. (4)\n\nEach gas corporation\nconstructing an LPG facility shall have written welding procedures and welder\ntesting procedures for field welding conforming to API Standard 1104 (as\ndescribed in section\n10.3\nof this Title). All welders\nemployed to make welds shall be qualified under the welder testing\nprocedure. (c) Pressure\ntesting. (1)\n\nPiping with a maximum operating\npressure up to 100 PSIG shall be tested with a calibrated indicating or\nrecording gauge that will indicate two PSIG increments or less, at 150 percent\nof the maximum operating pressure, or 90 PSIG, whichever is greater. The test\nmust be conducted by maintaining the pressure at or above the test pressure for\nat least one hour after stabilization. The test medium shall be air, inert gas\nor water. (2)\n\nPiping with a maximum\noperating pressure 100 PSIG and higher shall be tested with a calibrated\nrecording pressure gauge that will indicate increments of five PSIG or less and\nshall be attached to the test section. The gauge must be calibrated hourly. Calibration is against a dead-weight tester, or equivalent device, attached to\nthe test section. The test pressure shall be at least equal to 90 percent of\nSMYS or 1.5 times the maximum allowable operating pressure, whichever is less. The strength test must be conducted by maintaining the pressure at or above the\ntest pressure for at least four hours after stabilization. The test medium\nshall be air, inert gas, or water unless the maximum operating pressure is in\nexcess of 20 percent SMYS in which case the test medium must be\nwater. (3)\n\nDue consideration and\ncare shall be observed due to effects of changes in ambient and test medium\ntemperature in the case of above-ground or exposed piping. (4)\n\nIf a component other than pipe is the\nonly item being replaced or added to a pipeline, a strength test after\ninstallation is not required, provided the manufacturer of the component\ncertifies that: (i) the component was tested\nto at least the pressure required for the pipeline to which it is being\nadded; (ii)\nthe component was\nmanufactured under a quality control system that ensures that each item\nmanufactured is at least equal in strength to a prototype and that the\nprototype was tested to at least the pressure required for the pipeline to\nwhich it is being added; or\n(iii)\nthe component carries a pressure rating established through applicable\nASME/ANSI, MSS specifications (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title) or by unit\nstrength calculations as described in section\n255.143\nof this Title. (d) Valve operators. Powered operators shall be provided on emergency shut-off valves eight inches\nand larger in size. Means for manual operation shall also be\nprovided. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n257.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
