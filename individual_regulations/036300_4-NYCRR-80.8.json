  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 80.8 - Prevention of invasions of privacy\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of subdivision two of\nsection\n89\nof the\n\nPublic Officers Law and in conformity with such guidelines as may be\npromulgated by the Committee on Public Access to Records regarding the\nprevention of unwarranted invasions of personal privacy, the records access\nofficer may delete from any record identifying details the disclosure of which\nwould result in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy prior to making\nsuch record available for inspection and/or copying. In the event that one or\nmore deletion is so made from any document, the records access officer shall\nprovide written notice of that fact to the person given access to the record. If the record is such that the personal matters cannot be fully deleted without\nsubstantively affecting the record or the identifying details cannot be\neffectively deleted, the records access officer shall deny access to such\nrecord as provided in section\n80.9\nof this\n\nPart.
