Unreasonable lateness by\nthe appellant will be deemed as nonappearance. (2)\n\nRespondent. If the respondent fails to\nappear, or is late, he/she will be deemed to have submitted on the\nrecord. (e) Hearing\nprocedures. In the conduct of hearings, the board shall not be bound by the\ntechnical or formal rules of procedure or evidence. It may proceed in such\nmanner and order as it deems best to protect the rights of all parties. Parties\npresenting oral arguments shall be subject to such restrictions as to form, subject matter and time as the board, or the presiding member designated by the\nboard to hear the appeal, may require.
