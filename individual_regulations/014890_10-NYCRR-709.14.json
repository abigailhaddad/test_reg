  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 709.14 - Cardiac services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) These\nstandards will be used to evaluate certificate of need applications for cardiac\ncatheterization laboratory center services and cardiac surgery center services. It is the intent of the Public Health and Health Planning Council that these\nstandards, when used in conjunction with the planning standards and criteria\nset forth in section\n709.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of planning principles and decision-making tools for directing the\ndistribution of cardiac catheterization laboratory center services and cardiac\nsurgery center services. These planning principles and decision-making tools\nbuild on the existing regional resources that have been developed through the\nregulatory planning process. The goals and objectives of the standards\nexpressed herein are expected to promote access to cardiac catheterization\nlaboratory center services and cardiac surgery center services, and maintain\nprovider and operator volumes associated with high quality care, and avoid the\nunnecessary duplication of resources while addressing the geographic\ndistribution of services necessary to meet the needs of patients in need of\nemergency percutaneous coronary interventional (PCI) procedures. Additionally, it is intended that the methodology provide sufficient flexibility to consider\nadditional circumstances that reflect on the need for cardiac services, including providing flexibility for regional health systems to provide cardiac\nservices at sites that are convenient to patients in the communities they\nserve. (b) Cardiac surgery centers. The factors for determining the public need for cardiac surgery center services\nshall include, but not be limited to the following: (1)\n\nThe planning area for determining the\npublic need for cardiac surgery center services shall include the applicant's\ndesignated health systems agency (HSA) region and the use area of the applicant\nfacility. For purposes of determining cardiac surgery center services need, the\nuse area of a facility is defined as the area within a 100 mile radius of the\napplicant facility. (2)\n\nPlanning\nfor cardiac surgery center services shall ensure that, to the extent possible, eighty percent of the total population of each HSA region resides within 100\nmiles of one or more facilities providing cardiac surgical services. (3)\nA facility proposing to initiate an adult\ncardiac surgery center must document a cardiac patient base and current cardiac\ninterventional referrals sufficient to support a projected annual volume of at\nleast 300 cardiac surgery cases and a projected annual volume of at least 36\nemergency PCI cases within two years of approval. The criteria for evaluating\nthe need for additional adult cardiac surgery centers within the planning area\nshall include consideration of appropriate access and utilization, and the\nability of existing services within the planning area to provide such services. Waiver of this requirement may be considered if: (i) the HSA region's age adjusted, population\nbased use rate is less than the statewide average use rate; and\n(ii)\nexisting adult cardiac surgery centers\nin the applicant facility's planning area do not have the capacity or cannot\nadequately address the need for additional cardiac surgical procedures, such\ndeterminations to be based on factors including but not necessarily limited to\nanalyses of recent volume trends, analyses of Cardiac Reporting System data, and review by the area Health Systems Agency(s); and\n(iii)\nexisting cardiac surgical referral\npatterns within the planning area indicate that approval of an additional\nservice at the applicant facility will not jeopardize the minimum volume\nrequired at other existing cardiac surgical programs. (4)\n\nNo finding of need for the addition of\npediatric cardiac surgery center services will be made unless each existing\npediatric cardiac surgery center service in the planning area is operating and\nexpected to continue to operate at a level of at least 200 pediatric cardiac\nsurgical procedures per year, and unless such existing pediatric cardiac\nsurgery center services do not have the further capacity to meet projected need\nfor additional pediatric cardiac surgical procedures. Where public need is\nestablished herein, a facility proposing to provide pediatric cardiac surgical\nservices must demonstrate the ability to perform a minimum of 200 pediatric\ncardiac surgical procedures per year by the end of the second full calendar\nyear of operation or demonstrate the ability to perform a minimum of 50 cases a\nyear on-site and operate as part of a coordinated program based on a fully\nexecuted written agreement, approved by the commissioner, with another\npediatric cardiac surgery program in accordance with standards at section\n405.29\n(d)(5)(ii)\nof this Title. For hospitals seeking approval as part of a coordinated program, the agreement must be submitted with the certificate of need application and\nmust be approved by the department prior to initiation of the\nservice. (5)\nA facility proposing\nto provide adult and/or pediatric cardiac surgery center services shall: (i) submit a written plan to the Department\nof Health which, when implemented, will ensure access to cardiac surgical\nservices for all segments of the HSA region's population. Such plan shall\nprovide a detailed plan to reach patients not currently served within the\nplanning area, ensure continuity of care for patients transferred between\nfacilities, and shall otherwise promote planning for cardiac services within\nthe region; and\n(ii)\npropose a\nhospital based heart disease prevention program that, when implemented, shall\ninclude: (a) Treatment plans for cardiac\ninpatients with a principal diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. These patients\nare at high risk for development of adverse cardiovascular events and the\nprogram shall provide for the following in a comprehensive, systematic way: (1)\nprotocols shall be developed and\nimplemented for the assessment of risk factors including lipid disorders, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cigarette smoking, and sedentary lifestyle. Such protocols shall be in keeping with generally accepted standards; (2)\nthe hospital shall provide patient\neducation that shall include, but not be limited to, information on the\nimportance of assessing risk factors for heart disease in first-degree\nrelatives, and the importance of cardiopulmonary (CPR) training for family\nmembers and care givers; (3)\ndischarge plans must include: (i) a request\nfor consent to allow patient medical information to be shared with the\npatient's primary care providers; (ii)\npatient referral to their primary care\nprovider with documentation of treatments provided by the hospital and\nfollow-up care recommended by the hospital; and\n(iii)\npatient referral to cardiac\nrehabilitation programs appropriate to their needs. (b) Professional education: (1)\nthe hospital shall sponsor or co-sponsor\nat least three professional education programs per year related to heart\ndisease risk assessment and control and that are open to local community based\nhealth professionals. (c) Hospital based heart health promotion: (1)\nthe program shall implement policies and\nhealth programs in the hospital and establish environments that promote\nheart-healthy behaviors among hospital staff, employees and visitors, including: (i) prohibiting the sale and use\nof tobacco products on hospital premises; (ii)\noffering and promoting, on a regular\nbasis, healthful choices in hospital cafeterias and patient menus; and\n(iii)\noffering employee\nwellness and fitness programs that provide opportunities for employees to make\nhealthy choices. (d) Community based heart health promotion: (1)\n\nThe hospital shall organize or\nparticipate in a consortium of existing community-based organizations and key\ncommunity leaders to engage in activities to improve cardiac health in the\ncommunity; and\n(2)\norganize or\nparticipate in at least one major community based campaign (not including\nhealth fairs) each year related to major heart disease risk factors. (e) Program administration: (1)\nhospitals shall identify a team within\ntheir organization to coordinate heart disease prevention activities. Members\nof the team shall include a broad range of expertise, including but not limited\nto: community organization, planning, and social marketing, public health\nskills and health education. (6)\n\nWhen considering an application to meet\npublic need for adult and or pediatric cardiac surgery center services, priority consideration shall be given to the expansion of an existing service\nas opposed to the initiation of a new cardiac surgery center. (7)\n\nWhere public need is established herein, priority consideration will be given to applicants that agree to serve the\nmedically indigent and patients regardless of the source of payment. (8)\n\nApplicants proposing to initiate an adult\nand or pediatric cardiac surgery center service must: (i) demonstrate the ability to comply with\nstandards set forth in sections\n405.29\n(c) and (d)\nand\n711.4\n(h) of this\n\nTitle; and\n(ii)\nin addition, a\nfacility providing pediatric cardiac surgery center services also must comply\nwith the requirements specified in section\n711.4\n(f) of this\n\nTitle.
