Such features shall include, at a minimum, the following: (1)\nat least the first four inches of the\nbase plate shall be white; (2)\nthe\nsides of the shoe below the base plate shall be transparent or have a\ntransparent sealed cutout, unless the dealing shoe is otherwise constructed to\nprevent any object from being placed into, or removed from, the portion of the\ndealing shoe below the base plate and to permit the inspection of this portion\nof the shoe; and\n(3)\na stop\nunderneath the top of the face plate shall preclude the next card to be dealt\nfrom being moved upwards for more than 1/8 inch distance. (d) A baccarat dealing shoe, in addition to\nmeeting the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (3) of subdivision (c) of\nthis section, shall also adhere to the following specifications: (1)\na removable lid shall be opaque from the\npoint where it meets the face plate, to a point at least four inches from the\nface plate; (2)\nthe sides and back\nof the dealing shoe above the base plate shall be opaque; and\n(3)\na device within the shoe shall, when\nengaged, prevent the cards from moving backward in the shoe.
