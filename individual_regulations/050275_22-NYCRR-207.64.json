(4)\n\nWhen served with objections or a\nrequest for an inquiry or examination under SCPA 2211 or 1404 that specifies a\nrequest for particular unredacted documents previously filed in the proceeding\nwith respect to which the objection or request for inquiry or examination\nrelates, the party who originally served and filed the redacted document shall\nserve (but not file) an unredacted version upon all parties interested in the\nproceeding or such portion of it to which the objection or request for inquiry\nor examination relates. (b) Public Access to Certain Filings\n\nThe officers, clerks and employees of the\ncourt shall not permit a copy of any of the following documents to be viewed or\ntaken by any other person than a party to the proceeding, or the attorney or\ncounsel to a party to the proceeding, the Public Administrator or counsel\nthereto, counsel for any Federal, State or local governmental agency, or court\npersonnel, or by order of the court or written permission of the Surrogate or\n\nChief Clerk of the court.
