  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2523.4 - Failure to maintain services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\nA tenant may apply to the DHCR for a\nreduction of the legal regulated rent to the level in effect prior to the most\nrecent guidelines adjustment, subject to the limitations of subdivisions\n(c)-(h) of this section, and the DHCR shall so reduce the rent for the period\nfor which it is found that the owner has failed to maintain required services. The order reducing the rent shall further bar the owner from applying for or\ncollecting any further increases in rent that were or are authorized by this\n\nTitle until such services are restored or no longer required pursuant to an\norder of the DHCR. If the DHCR further finds that the owner has knowingly filed\na false certification, it may, in addition to abating the rent, assess the\nowner with the reasonable costs of the proceeding, including reasonable\nattorney's fees, and impose a penalty not in excess of $ 250 for each false\ncertification. (2)\n\nWhere an\napplication for a temporary rent adjustment pursuant to a Major Capital\n\nImprovement as set forth in section\n2522.4\n(b) of this\n\nTitle has been granted, and collection of such rent adjustment commenced prior\nto the effective date of the rent reduction order, the owner will not be\npermitted to continue to collect the rent adjustment while the rent reduction\norder is in effect. (b) Proceedings pending on the effective date of this Code (May 1, 1987) involving\ntenant complaints of owners' failure to provide hotel services shall be\ndetermined in accordance with the RSL and Hotel Industry Code in effect on\n\nApril 30, 1987. (c) Except for\ncomplaints pertaining to heat and hot water or other conditions requiring\nemergency repairs, before filing an application for a reduction of the legal\nregulated rent pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, a tenant should\nnotify the owner or the owner's agent in writing of all the service problems\nlisted in such application. A copy of the written notice to the owner or agent\nwith proof of mailing or delivery should be attached to the application. Applications should be filed with the DHCR no earlier than 10 days after such\nnotice is given to the owner or agent. Failure to provide such prior written\nnotice will not be grounds for dismissal of the application. Applications based\nupon a lack of adequate heat or hot water must be accompanied by a report from\nthe appropriate city agency finding such lack of adequate heat or hot\nwater. (d) (1)\n\nIn the event notice of any inspection is\ngiven by the DHCR in a proceeding commenced pursuant to this section, the\ninspection shall be conducted on notice to both the owner and tenant. (2)\n\nUpon receipt of a copy of the tenant's\ncomplaint from the DHCR, an owner shall have 20 days in which to respond if the\ntenant provided DHCR with the proof of the written notice to the owner. If the\ntenant did not provide proof of written notice to the owner, an owner shall\nhave 60 days in which to respond. If the tenant's complaint indicates that the\ntenant has been forced to vacate the premises, the owner shall have five days\nto respond. If the complaint pertains to heat and hot water or to a condition\nwhich in DHCR's opinion may require emergency repairs, the owner shall have 20\ndays to respond. Nothing herein shall preclude DHCR from granting an owner's\nrequest for a reasonable extension of time to respond in order to establish\nthat service problems have been repaired. If during this period of time, an\nowner has attempted, but been unable to obtain access to the subject housing\naccommodation to correct the service or equipment deficiency, the owner should\nset forth such facts in the response. Upon receipt thereof, in order to\nfacilitate the resolution of the complaint, the DHCR may direct an inspector to\naccompany the owner or the owner's agent to the housing accommodation to\ndetermine whether such access is being provided. In order for DHCR to\ncoordinate the inspection, the owner should indicate that access has been\ndenied in the response submitted to the DHCR and should include copies of two\nletters to the tenant attempting to arrange for access. Each of the letters\nmust have been mailed at least eight days prior to the date proposed for\naccess, and must have been mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested. Exceptions to such requirements for inspection may be permitted under emergency\nconditions, where special circumstances exist, or pursuant to court order. The\nservice complaint, or objection to a rent restoration application, by a tenant\nwho fails to provide access at the time arranged by the DHCR for the inspection\nwill be denied. (e) Certain conditions complained of as constituting a decrease in a required\nservice may be de minimis in nature, and therefore do not rise to the level of\na failure to maintain a required service for the purposes of this section. Such\nconditions are those that have only a minimal impact on tenants, do not affect\nthe use and enjoyment of the premises, and may exist despite regular\nmaintenance of services. The following schedule sets forth conditions that will\ngenerally not constitute a failure to maintain a required service. However, this schedule is not intended to be exclusive, and is not determinative in all\ncases and under all circumstances. Therefore, it does not include all\nconditions that may be considered de minimis, and there may be circumstances\nwhere a condition, although included on the schedule, will nevertheless be\nfound to constitute a decrease in a required service. Schedule of De Minimis Conditions Building-Wide\n\nConditions\n1. Air conditioner--failure\nto provide in lobby, hallways, stairwells, and other non-enclosed public\nareas. 2. Building entrance\ndoor--removal of canopy over unlocked door leading to vestibule; changes in\ndoor-locking devices, where security or access is not otherwise\ncompromised. 3.

(f) In determining whether a condition is de\nminimis, the DHCR may consider the passage of time during which a disputed\nservice was not provided and during which no complaint was filed by any tenant\nalleging failure to maintain such disputed service, as evidencing that such\nservice condition is de minimis, and therefore does not constitute a failure to\nmaintain a required service, provided that: (1)\nfor purposes of this subdivision, the\npassage of four years or more shall be considered presumptive evidence that the\ncondition is de minimis, with such four-year period to be measured without\nreference to any changes in building ownership or the tenancy of the subject\nhousing accommodation; (2)\nservices\nrequired to be provided by laws or regulations other than the RSL and this Code\nshall not be subject to this subdivision. (g) (1)\n\nExcept as to complaints of inadequate heat and/or hot water, or applications\nrelating to the restoration of rents based upon the restoration of such\nservices, whenever a complaint of building-wide reduction in services, or an\nowner's application relating to the restoration of rents based up on the\nrestoration of such services is filed, the tenants or owner may submit with the\ncomplaint, answer or application, the contemporaneous affidavit of an\nindependent licensed architect or engineer, substantiating the allegations of\nthe complaint, answer, or application. The affidavit shall state that the\nconditions that are the subject of the complaint, answer or application were\ninvestigated by the person signing the affidavit and that the conditions exist\nor do not exist. The affidavit shall specify what conditions were investigated\nand what the findings were with respect to each condition. The affidavit shall\nstate when the investigation was conducted, must be submitted within a\nreasonable time after the completion of the investigation, and when served by\nDHCR on the opposing party, will raise a rebuttable presumption that the\nconditions that are the subject of the complaint, answer or application exist\nor do not exist. (2)\n\nThe\npresumption raised by the affidavit may be rebutted only on the basis of\npersuasive evidence, including a counter affidavit by an independent licensed\narchitect or engineer, or a report of a subsequent inspection conducted, or a\nsubsequent violation imposed by a governmental agency, or an affirmation signed\nby 51 percent of the complaining tenants. Except for good cause shown, failure\nto rebut the presumption within 30 days will result in the issuance of an order\nwithout any further physical inspection of the premises by DHCR. (3)\n\nThere must be no common ownership, or\nother financial interest, between such architect or engineer, and the owner or\ntenants, and the affidavit shall state that there is no such relationship or\nother financial interest. The affidavit must also contain a statement that the\narchitect or engineer did not engage in the performance of any work, other than\nthe investigation, relating to the conditions that are the subject of the\naffidavit, and must contain the original signature and professional stamp of\nthe architect or engineer, not a copy. DHCR may conduct follow-up inspections\nrandomly to ensure that the affidavits accurately indicate the conditions of\nthe premises. Any person or party who submits a false statement will be subject\nto all penalties provided by law. (h) The amount of the reduction in rent\nordered by the DHCR pursuant to this section shall be reduced by any credit, abatement or offset in rent which the tenant has received pursuant to section\n235-b\nof\nthe Real Property Law, that relates to one or more conditions covered by such\norder.
