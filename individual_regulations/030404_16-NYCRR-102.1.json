Commercial areas essentially one lot deep along a\nthoroughfare are more aptly described as strip developments and not central\nbusiness districts. Central business districts occupy a relatively small\nproportion of the urbanized area--not over four percent even in the smallest\ncities and only 0.4 percent in the largest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n102.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
