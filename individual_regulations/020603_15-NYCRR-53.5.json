  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 53.5 - Requirements for approval\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No brake lining shall be approved which: (1)\nhas a normal friction coefficient below\nthat of code class E, or\n(2)\nhas a\nhot coefficient below that of code class D, or\n(3)\nexhibits a coefficient of friction below\n0.150 on any of the five tests at any of the following points: (i) between 200F and 550F inclusive on the\nsecond fade run, (ii)\nbetween 300F\nand 200F inclusive on the second recovery run. (b) No lining shall be approved which\nexhibits more than a 20 per cent or.050 variation of coefficient of friction, whichever is greater, below the average value of all five tests at each\ntemperature point specified in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (c) Approval of a brake\nlining as being in a specific coefficient of friction class does not constitute\napproval by the commissioner for installation of that lining in all vehicles or\nin any particular make or model of vehicle unless specifically stated. Brakes\nof different types require different levels of coefficient of friction which\ncan be categorized among the levels adopted. The coefficient of friction\nclasses do not substitute for the use of matched sets for particular\ninstallations. (d) The requirements\nof this section may be waived at the discretion of the commissioner with\nrespect to brake linings for special purpose vehicles or unusual brake designs\nsubject to such conditions which will assure safety as the commissioner may\nprescribe in each specific case. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n53.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
