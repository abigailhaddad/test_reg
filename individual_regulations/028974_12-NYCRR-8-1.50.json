  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 8-1.50 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Angle of\ninclination. The angle of inclination of an escalator shall not exceed 30\ndegrees with the horizontal. (b) Width. (1)\n\nThe width of an escalator shall be\nmeasured between the balustrading at a vertical height of 24 inches above the\nnose line of the treads. (2)\n\nEscalators shall be not less than 22 inches nor more than 48 inches\nwide. (3)\n\nEscalators greater than\n29 inches in width shall have a horizontal tread formation. (c) Balustrading. (1)\n\nEscalators shall be provided on each side\nwith \"solid balustrading\". On the escalator side the \"balustrading\" shall be\nsmooth, without depressed or raised paneling or molding. Glass panels in\n\"balustrading\" shall be prohibited. (2)\n\nThere shall be no abrupt changes in the\nwidth between the \"balustrading\" on the two sides of the escalator. Should any\nchange in the width be necessary, the change shall be not more than eight per\ncent of the greatest width. (3)\n\nIn\nchanging from the greater to the smaller width the change in the direction of\nthe \"balustrading\" shall not exceed 15 degrees from the line of the escalator\ntravel. (4)\n\"Balustrading\" shall be\nequipped with a handrail moving at the same speed and in the same direction as\nthe travel of the escalator. (d) Tread guards. (1)\n\nStationary tread guards shall be provided\non the escalator side of the \"balustrading\" along the whole length of, and\nimmediately above the nose line of the escalator treads. (2)\n\nEscalator treads and landings shall be of\nmaterial affording secure foothold, such as wood or material used for \"safety\ntreads\". If the landing is of concrete, it shall have edge insertions of metal, wood or other anti-slip material. (e) Strength of trusses or girders. (1)\n\nEscalator trusses or girders shall be\ndesigned with a factor of safety not less than five based on the static\nloads. (2)\n\nThe escalator truss or\ngirder shall be designed to safely retain the escalator treads in their runs if\nthe tread chain breaks while supporting the maximum load. (f) Track arrangement. The track arrangement\nfor guiding the escalator tread shall prevent the displacement of the upper\nline of treads if the tread chain breaks. (g) Capacity and loading. (1)\n\nThe maximum load permitted on an\nescalator 24 inches or less in width shall be computed by the following\nformula: Maximum load--110A. (2)\n\nThe maximum load permitted on an escalator wider than 24 inches but not\nexceeding 36 inches shall be computed by the following formula: Maximum load--\n110+5 (W-24) XA. (3)\n\nThe maximum\nload permitted on an escalator wider than 36 inches but not exceeding 48 inches\nshall be computed by the following formula: Maximum load-- 160+5 (W-36) XA. Note: In these formulas, W is the width of the\nescalator in inches and A is the horizontal projected length in feet of the\nexposed treads. The maximum load is expressed in pounds. (h) Limits of speed. The speed of\nan escalator shall not exceed 100 feet per minute. (i) Application of power. (1)\n\nEscalators shall be driven by direct\nconnected electric motors. Two or more escalators placed side by side and\noperated as a single unit may be driven by one motor. (2)\n\nThe chain or chains used for driving\nescalators shall have a factor of safety of not less than 10. (3)\n\nEvery escalator \"drive\" shall be provided\nwith an electrically released, mechanically applied brake, which shall stop the\nescalator automatically when the power is cut off. (4)\n\nThere shall be an emergency \"stop\" button\nor other type of switch accessible to the public, conspicuously located at the\ntop and the bottom of each escalator runway. (5)\n\nThe operation of either one of these\nbuttons or switches shall cause the opening of the power circuit, application\nof the brake and stoppage of the escalator. It shall be impossible to start an\nescalator by means of these buttons or switches. (6)\n\nThese buttons or switches shall be marked\n\"escalator stop button\" or \"escalator stop switch\". (7)\n\nEscalators operated in the ascending\ndirection shall be equipped with a safety mechanism to prevent accidental\nreversal of the escalator. (8)\n\nOn a\nreversible escalator the safety mechanism shall be arranged to be inoperative\nwhen the escalator is descending and operative when the escalator is ascending. The safety mechanism shall be provided with a contractor, the functioning of\nwhich will cause the opening of the power circuit and the application of the\nbrake. (9)\n\nEscalators operating in\na descending direction shall be provided with a safety mechanism to prevent the\nescalator attaining excessive speed. (10)\n\nEscalators operated by polyphase\nalternating current motors shall be provided with relays of the potential type\nwhich will prevent starting the motor while: (i) the phase rotation is in the wrong\ndirection, or\n(ii)\nthere is a\nfailure in any phase. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n8-1.50\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
