(1)\n\nReferences to sources to determine factual situations, such as employee status, membership in a collective bargaining unit or a union, other benefits, salary, termination of employment or membership, are not incorporations by reference within the meaning of section 142(1) of the Insurance Law. Source documents or relevant excerpts therefrom referred to for such data as the plan of benefits expressed in a collective bargaining agreement or trust instrument shall accompany the policy filing. (2)\n\nNo policy or certificate shall be designated \"basic\" or \"major medical\" unless it provides at least the minimum benefits in section\n52.5, 52.6\nor\n52.7\nof this Part, respectively. Policies meeting the definition of section\n52.8, 52.9\nor\n52.10\nof this Part shall not be designated in any manner inconsistent with the applicable definition or which would encourage misrepresentation of the actual coverage provided. (3)\n\nWhere a policy is written that provides at least the coverages required for both basic hospital insurance under section\n52.5\nof this Part and basic medical insurance under section\n52.6, the allowable deductible may be applied to the combined coverage. (4)\n\nWhere a policy is written that provides at least the coverages required for both basic hospital insurance under section\n52.5\nof this Part and basic medical insurance under section\n52.6, the required anesthetic coverage may be provided as part of the miscellaneous hospital benefit instead of a separate anesthetic benefit, provided that the limit of the miscellaneous hospital benefit is sufficient to meet the combined minimum requirements of both the miscellaneous hospital benefit of basic hospital insurance and the anesthesia benefit of basic medical insurance. (5)\n\nPolicies which provide benefits as described in 42 U.S.C. section\n300\ngg - 91(c), except for policies defined in sections 52.11, 52.12, 52.13 and 52.14 of this Part and policies subject to the requirements of section\n52.20\nof this Part, may not exclude, limit or reduce coverage for a loss due to a preexisting condition for a period greater than 12 months following the effective date of an insured's coverage.

For purposes of this paragraph, a preexisting condition is one for which medical advice was given, treatment was recommended by or received from a physician, within six months before the effective date of an insured's coverage.

Delivery of the guide shall be made whether or not such certificates are advertised, solicited or issued as Medicare supplement insurance as defined in this regulation. Except in the case of direct response insurers, delivery of the guide shall be made to the applicant at the time of application and written acknowledgment of receipt of the guide shall be obtained by the insurer. Direct response insurers shall deliver the guide to the applicant upon request but in no event later than at the time the certificate is delivered. If the guide has not been made available from the Health Care Financing Administration at the time that the insurer is required to deliver such guide, then the insurer shall provide the applicant with a notice that the guide is presently unavailable and that it will be delivered to the applicant at such time that it is available to the insurer.

However, if the infant is covered under a different policy than the mother and the screening and referral are performed by a provider of pediatric services, coverage for the screening and referral shall also be provided under the policy in which the infant is covered. (b) Benefits. (1)\n\nNo policy shall predicate benefits on loss due to violent and external means. Accidental means shall be interpreted in New York in accordance with applicable New York case law. (2)\n\nSpecific dismemberment benefits shall not be in lieu of other benefits unless equal to or greater than the other benefits. (3)\n\nAccidental death and dismemberment benefits shall be payable if the loss occurs within 90 days from the date of the accident, irrespective of total disability. (4)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, upon termination of insurance, whether due to termination of employment, termination of eligibility or termination of the policy, an extension of benefits shall be provided during a period of total disability for hospital confinements commencing or surgery performed during the next 31 days for the injury, sickness or pregnancy causing the total disability. (5)\n\nWhere major medical insurance or insurance providing major medical type benefits is terminated by reason of termination of active employment, an extended benefit shall be provided during total disability, with respect to the sickness, injury or pregnancy which caused the disability, of at least 12 months subsequent to termination of insurance unless coverage is afforded for the total disability under another group plan. (6)\n(i) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision, policies providing benefits for hospital and/or medical expenses may provide benefits for covered expenses incurred as a result of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions if those expenses arise after termination of coverage, but as a result of pregnancies commencing while coverage is in force. If such benefits after termination of coverage are provided, it is not necessary to provide benefits for expenses incurred as a result of a sickness or injury commencing while coverage is in force if those expenses are incurred after termination of coverage, except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nIf any policy providing coverage for pregnancies commencing while coverage is in force is revised to provide coverage for pregnancy for a different time period (e.g., coverage provided for the same period of time as for other medical conditions), the following shall apply: (a) Any woman covered under the policy on the effective date of the revision who is then pregnant may not be deprived thereby of her right to coverage for that pregnancy to the extent of the benefits provided under the policy before it was revised, unless she qualifies under the revised policy for a greater benefit. (b) Appropriate notice shall be given to the certificate holders that, in the event of termination of insurance, no benefits will be payable for expenses incurred after termination of coverage for a pregnancy commencing while coverage was in force unless at the time of termination the covered female was totally disabled.

(9)\n\nSurgical schedules contained in the policy shall include a provision providing coverage for procedures not specifically listed in the schedules and not otherwise excluded by the policy and benefits therefor shall be consistent with the benefits for comparable procedures. (10)\n\nMultiple surgical procedures performed during the same operative session and through the same incision shall be reimbursed in an amount not less than that stated in the schedule for the most expensive procedure then being performed. Multiple surgical procedures performed during the same operative session but through different incisions shall be reimbursed in an amount not less than that stated in the schedule for the most expensive procedure then being performed and with regard to the less expensive procedures in an amount at least equal to 50 percent of the scheduled amount for these procedures, unless a different amount is specifically set forth in the State of New York Certified Surgical Fee Schedule. (11)\n\nIn major medical insurance policies and policies providing major medical type benefits, the benefit period and the maximum amount payable during the benefit period shall be such that the maximum can reasonably be expected to be incurred during the benefit period, unless the policy maximum is designed to protect against catastrophic loss. (12)\n\nIn major medical insurance policies and policies providing major medical type benefits, if a benefit period commences with the first expense used to satisfy a deductible, and under the policy terms no further benefits become payable for the same cause after termination of such period, no benefit period shall end before the expiration of nine months after the deductible is satisfied, except when the benefit period is determined by a calendar date unrelated to the incidence of the first expense. (13)\n\nWhere disability income benefits are integrated with social security benefits, the policy shall provide that the amount of any disability benefits actually being paid to a disabled person shall not subsequently be reduced by changes in the level of social security benefits resulting from cost of living adjustment or changes in the Social Security Law which became effective after the first day for which disability benefits became payable. (c) Renewal and cancellation. (1)\n\nNotices of nonrenewal or termination shall provide for at least 30 days' prior notice except where otherwise specifically prescribed by statute. Any other conditions for nonrenewal or termination shall be fully set forth in the policy. (2)\n\nNo termination of coverage shall prejudice the right to a claim for benefits which arose prior to such termination. (d) Nonduplication of coverage and coordination of benefits provisions. (1)\n\nCoordination of benefits provisions in group contracts may apply to service type plans, prepaid group practice plans, group and blanket insurance, self-insured or noninsured plans, franchise plans, group salary continuance programs, State or Federal programs except Medicaid and mandatory no-fault automobile insurance benefits. (2)\n\nLife, annuity or pension benefits under a plan of the same or a related employer may be offset against disability income benefits, subject to the following: (i) early retirement benefits may be offset only if such early retirement is elected by the employee or does not reduce the amount of his accrued annuity or pension benefits then funded; (ii)\ndisability income benefits under a life insurance plan may be offset only if payment of such benefits does not reduce the amount of the employee's life insurance or if a employee may elect not to apply for such benefits even though disabled. The term related employer includes any individual, partnership or corporation under common control. (3)\n\nNo group or blanket policy of accident and health insurance may offset the payment of benefits thereunder by benefits provided pursuant to General Municipal Law section 205-c c\n(e) Coverage of dependents. (1)\n\nExcept as required by law coverage of dependents is conditioned upon the employee or member being covered under the policy, however dependents' coverage may be continued following death of the employee or member, entry of the employee or member into military service, or similar circumstances. (2)\nA family policy shall provide that adopted children and stepchildren dependent upon the insured be eligible for coverage on the same basis as natural children. (3)\nA family policy covering a proposed adoptive parent on whom the child is dependent shall provide that such child be eligible for coverage on the same basis as a natural child during any waiting period prior to the finalization of the child's adoption.
