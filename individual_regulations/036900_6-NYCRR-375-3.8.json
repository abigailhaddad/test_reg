  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 375-3.8 - Remedial program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The remedy\nshall be fully protective of public health and the environment including, but\nnot limited to, groundwater according to its classification pursuant to ECL\n17-0301, drinking water, surface water and air (including indoor air), sensitive populations, including children and ecological resources, including\nfish and wildlife. In addition, a remedy will be selected upon consideration of\nthe following: (1)\na remedial program that\nachieves a permanent cleanup of a contaminated site, including the restoration\nof groundwater to its classified use, is preferred over a remedial program that\ndoes not do so; (2)\nthe selection\nof a remedy will take into account the current, intended, and reasonably\nanticipated future land uses of the site and its surroundings; and\n(3)\nthe risk presented by residual\ncontamination as defined at ECL 27- 1405.28 at a site shall not exceed an\nexcess cancer risk of one in one million for carcinogenic end points and a\nhazard index of one for non-cancer end points, except: (i) for remedies developed in accordance with\nparagraph (e)(4) of this section, with a cleanup level which exceeds the\nparameters in this paragraph, the remedial party must demonstrate that such\nlevel would be protective of public health and the environment. This\ndemonstration must be included in the alternatives analysis developed in\naccordance with subdivision (f) of this section; and\n(ii)\na cleanup level which exceeds the\nparameters in this paragraph, may be approved by the department under paragraph\n(e)(4) of this section, without requiring the use of institutional or\nengineering controls to eliminate exposure only upon a site-specific finding by\nthe commissioner, in consultation with the State Commissioner of Health, that\nsuch level shall be protective of public health and the environment. (b) Scope of\ninvestigation. Remedial investigations and final investigation reports must be\ncompleted in accordance with ECL 27-1411(1); ECL 27- 1415(2) and this Part. (1)\n\nOn-site contamination. Applicants must\nfully investigate and characterize the nature and extent of contamination on\nthe brownfield site. (2)\n\nOff-site\ncontamination. Responsibility for off-site contamination is determined by the\napplicant's status: (i) a volunteer shall\nperform a qualitative exposure assessment of the contamination that has\nmigrated from the site in accordance with ECL 27- 1415(2)(b) and department\nguidance. For sites being addressed by a volunteer, the volunteer has no\nobligation to implement a remedy to address an off-site exposure identified by\nthis assessment. The department will: (a) bring an enforcement action against any parties known or suspected to be\nresponsible for contamination (other than such volunteer) at or emanating from\nthe site according to applicable principles of statutory or common law\nliability within six months of the determination that a site poses a\nsignificant threat; or\n(b) if such\naction cannot be brought, or does not result in the initiation of a remedial\nprogram by such party or parties at such site, use best efforts to begin a\nremedial program to perform the remediation of off-site contamination at such\nsite within one year of the completion of such enforcement action or the\ncompletion of the volunteer's on-site remedial program, whichever is later; or\n(ii)\na participant\nshall fully investigate and characterize the nature and extent of contamination\nthat has migrated or emanated from the site to off-site locations. (3)\n\nThe final remedial\ninvestigation report must demonstrate whether conditions at the site meet the\napplicable unrestricted use soil cleanup objectives set forth in Table\n375-6.8(a) of this Part without remediation. (4)\n\nWhere the applicable unrestricted use\nsoil cleanup objectives set forth in Table 375-6.8(a) of this Part will not be\nachieved, any determination that the requirements of the Brownfield Cleanup\n\nProgram have been met without the need for remediation must be supported by an\nalternatives analysis. (c) Remedy selection. (1)\n\nApplicants must, based upon the\ncharacterization of the nature and extent of contamination on-site and\nqualitative exposure assessment, select or propose a remedy for the\ncontamination present on the site and address further contaminant migration\nfrom the site. (2)\n\nParticipants\nmust also, based upon the characterization of the nature and extent of\ncontamination that has migrated from the site, propose or select a remedy which\naddresses the off-site contamination. (3)\n\nThe department will select, or approve, a\nremedy for a site after consideration of an alternatives analysis, including an\nevaluation consistent with section\n375-1.8\n(f) of this\n\nPart, presented in, or made part of, a site specific remedial work plan in\naccordance with ECL section 27-1413(2). (4)\n\nSelection of a remedy. For sites that the\ndepartment has determined: (i) constitute a\nsignificant threat, the department shall select the remedy from the\ndepartment-approved alternatives analysis; or\n(ii)\ndo not constitute a significant threat, the applicant may select the remedy from a department-approved alternatives\nanalysis. (d) Application of the soil cleanup objectives. (1)\n\nGeneral. The department may approve a\nremedial program that utilizes different tracks and soil cleanup objectives for\ndifferent uses between different areas of a site, provided such areas can be\ndefined and described in the environmental easement and the necessary\ninstitutional and engineering controls can be effectively imposed, implemented, operated, monitored and maintained in accordance with the department-approved\nsite management plan. (2)\n\nCleanup\nobjectives for other media. The exposure to public health and the environment\nresulting from contamination in all other environmental media shall be\nevaluated and cleanup objectives to eliminate or mitigate the exposure shall be\nproposed by the remedial party and any cleanup objectives approved by the\ndepartment for other media will be included in the alternatives analysis to\nensure that the remedial program meets the requirements of this subdivision and\nsection\n375-1.8\nof this Part. (e) Cleanup tracks. For sites or\nportions of sites where the department has determined that remediation is\nneeded to meet the remedial program requirements, each remedial alternative\nthat is developed and evaluated shall, in addition to all other requirements in\nthis section and section\n375-1.8\n(c) of this\n\nPart, conform to the requirements of one of the following cleanup tracks. (1)\n\nTrack 1: Unrestricted use.

The use of short-term\ninstitutional or engineering controls is allowed, provided: (a) the remedial program includes an active\ntreatment system, either ex-situ or in-situ, which will operate for, or\nrequire, no more than five years to meet the applicable contaminant-specific\nsoil cleanup objectives or remedial goals established; (b) the remedial program requires the\ninstitutional control to assure the operation and integrity of the remedy, as\nwell as to address potential human health exposures during this period; and\n(c) the remedial program\nincludes a provision for the applicant to implement an alternative remedy to\nmeet the soil cleanup objectives in the event that the short-term institutional\nperiod is exceeded; (v) the remedial program may include the use of long-term institutional or\nengineering controls to address contamination related to other media including, but not limited to groundwater and soil vapor; and\n(vi)\nthe department may require the remedial\nparty, or the remedial party may request, to develop a soil cleanup objective\nfor a contaminant not included in Table 375-6.8(b) as set forth in section\n375-6.9\nof this Part. (3)\n\nTrack 3: Restricted use with\nmodified soil cleanup objectives. The remedial program for a site being\naddressed pursuant to Track 3 shall satisfy the provisions for a Track 2\nremedial program; provided, however, the department may approve the\nmodification of one or more of the contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives\nset forth in Table 375-6.8(b) of this Part based upon site-specific data. Any\nsuch modification shall be performed in accordance with section\n375-6.9\nof this Part. (4)\n\nTrack 4: Restricted use with\nsite-specific soil cleanup objectives. The following provisions apply to a\nsite, or portion thereof, being addressed pursuant to Track 4: (i) in developing the site-specific soil\ncleanup objectives, the applicant may, solely or in combination: (a) use the soil cleanup objectives, as set\nforth in Subpart 375-6 of this Part; (b) develop or modify site-specific soil\ncleanup objectives, as set forth at section\n375-6.9\nof this Part; or\n(c) propose site-specific soil cleanup\nobjectives which are protective of public health and the environment; (ii)\nthe remedial program may\ninclude the use of long-term institutional or engineering controls to address\nall media; and\n(iii)\nexposed\nsurface soils in a Track 4 remedy will be addressed as follows: (a) for residential use: (1)\nthe top two feet of all exposed surface\nsoils which exceed the site background values for contaminants of concern and\nare not otherwise covered by the components of the development of the site\n(e.g., buildings, pavement), shall not exceed the applicable\ncontaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives as set forth in subparagraph\n(2)(ii) of this subdivision; and\n(2)\nwhere it is necessary to utilize off-site\nsoil to achieve this requirement, the soil brought to the site will satisfy the\nrequirements of section 375- 6.7(d) of this Part; (b) for commercial use: (1)\nthe top one foot of all exposed surface\nsoils which exceed the site background values for contaminants of concern and\nare not otherwise covered by the components of the development of the site\n(e.g., buildings, pavement), shall not exceed the applicable\ncontaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives as set forth in subparagraph\n(2)(ii) of this subdivision; and\n(2)\nwhere it is necessary to utilize off-site\nsoil to achieve this requirement, the soil brought to the site will satisfy the\nrequirements of section 375- 6.7(d) of this Part; (c) for industrial use: (1)\nthe top one foot of all exposed surface\nsoils which exceed the site background values for contaminants of concern and\nare not otherwise covered by the components of the development of the site\n(e.g., buildings, pavement), shall not exceed the applicable\ncontaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives as set forth in subparagraph\n(2)(ii) of this subdivision; and\n(2)\nwhere it is necessary to utilize off-site\nsoil to achieve this requirement, the soil brought to the site will satisfy the\nrequirements of section 375- 6.7(d) of this Part. (5)\n\nAll Tracks. For\nremedial programs under all Tracks, the threat to public health and the\nenvironment resulting from contamination in environmental media other than soil\nshall be evaluated in the development of remedial alternatives and addressed in\nthe alternatives analysis to ensure that the remedial program meets the\nrequirements of ECL 27-1415(1), subdivisions (a) and (f) of this section, and\nsection\n375-6.7\nof this Part. (f) Alternatives analysis. An\nalternatives analysis evaluates each remedial alternative developed for a\nbrownfield site, using the selection factors set forth in section\n375-1.8\n(f) of this\n\nPart. (1)\n\nAn alternatives analysis must be\nprepared for each site, or operable unit of a site, unless: (i) the department has selected a remedy for\nthe site in a record of decision under Subpart 375-2 or Subpart 375-4 of this\n\nPart prior to the approval of the application for participation; (ii)\nthe remedy proposed meets the\nrequirements of Track 1; or\n(iii)\nthe department has approved the use of a presumptive remedy proposed from a\ndepartment-approved list of presumptive remedies. (2)\n\nContents of an alternatives analysis. Each alternatives analysis must include, but is not limited to: (i) a description of each alternative\nevaluated in the analysis. Alternatives must be developed and evaluated which\naddress: (a) on-site contamination if the\napplicant is a volunteer; and\n(b) on-site and off-site contamination if the applicant is a participant; (ii)\na discussion of how each\nalternative would achieve the requirements of the remedial program, including\nthe Track-specific requirements; (iii)\nan analysis of each alternative against\nthe remedy selection factors set forth in section\n375-1.8\n(f) of this\n\nPart followed by a comparison of this evaluation to any other alternatives\nunder consideration; (iv)\nan\nevaluation of the reliability and viability of the long-term implementation, maintenance, monitoring, and enforcement of any proposed institutional or\nengineering controls set forth in section\n375-1.8\n(h) of this\n\nPart required by ECL 27-1415(7)(a); (v) if applicable, an evaluation of feasible\nremedial alternatives that can achieve groundwater plume stabilization in\naccordance with section\n375-1.8\n(d) of this\n\nPart; (vi)\nan identification of the\nalternative preferred by the applicant for selection; (vii)\na summary of the proposed remedy and\nbasis for concluding that the proposed remedy represents the best alternative\namong those considered; and\n(viii)\nother information required by the department. (3)\n\nAlternatives to be evaluated. The\nalternatives analysis proposing a remediation: (i) pursuant to Track 1, shall develop and\nevaluate at least one remedial alternative capable of achieving the\nrequirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section; or\n(ii)\npursuant to a Track other than Track 1, shall develop and evaluate two or more remedial alternatives, as follows: (a) at least one unrestricted alternative\nthat meets the requirements of Track 1 as set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this\nsection, unless a presumptive remedy is selected from a department-approved\nlist; (b) such other alternatives\nwhich may be developed by the applicant for the proposed use of the\nsite; (c) for sites determined by\nthe department to constitute a significant threat, such additional alternatives\nas the department may require; and\n(d) for sites determined by the department\nnot to constitute a significant threat, the department may require a Track 2\nevaluation if one has not already been considered pursuant to subparagraph (i)\nof this paragraph or subclauses (2)-(4) of this clause after considering the\nfollowing factors: (1)\nthe degree to which\nthe remedy selection criteria would be better satisfied by a Track 2\ncleanup; (2)\nthe degree of impact a\n\nTrack 2 cleanup would have on the applicant's ability to successfully cleanup\nand/or redevelop the property; (3)\nthe benefit to the environment to be realized by the expeditious remediation of\nthe property; and\n(4)\nthe economic\nbenefit to the State to be realized by the expeditious remediation of the\nproperty. (4)\n\nPlume stabilization. In developing\nremedies for a site where plume stabilization in accordance with section\n375-1.8\n(d) of this\n\nPart is a necessary component of the remedy where such plume is emanating from\nan on-site source. (i) A participant shall\naddress, to the extent feasible, the on-site and off-site plume. This\nrequirement includes such actions to maintain and monitor any stabilization of\nthe plume. (ii)\nA volunteer shall\naddress, to the extent feasible, the on-site plume and prevent the further\nmigration of any plume off-site at the site boundary. This requirement includes\nsuch actions to maintain and monitor any stabilization of the plume. (g) Remedial work plan. (1)\n\nThe department will issue a decision\ndocument describing the remedy for a site, unless it has previously issued a\nrecord of decision under Subpart 375-2 or Subpart 375-4 of this Part prior to\nthe approval of an application to this program. The remedial work plan shall\nimplement the decision document or record of decision. (2)\nA remedial work plan must be prepared in\naccordance with ECL 27-1411 and 27-1415 and must provide for the development\nand implementation of the remedy, selected as set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of\nthis section, for: (i) on-site contamination\nif the applicant is a volunteer; and\n(ii)\non-site and off-site contamination if\nthe applicant is a participant. (3)\nA remedial work plan must include at a\nminimum: (i) a summary of the site history and\nthe nature and extent of contamination; (ii)\nremedial action objectives; (iii)\na summary of the current, intended, and\nreasonably anticipated future use of the site; (iv)\nidentification of the cleanup track to\nbe used for remediation of the site as described in subdivision (e) of this\nsection; (v) identification and\nevaluation of any and all institutional or engineering controls to be employed\nas part of the site remedy as required pursuant to section\n375-1.8\n(h) of this\n\nPart, if applicable, and subparagraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section; (vi)\nan alternatives analysis as set forth in\nsubdivision (f) of this section; and\n(vii)\nother information as required by the\ndepartment.
