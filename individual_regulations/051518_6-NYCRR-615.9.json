(b) A person may\npetition the department for a declaratory ruling in accordance with the\nprocedures contained in Part 619 of this Title, with respect to the\napplicability to any person of sections 52-0111 and 52-0113 of the ECL, these\nregulations and any procedures adopted pursuant thereto. (c) A person deciding to challenge the basis\nof any equal employment opportunity and minority and women-owned business\nenterprise program determinations must do so in writing, within 30 business\ndays of the date of the department's determination. The written challenge must\nstate the factual determinations of the department with which the person\ndisagrees and the nature of any legal issues presented by the\nchallenge. (d) Upon receipt of the\nwritten challenge, the department will determine whether the initial\ndetermination should be revised or may request additional information. (1)\n\nIf the department agrees with the person\nmaking the written challenge, it shall notify that person of its\nagreement. (2)\n\nIf the department\ndoes not agree with the person, it shall notify the person accordingly, with an\nexplanation of the reasons for the disagreement, together with a form letter\nfor the person to use if further review is requested. (e) If the person receives a notice of\ndisagreement and continues to believe the department is wrong, that person must\ncomplete and mail the form letter to the department, at the address provided, within 10 business days of the date of the notice. (f) Upon receipt of the request for further\nreview, the Office of Affirmative Action will arrange for a conference with a\ndesignated representative(s) of the department, to be held at the department's\ncentral office in Albany or a mutually agreed-upon location. The department\nwill give the person at least 10 business days' notice of the time and place of\nthe conference. (g) The purpose of\nthe conference is to afford the person challenging the department's\ndetermination the opportunity to narrow factual disagreements, to state more\nspecifically the legal basis of any challenge, and to resolve the controversy\nif possible. It is the person's responsibility to state precisely the basis for\nthe challenge and to offer supporting documentation necessary to support the\nclaim. (h) Except for good cause, the failure of a person challenging a determination of the department to take\nany actions required for a challenge, within the time periods set forth in this\nsection, shall be a basis for a determination by the department that the\nchallenge has been abandoned, resulting in the department's determination\nbecoming final. (i) Within 30\nbusiness days following the conference, the department's designated\nrepresentatives will notify the person in writing of the department's\ndetermination. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
