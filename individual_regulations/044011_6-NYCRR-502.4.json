  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 502.4 - Floodplain management criteria for state projects in flood hazard areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When the\nadministrator has not provided data for a city, town or village to designate a\nregulatory floodway, or if that data has been provided and such regulatory\nfloodway has not yet been designated, or when the administrator has not\nidentified coastal high hazard areas in a city, town or village, any State\nagency proposing to commence any project within a flood hazard area in that\ncity, town or village shall do so only if it determines such project is in\ncompliance with the following criteria: (1)\n\nState agencies shall consider other alternative sites on which the project\ncould be located which would not involve a flood hazard area. (2)\n\nAll necessary permits shall be acquired\nfrom those governmental agencies from which approval is required by Federal or\n\nState law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act\n\nAmendments of 1972 ( 33 U.S.C. 1334\n). (3)\n\nThe proposed project shall: (i) be designed (or modified) and adequately\nanchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the\nproject; (ii)\nbe constructed with\nmaterials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; and\n(iii)\nbe constructed by methods and practices\nthat minimize flood damage. (4)\n\nThe proposed project shall be designed\nand constructed so that: (i) it is consistent\nwith the need to minimize flood damage within the flood hazard area; (ii)\nall public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electric and water systems, are located and constructed to\nminimize or eliminate flood damage; and\n(iii)\nadequate drainage is provided to reduce\nexposure to flood hazards. (5)\n\nNew and replacement water supply systems\nshall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the\nsystems. (6)\n\nNew and replacement\nsanitary sewage systems and any other waste disposal systems shall be designed\nto minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems, and\ndischarges from the systems into floodwaters, and new and replacement onsite\nwaste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or\ncontamination from them during flooding. (7)\n\nAll new residential structures and\nsubstantial improvements of existing residential structures shall have the\nlowest floor (including basement) elevated to not less than one foot above the\nbase flood level. (8)\n\nAll new\nnonresidential structures and substantial improvements of existing\nnonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)\nelevated or flood-proofed to not less than one foot above the base flood level, so that below this elevation the structure, together with attendant utility and\nsanitary facilities, is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the\npassage of water and with structural components having the capability of\nresisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. (9)\n\nWhere floodproofing is utilized for a\nparticular structure in order to comply with this Part, a professional engineer\nor architect licensed to practice in New York State shall certify to said State\nagency that the floodproofing methods are adequate to withstand the flood\ndepths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors\nassociated with the base flood. (10)\n\nFor the purpose of the determination of\napplicable flood insurance risk premium rates for structures insurable under\nthe National Flood Insurance Program (42\nU.S.C. §\n4001\net seq.) (see section 503.1 of\nthis Title), said agency shall: (i) obtain\nthe elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest habitable floor\n(including basement) of any new or substantially improved structures, and\nspecify whether or not such structure contains a basement; (ii)\nif a structure has been flood-proofed, obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was\nflood-proofed; and\n(iii)\nmaintain\nrecords of such information. (11)\n\nIn riverine situations, affected cities, towns and villages and the department shall be notified in writing by said\n\nState agency prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. (12)\n\nThe flood carrying capacity within any\naltered or relocated portion of any watercourse shall be maintained. (13)\n\nAll mobile homes shall be anchored to\nresist flotation, collapse or lateral movement by providing over-the-top and\nframe ties to ground anchors as follows: (i) over-the-top ties shall be provided at each of the four corners of the mobile\nhome, with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations (except that\nmobile homes less than 50 feet long shall require only one additional tie per\nside); (ii)\nframe ties shall be\nprovided at each corner of the home, with five additional ties per side at\nintermediate points (except that mobile homes less than 50 feet long shall\nrequire only four additional ties per side); (iii)\nall components of the anchoring system\nshall be capable of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds; and\n(iv)\nany additions to the mobile home shall\nbe similarly anchored. (14)\n\nAll mobile homes shall have: (i) stands or lots that are elevated on\ncompacted fill or on pilings or piers so that the lowest floor of the mobile\nhome will be located not less than one foot above the base flood\nlevel; (ii)\nadequate surface\ndrainage; (iii)\nlots that are large\nenough to permit steps from the ground into the mobile home and ready access\nfor a hauler; (iv)\nin the case of\nelevation on pilings or piers, pier foundations or pilings that are placed in\nstable soil no more than 10 feet apart; and\n(v) in the case of elevation on piers, adequate reinforcement for piers that extend more than six feet above ground\nlevel. (15)\n\nIn riverine\nsituations, no project (including fill) shall be undertaken unless it is\ndemonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed project, when combined\nwith all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the\nexisting water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any\npoint. Provided, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any\nproject being undertaken on a site where there is less than one square mile of\ndrainage area for the watercourse involved above such site, and where the\nadministrator has not provided final flood base elevations on a city, town or\nvillage's FIRM. (16)\n\nNo project\n(including fill) shall be undertaken unless it is demonstrated that the\ncumulative effect of the proposed project, when combined with all existing\ndevelopment, will not cause any material flood damage to such existing\ndevelopment. (17)\n\nIn order to\nprevent potential flood damage to certain facilities that would result in\nserious danger to life and health, or widespread social or economic\ndislocation, none of the following new projects shall be undertaken within any\nflood hazard area: (i) facilities designed for\nbulk storage of chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances or\nfloatable materials; (ii)\nhospitals, rest homes, correctional facilities, dormitories, patient care\nfacilities; (iii)\nmajor power\ngeneration, transmission or substation facilities, except for hydroelectric\nfacilities; (iv)\nmajor\ncommunications centers, such as civil defense centers; or\n(v) major emergency service facilities, such\nas central fire and police stations. (b) When the administrator has provided data\nfor a city, town or village to designate a regulatory floodway and such\nfloodway has been designated by a city, town or village, any State agency\nproposing to commence any project in a flood hazard area in such city, town or\nvillage shall do so only if it determines such project is in compliance with\nthe following criteria: (1)\n\nThe requirements\nof subdivision (a) of this section, except for the provisions of paragraph (15)\nof said subdivision. (2)\n\nNo portion\nof the project, including encroachments, fill, new construction or substantial\nimprovements, shall be placed or located within the adopted regulatory floodway\nthat would result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the\nbase flood discharge, except where the effect on flood levels, due to the loss\nof floodway capacity, is completely offset by the creation of equal floodway\nhydraulic capacity at that point. (3)\n\nThere shall be no placement of any mobile\nhomes within the adopted regulatory floodway. (c) When the administrator has identified\ncoastal high hazard areas on a city, town or village's FIRM, any State agency\nproposing to commence any project in a coastal high hazard area in such city, town or village shall do so only if it determines such project is in compliance\nwith the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe\nrequirements of paragraphs (1) through (10), inclusive, and paragraph (17) of\nsubdivision (a) of this section. (2)\n\nAll new structures shall be located\nlandward of the reach of mean high tide. (3)\n(i) All\nnew structures and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be\nelevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns, and securely anchored to\nsuch pilings or columns, so that the lowest portion of the structural members\nof the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to not less\nthan one foot above the base flood level; (ii)\na professional engineer or architect\nlicensed to practice in New York State shall certify to said agency that the\nstructure is securely anchored to adequately anchored pilings or columns in\norder to withstand high velocity waters and hurricane wave wash; and\n(iii)\nthe requirements of subparagraphs (i)\nand (ii) of this paragraph shall not be applicable to temporary structures\nassociated with recreational uses, or to marine uses such as bridges, docks, jetties, piers, breakwaters or groins. (4)\n\nAll new structures and substantial\nimprovements of existing structures shall have the space below the lowest floor\nfree of obstructions or be constructed with breakaway walls intended to\ncollapse under stress without jeopardizing the structural support of the\nstructure, so that the impact on the structure by abnormally high tides or\nwind-driven water is minimized. Such temporarily enclosed space shall not be\nused for human habitation. (5)\n\nThere shall be no use of fill for structural support of structures. (6)\n\nThere shall be no placement of mobile\nhomes. (7)\n\nThere shall be no\nalteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage. (d) In order to prevent flood\ndamage to certain facilities that would result in serious danger to life and\nhealth, or widespread social or economic dislocation, none of the following new\nprojects shall be undertaken by any State agency within any levee-protected\narea unless the entire project or, where applicable, the lowest floor of such\nproject, is elevated to at least one foot above the base flood level: (1)\nfacilities designed for bulk storage of\nchemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances or floatable\nmaterials; (2)\nhospitals, rest\nhomes, correctional facilities, dormitories, patient care facilities; (3)\nmajor power generation, transmission or\nsubstation facilities, except for hydroelectric facilities; (4)\nmajor communications centers, such as\ncivil defense centers; (5)\nmajor\nemergency service facilities, such as central fire and police stations; or\n(6)\ntransportation facilities\nwhich provide a major access route to any facility listed in paragraphs (1)\nthrough (5) of this subdivision.
