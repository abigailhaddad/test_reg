  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1240.13 - Discipline for Misconduct in a Foreign Jurisdiction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon application by a\n\nCommittee containing proof that a person or firm covered by these Rules has\nbeen disciplined by a foreign jurisdiction, the Court shall direct that person\nor firm to demonstrate, on terms it deems just, why discipline should not be\nimposed in New York for the underlying misconduct. (b) The respondent may file an\naffidavit stating defenses to the imposition of discipline and raising any\nmitigating factors. Any or all of the following defenses may be raised: (1)\nthat the procedure in the\nforeign jurisdiction was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to\nconstitute a deprivation of due process; or\n(2)\nthat there was such an infirmity of\nproof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the clear conviction that\nthe Court could not, consistent with its duties, accept as final the finding in\nthe foreign jurisdiction as to the respondent's misconduct; or\n(3)\nthat the misconduct for\nwhich the respondent was disciplined in the foreign jurisdiction does not\nconstitute misconduct in New York. (c) After the respondent has had an\nopportunity to be heard, and upon review of the order entered by the foreign\njurisdiction, and the record of the proceeding in that jurisdiction, if such\nrecord or part thereof is submitted by a party and deemed relevant by the\n\nCourt, the Court may discipline the respondent for the misconduct committed in\nthe foreign jurisdiction unless it finds that the procedure in the foreign\njurisdiction deprived the respondent of due process of law, that there was\ninsufficient proof that the respondent committed the misconduct, or that the\nimposition of discipline would be unjust. (d) Any person or firm to whom these\n\nRules shall apply who has been disciplined in a foreign jurisdiction shall, within 30 days after such discipline is imposed, advise the appropriate Court\n(as described in section\n1240.7\n(a)(2)\nof\nthese Rules) and Committee of such discipline. Such notification shall be in\nwriting and shall be accompanied by any judgment, order or certificate\nmemorializing the discipline imposed. The person or firm shall thereafter\nprovide the Committee with any further documentation, transcripts or other\nmaterials the Committee shall deem necessary to further its\ninvestigation.
