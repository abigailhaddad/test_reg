  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 105.20 - Resident individual\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 605(b)(1)\n(a) General. An individual may be a resident of New York State for\npersonal income tax purposes, and taxable as a resident, even though such\nindividual would not be deemed a resident for other purposes. As used in this\n\nSubchapter, the term\nresident individual\nincludes: (1)\nall persons domiciled in New York State, subject to the exceptions set forth in subdivision (b) of this section; and\n(2)\nany individual (other than\nan individual in active service in the Armed Forces of the United States) who\nis not domiciled in New York State, but who maintains a permanent place of\nabode for substantially all of the taxable year (generally, the entire taxable\nyear disregarding small portions of such year) in New York State and spends in\nthe aggregate more than 183 days of the taxable year in New York\n\nState. (b) Certain persons not deemed residents although domiciled in New York\n\nState. Any person domiciled in New York State is a resident for\npersonal income tax purposes for a specific taxable year, unless for that year\nsuch person satisfies all three of the requirements in paragraph (1) or all\nthree requirements in paragraph (2) of this subdivision: (1)\n(i) such person maintains no permanent place of abode in New York State during such\nyear; (ii)\nsuch person maintains a\npermanent place of abode outside New York State during such entire year; and\n(iii)\nsuch person spends in the\naggregate not more than 30 days of the taxable year in New York State; or\n(2)\n(i) within any period of 548 consecutive days\nsuch person is present in a foreign country or countries for at least 450\ndays; (ii)\nduring such period of\n548 consecutive days such person is not present in New York State for more than\n90 days and does not maintain a permanent place of abode in New York State at\nwhich such person's spouse (unless such spouse is legally separated) or minor\nchildren are present for more than 90 days; and\n(iii)\nduring the nonresident portion of the\ntaxable year with or within which such period of 548 consecutive days begins\nand the nonresident portion of the taxable year with or within which such\nperiod of 548 consecutive days ends, such person is present in New York State\nfor a number of days which does not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio\nto 90 as the number of days contained in such portion of the taxable year bears\nto 548. As long as an individual who is domiciled in New York\n\nState continues to meet the requirements of either paragraph (1) or paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision, such individual will be considered a nonresident of\n\nNew York State for personal income tax purposes. However, where such individual\nfails to meet those conditions, such individual will be subject to New York\n\nState personal income tax as a resident. Where an individual domiciled in New\n\nYork State claims to be a nonresident for any taxable year (or portion\nthereof), the burden is upon such individual to show that such individual\nsatisfied the requirements set forth in paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. Example: B, a single individual, is domiciled in New York State. During the period July 2, 1988 through December 31, 1989 (a period of 548\nconsecutive days), B was present in a foreign country 463 days. During the above period, B was present in New York\n\nState a total of 50 days, 15 days during the period July 2, 1988 through\n\nDecember 31, 1988, and 35 days during 1989. Since B was present in a foreign\ncountry 463 days, B meets the requirements of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision. B also meets the requirements of subparagraph (ii) of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, because the total of 50 days B was present\nin this State during this 548 consecutive day period is less than the maximum\nof 90 days allowed. To ascertain whether B meets the requirements of\nsubparagraph (iii) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, B must determine if\nthe number of days present in New York State during the period July 2, 1988\nthrough December 31, 1988 exceeds the maximum allowed for the nonresident\nportion of the taxable year within which the 548 consecutive day period began. The maximum number of days B may be present in New York State during the period\n\nJuly 2, 1988 through December 31, 1988 is 30, determined by making the\nfollowing computation: 183 (number of days in the nonresident portion of\nthe taxable year)\n/\n548 × 90\n=\n30 (maximum number of days B may spend in New\n\nYork State during the period July 2, 1988 through December 31, 1988)\n\nSince B was present in New York State 15 days during\nthe period July 2, 1988 through December 31, 1988, B did not exceed the maximum\nof 30 days allowed for this period. Therefore, B meets the requirements of\nsubparagraph (iii) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision. Based on the information contained in this example, B\nmeets all the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision and would be\nconsidered a nonresident of New York State for income tax purposes during the\nperiod July 2, 1988 through December 31, 1989. Therefore, B would be required\nto file as a part-year resident of New York State for the taxable year 1988 and\nas a nonresident of New York State for the taxable year 1989. (c) Rules for\ndays within and without New York State. In counting the number of days\nspent within and without New York State, presence within New York State for any\npart of a calendar day constitutes a day spent within New York State, except\nthat such presence within New York State may be disregarded if such presence is\nsolely for the purpose of boarding a plane, ship, train or bus for travel to a\ndestination outside New York State, or while traveling through New York State\nto a destination outside New York State. Any person domiciled outside New York\n\nState who maintains a permanent place of abode within New York State during any\ntaxable year, and claims to be a nonresident, must keep and have available for\nexamination by the Department of Taxation and Finance adequate records to\nsubstantiate the fact that such person did not spend more than 183 days of such\ntaxable year within New York State. (d) Domicile. (1)\n\nDomicile, in general, is the place which\nan individual intends to be such individual's permanent home - the place to\nwhich such individual intends to return whenever such individual may be\nabsent. (2)\nA domicile once\nestablished continues until the individual in question moves to a new location\nwith the bona fide intention of making such individual's fixed and permanent\nhome there. No change of domicile results from a removal to a new location if\nthe intention is to remain there only for a limited time; this rule applies\neven though the individual may have sold or disposed of such individual's\nformer home. The burden is upon any person asserting a change of domicile to\nshow that the necessary intention existed. In determining an individual's\nintention in this regard, such individual's declarations will be given due\nweight, but they will not be conclusive if they are contradicted by such\nindividual's conduct. The fact that a person registers and votes in one place\nis important but not necessarily conclusive, especially if the facts indicate\nthat such individual did this merely to escape taxation. (3)\n\nDomicile is not dependent on citizenship; that is, an immigrant who has permanently established such immigrant's home in\n\nNew York State is domiciled here regardless of whether such immigrant has\nbecome a United States citizen or has applied for citizenship. However, a\n\nUnited States citizen will not ordinarily be deemed to have changed such\ncitizen's domicile by going to a foreign country unless it is clearly shown\nthat such citizen intends to remain there permanently. For example, a United\n\nStates citizen domiciled in New York State who goes abroad because of an\nassignment by such citizen's employer or for study, research or recreation, does not lose such citizen's New York State domicile unless it is clearly shown\nthat such citizen intends to remain abroad permanently and not to return. (See\nsubdivision (b) of this section for certain persons not deemed residents of New\n\nYork State for a specific taxable year although domiciled in New York\n\nState.)\n(4)\nA person can have only\none domicile. If a person has two or more homes, such person's domicile is the\none which such person regards and uses as such person's permanent home. In\ndetermining such person's intentions in this matter, the length of time\ncustomarily spent at each location is important but not necessarily conclusive. It should be noted however, as provided by paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of\nthis section, a person who maintains a permanent place of abode for\nsubstantially all of the taxable year in New York State and spends more than\n183 days of the taxable year in New York State is taxable as a resident even\nthough such person may be domiciled elsewhere. (5)\n(i) Husband and wife. Generally, the domicile of a husband and wife are the same. However, if they are separated in fact, they may each, under some\ncircumstances, acquire their own separate domiciles even though there is no\njudgment or decree of separation. Where there is a judgment or decree of\nseparation, a husband and wife may acquire their own separate\ndomicile. (ii)\n\nChildren. A child's\ndomicile ordinarily follows that of such child's parents, until such child\nreaches the age of self-support and actually establishes his or her own\nseparate domicile. Where the mother and father have separate domiciles, the\ndomicile of the child is generally the domicile of the parent with whom such\nchild lives for the major portion of the year. The domicile of a child for whom\na guardian has been appointed is determined by the facts and circumstances of\nthe situation and is not necessarily determined by the domicile of the\nguardian. (6)\n\nMembers of\nthe Armed Forces. Section 514 of the Federal Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil\n\nRelief Act of 1940, as amended, (\n50 U.S.C. App\nx. § 574) provides that for\npurposes of taxation, an individual in the Armed Forces of the United States is\nnot deemed to have lost such individual's domicile in any state solely by\nreason of being absent therefrom in compliance with military orders. Thus, such\n\nFederal law insures that an individual in the Armed Forces of the United States\ndomiciled in New York State would not be deemed a domiciliary for income tax\npurposes in another state in which such individual is stationed. On the other\nhand, an individual in the Armed Forces of the United States domiciled in\nanother state who is stationed in New York State would not be deemed a\ndomiciliary, for personal income tax purposes, of New York State. The rule is, generally speaking, that the domicile of a person is in no way affected by\nservice in the Armed Forces of the United States. A change of domicile has to\nbe shown by facts which objectively manifest a voluntary intention to make the\nnew location a domicile. It is possible for an individual in the Armed Forces\nof the United States to change such individual's domicile; however, the\nrequisite intent is difficult to prove. (e) Permanent place of abode. (1)\nA\npermanent place of\nabode\nmeans a dwelling place of a permanent nature maintained by the\ntaxpayer, whether or not owned by such taxpayer, and will generally include a\ndwelling place owned or leased by such taxpayer's spouse. However, a mere camp\nor cottage, which is suitable and used only for vacations, is not a permanent\nplace of abode. Furthermore, a barracks or any construction which does not\ncontain facilities ordinarily found in a dwelling, such as facilities for\ncooking, bathing, etc., will generally not be deemed a permanent place of\nabode. A dwelling place maintained by a full-time student enrolled at an\ninstitution of higher education, as defined in section\n606 (t)(3)\nof the Tax Law, in an undergraduate degree program leading to a baccalaureate degree, and\noccupied by the student while attending the institution is not a permanent\nplace of abode with respect to that student. A\nfull-time\nstudent\nis an individual who is carrying a minimum courseload in such\nprogram of 12 credit hours per semester for at least two semesters, or the\nequivalent, during the individual's taxable year. (2)\n\nThe determination of whether an\nindividual in the Armed Forces of the United States maintains a permanent place\nof abode outside New York State is not dependent merely upon whether such\nindividual lives on or off a military base. This is only one of many factors to\nbe considered in determining whether a permanent place of abode is being\nmaintained outside New York State. Some of the other factors include the type\nand location of quarters occupied by such individual and members of such\nindividual's immediate family and how and by whom such quarters are maintained. Barracks, bachelor officers' quarters, quarters assigned on vessels, etc., generally do not qualify as permanent places of abode maintained by an\nindividual in the Armed Forces of the United States. Further, the maintenance\nof a place of abode by an individual in the Armed Forces of the United States\noutside New York State will not be considered permanent if it is maintained\nonly during a duty assignment of a limited or temporary nature.
