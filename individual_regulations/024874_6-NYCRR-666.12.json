  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 666.12 - Preservation of water quality\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following water quality standards will apply: (a) In wild river areas: (1)\nnew discharges of any substances are\nprohibited; and\n(2)\nupon its\ndesignation by the Legislature, the water quality classification of the river\nwill be evaluated by the department and consideration will be given to\nreclassifying the river to Class N pursuant to Part 609 of this Title if this\nis not the present classification. If a Class N classification is not\napplicable, the most restrictive classification appropriate, considering future\nuses of the river, will be applied. Such evaluation will be accomplished as\npart of the boundary setting process under section\n666.6\nof this Part. (b) In scenic and recreational\nriver areas: (1)\nnew discharges from point\nsources are not allowed unless the applicant shows that such discharge will not\nhave a detrimental impact on river area resources; and\n(2)\nupon its designation by the Legislature, the water quality classification for a river will be evaluated by the\ndepartment and a consideration given to reclassification to the most\nrestrictive classification appropriate, considering river corridor resources\nidentified in the statewide rivers inventory, designation study report and\nfinal corridor boundary study, as well as future uses of the river and river\narea which are allowable. Such evaluation will be accomplished as part of the\nboundary setting process under section\n666.6\nof this Part. (c) Existing discharges from point\nsources will be minimized or eliminated. (d) Stormwater runoff from point and nonpoint\nsources will be controlled and managed by the department as follows: (1)\nplans are required for all nonpoint\nsources and will be designed to minimize pollutant discharges within the river\narea; (2)\nstormwater runoff from a\nnew development will not exceed pre-developmental (natural) conditions; and\n(3)\nstormwater runoff must be\nmanaged to the extent practicable within each newly created lot. Development\nplans must provide for control of the first one half inch of runoff from all\ndisturbed and otherwise developed areas. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
