(a) Except as provided for in subdivision (b) of this section, all proposals for\nthe listing of properties on both the National Register and State Register\nshall be submitted, reviewed and acted upon in accordance with the regulations\ngoverning the National Register (  36 CFR\n1202\n), including any amendments to\nthese regulations and any regulations which shall subsequently take the place\nof these regulations. (b) At\ncertain points in the listing process, the statutory requirements for the two\nregisters are different. In these instances, and only in these instances, the\nprocedures for listing a property on the National Register and those for\nlisting it on the State Register shall be followed separately. The procedures\nwhich the commissioner shall follow for listing a property on the State\n\nRegister that differ from National Register procedures are as follows: (1)\n\nThose regulations which prohibit listing\non the National Register when property owners object shall not apply to\nnominations for the State Register. (2)\n\nNotice of a proposed listing on the State\n\nRegister and the provision of a comment period shall be made in accordance with\nthe provisions of section\n427.4\nof this\n\nPart. (3)\nA decision on listing a\nproperty on the State Register shall be made no later than 180 days from\nreceipt of the nomination and sufficient supporting documentation in accordance\nwith the provisions of section\n427.5\n(b) of this Part. (4)\n\nAny statutory\nprovision or other procedure established subsequent to the effective date of\nthis Part for listing a property on the National Register which differs from\nthe New York State Historic Preservation Act of 1980 or the provisions of this\n\nPart shall not apply to listings on the State Register. (c) On the date that the commissioner signs a\nnomination for listing on the National Register, the property will be listed on\nthe State Register, and all benefits and protections of listing shall accrue in\nfull force and effect from that date. Following the listing of a property on\nthe State Register, the commissioner shall provide notification as required in\nsection\n427.5\n(d) of this Part. (d) If a property is\nwithdrawn from consideration for nomination to the National Register due to the\nrecommendation of a local historic preservation commission or municipal\nofficial, or because the property owner has filed an objection to the listing, it will continue to be considered for listing on the State Register according\nto the provisions of section\n427.5\nof this\n\nPart.
