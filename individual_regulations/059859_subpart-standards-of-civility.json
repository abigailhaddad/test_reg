Standards of Civility - Standards of Civility\n\nState Regulations\n§ 1 - General Standards\n§ 2 - Standards for Transactional/non-litigation Settings\nPREAMBLE\nThe New York State Standards of Civility\nfor the legal profession set forth principles of behavior to which the bar, the\nbench and court employees should aspire. (The term \"court\" as used herein also\nmay refer to any other tribunal, as appropriate.) They are not intended as\nrules to be enforced by sanction or disciplinary action, nor are they intended\nto supplement or modify the Rules Governing Judicial Conduct, the Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct or any other applicable rule or requirement governing\nconduct. Instead they are a set of guidelines intended to encourage lawyers, judges and court personnel to observe principles of civility and decorum, and\nto confirm the legal profession's rightful status as an honorable and respected\nprofession where courtesy and civility are observed as a matter of course. The Standards of Civility are divided into\ntwo main sections, one that is generally applicable but also contains a number\nof it ems specifically directed to the litigation setting, and one that is more\nspecifically directed to transactional and other non-litigation settings. The\nfirst section, in turn, is divided into four parts: lawyers' duties to other\nlawyers, litigants [and], witnesses and others; lawyers' duties to the court\nand court personnel; court's duties to lawyers, parties and witnesses; and\ncourt personnel's duties to lawyers and litigants. There is also a Statement of\n\nClient's Rights appended to the Standards of Civility. As lawyers, judges, court employees and\nofficers of the court, and as attorneys generally, we are all essential\nparticipants in the judicial process. That process cannot work effectively to\nserve the public unless we first treat each other with courtesy, respect and\ncivility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 22, subtit. B, ch. IV, subch.
