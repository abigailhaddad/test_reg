  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 171.4 - Determining New York State personal income tax to be withheld\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The amount of New York State\npersonal income tax to be deducted and withheld by an employer must be\ndetermined in accordance with one of the following withholding methods: Method I - Wage Bracket Table Method\n\nMethod II - Exact Calculation Method\n\nMethod III - Top Income Tax Rates Method\n\nIn case of special situations, however, an employer may\napply to the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance for permission to use another\nmethod. The wage bracket table method, the exact calculation method, and the\ntop income tax rates method are set out in Appendix 10 of this Title The New\n\nYork State tax tables and methods, along with forms, instructions and other\nguidance for withholding, payment and reporting of the New York State personal\nincome tax are available on the Tax Department's Web site. For the rules for\ndetermining the New York State personal income tax to be withheld on\nsupplemental wages and other rules applicable in determining the proper amount\nof New York State personal income tax to be withheld, see the succeeding\nsubdivisions of this section. (b) Supplemental wages. (1)\n\nGeneral. Where supplemental wages (such\nas bonuses, commissions, overtime pay, sales awards or tips) are paid at the\nsame time as regular wages, the New York State personal income tax to be\ndeducted and withheld should be determined as if the total of the supplemental\nand regular wages were a single wage payment for the regular payroll period. Where supplemental wages are paid at a different time, an employer may\ndetermine the New York State personal income tax to be withheld by adding the\nsupplemental wages either to the regular wages for the current payroll period\nor to the regular wages for the last preceding payroll period within the same\ncalendar year. However, if New York State personal income tax has been withheld\nfrom an employee's regular wages, an employer may withhold New York State\npersonal income tax from the supplemental wages at a rate equal to the rate of\n\nNew York State personal income tax to be withheld from the highest denominated\ntaxable income applicable to withholding from salaries and wages (e.g., 11.70\npercent for supplemental wages paid after December 31, 2021), without any\nallowance for withholding exemptions. (2)\n\nVacation allowances. Amounts of so-called\nvacation allowances are subject to withholding as though they were regular wage\npayments made for the period covered by the vacation. If the vacation allowance\nis paid in addition to the regular wage payment for such period, the rules\napplicable with respect to supplemental wage payments apply to such vacation\nallowance. (c) Payroll\nperiods. The New York State personal income tax is to be withheld on the basis\nof the same payroll period which is required to be used by the employer for\n\nFederal income tax purposes. (d) Withholding exemptions. (1)\n\nIn determining\nthe proper New York State personal income tax to be deducted and withheld from\nan employee's wages, an employee is entitled to the same number of withholding\nexemptions as the number of New York exemptions such employee is allowed\npursuant to section\n616\nof the Tax Law plus such additional New\n\nYork State withholding allowances in accordance with forms and instructions of\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance (see form IT-2104, Employee's\n\nWithholding Allowance Certificate and Instructions). In lieu of New York State\nform IT-2104, an employer may accept a properly completed Federal form W-4 from\nan employee. (2)\n\nIf an employee has\nnot filed a Federal form W-4, or if an employee wishes to claim withholding\nexemptions other than those claimed for Federal income tax withholding\npurposes, the employer must obtain a completed Employee's Withholding Allowance\n\nCertificate (form IT-2104) from the employee. Such employee shall be entitled\nto claim only those withholding exemptions allowable on a properly completed\n\nEmployee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form IT-2104). (3)\n\nIf an employer is notified by the\n\nInternal Revenue Service that a Federal form W-4 for an employee is defective, then the number of exemptions allowable for New York State personal income tax\nwithholding purposes for that employee shall be limited to the maximum number\nof withholding exemptions specified by the Internal Revenue Service in the\nwritten notice received from such service, less withholding allowances based on\nentitlement to Federal credits, plus the number of additional New York State\nwithholding allowances claimed on a properly completed Employee's Withholding\n\nAllowance Certificate (form IT-2104). (4)\n\nSubmission of certain Employee's\n\nWithholding Allowance Certificates (form IT-2104). (i) General rule. An employer shall submit, in accordance with subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, a copy of any\n\nEmployee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form IT-2104), together with a\ncopy of any written statement received from the employee in support of the\nclaims made on the certificate, which is received from the employee during a\nreporting period, except for the first submission under clause (ii)(c) of this\nparagraph, if the employee is employed by that employer on the last day of the\nreporting period and if the total number of withholding exemptions and\nallowances claimed on the Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form\nIT-2104) exceeds 14. (ii)\n\nRules for\nsubmission. (a) In general.

In\nsuch case, the employer is to submit the copies of the Employee's Withholding\n\nAllowance Certificates (forms IT-2104) to the New York State Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, Income Tax Audit Administrator - Withholding Certificate\n\nCoordinator, Building 9, W.A.

This request of the Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay relate either to one or more named employees or to one or more reasonably\nsegregable units of the employer. (iv)\n\nComputation of New York State personal\nincome tax to be withheld. (a) Until receipt\nof written notice from the Department of Taxation and Finance that an\n\nEmployee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form IT-2104) which has been\nsubmitted in accordance with this paragraph is defective, that certificate\nshall remain in effect and the employer shall withhold on the basis of the\nstatements made in that certificate, unless such certificate must be\ndisregarded under the provisions of clause (f) of this subparagraph. (b) The Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay find that a copy of an Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form\nIT-2104) which has been submitted contains a materially incorrect statement, or\nit may determine, after written request to the employee for verification of the\nstatements on the certificate, that the certificate lacks sufficient\ninformation to determine if the certificate is correct. If the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance so finds or determines, and notifies the employer in\nwriting that the certificate is defective, the employer must then consider the\n\nEmployee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form IT-2104) to be defective for\npurposes of computing the amount of New York State personal income tax to be\nwithheld. (c) If the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance notifies the employer that an Employee's Withholding\n\nAllowance Certificate (form IT-2104) is defective, the Department of Taxation\nand Finance will, based on its findings, advise the employer that the employee\nis not entitled to claim a total number of withholding exemptions and\nallowances in excess of a number specified by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance in the notice. (d) The\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance will provide the employer with a copy for\nthe employee of each notice it furnishes to the employer under this\nsubparagraph, in addition to the notice furnished to the employer for such\nemployer's own use. The Department of Taxation and Finance shall also mail a\nsimilar notice to the employee at the address of the employee as shown on the\n\nEmployee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form IT-2104) under\nreview.

The employer must\nwithhold amounts of New York State personal income tax from the employee on the\nbasis of the maximum number specified in the written notice received from the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (f) If and when the employee does file a new\n\nEmployee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form IT-2104), after an earlier\ncertificate of the employee was considered to be defective, the employer shall\nwithhold on the basis of that new certificate (whenever filed) as currently\neffective only if the new certificate does not make a claim of a number of\nwithholding exemptions, which claim is greater than the number earlier\nfurnished by the Department of Taxation and Finance in its written notice to\nthe employer. If the new certificate does make a claim which is greater than\nthe number contained in the Department of Taxation and Finance's written notice\nto the employer, then the employer shall disregard the new Employee's\n\nWithholding Allowance Certificate (form IT-2104), shall not submit that new\ncertificate to the Department of Taxation and Finance, and shall continue to\nwithhold amounts of New York State personal income tax from the employee on the\nbasis of the maximum number specified in the written notice received from the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (g) If the employee makes a claim of a number\nof withholding exemptions on a new Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate\n(form IT-2104) that is greater than the number contained in the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance's written notice to the employer, the employee may specify\non such new certificate, or by a written statement attached to that\ncertificate, any circumstances of the employee which have changed since the\ndate of the Department of Taxation and Finance's earlier written notice, or any\nother circumstances or reasons, as justification or support for the claims made\nby the employee on the new Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form\nIT-2104).

Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227, or to (2) the employer, who must then submit a copy of that new\ncertificate and the employee's written statement (if any) to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. The employer shall continue to disregard that new\ncertificate and shall continue to withhold amounts of New York State personal\nincome tax from the employee on the basis of the maximum number specified in\nthe written notice received from the Department of Taxation and Finance unless\nand until the Department of Taxation and Finance by written notice advises the\nemployer to withhold amounts of New York State personal income tax on the basis\nof that new Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (form IT-2104) and\nrevokes its earlier written notice. (h) For purposes of this paragraph, the term\nemployer includes anyone who is authorized by the employer to receive\n\nEmployee's Withholding Allowance Certificates (form IT-2104), to make\nwithholding computations, or to make payroll distributions.
