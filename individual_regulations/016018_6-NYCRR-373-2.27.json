(b) A first attempt at repair shall be made\nno later than five calendar days after the emission is detected. (c) Delay of repair of a closed-vent system\nfor which leaks have been detected is allowed if the repair is technically\ninfeasible without a process unit shutdown, or if the owner or operator\ndetermines that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be greater than\nthe fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair.

(15)\n\nAny\ncomponents of a closed-vent system that are designated, as described in\nsubparagraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section, as unsafe to monitor are exempt from\nthe requirements of subclause (12)(i)(\nb\n)(\n2\n)\nof this subdivision if: (i) The owner or\noperator of the closed-vent system determines that the components of the\nclosed-vent system are unsafe to monitor because monitoring personnel would be\nexposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying with subclause\n(12)(i)(\nb\n)(\n2\n) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nThe owner or operator of the closed-vent\nsystem adheres to a written plan that requires monitoring the closed-vent\nsystem components using the procedure specified in subclause\n(12)(i)(\nb\n)(\n2\n) of this subdivision as\nfrequently as practicable during safe-to-monitor times. (e) Test methods\nand procedures. (1)\n\nEach owner or\noperator subject to the provisions of this section shall comply with the test\nmethods and procedures requirements provided in this subdivision. (2)\n\nWhen a closed-vent system is tested for\ncompliance with no detectable emissions, as required in paragraph (d)(12) of\nthis section, the test shall comply with the following requirements: (i) Monitoring shall comply with Reference\n\nMethod 21 in 40 CFR part\n60\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (ii)\n\nThe detection\ninstrument shall meet the performance criteria of Reference Method\n21. (iii)\n\nThe instrument shall be\ncalibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in\n\nReference Method 21. (iv)\n\nCalibration gases shall be: (a) zero air\n(less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); (b) a mixture of methane or n-hexane and air\nat a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppm methane or\nn-hexane.

(vii)\n\nThe arithmetic difference between the\nmaximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level is\ncompared with 500 ppm for determining compliance. (3)\n\nPerformance tests to determine compliance\nwith paragraph (c)(1) of this section and with the total organic compound\nconcentration limit of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall comply with the\nfollowing: (i) Performance tests to determine\ntotal organic compound concentrations and mass flow rates entering and exiting\ncontrol devices shall be conducted and data reduced in accordance with the\nfollowing reference methods and calculation procedures: (a) Method 2 in 40 CFR part\n60\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) for velocity and volumetric flow rate. (b) Method 18 or Method 25A in 40 CFR part\n60\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) for organic content. If Method 25A is used, the organic HAP used as the\ncalibration gas must be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent\nby volume of the emissions. The use of Method 25A is acceptable if the response\nfrom the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation\nof the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on\nthe most sensitive scale. (c) Each\nperformance test shall consist of three separate runs; each run conducted for\nat least one hour under the conditions that exist when the hazardous waste\nmanagement unit is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably\nexpected to occur. For the purpose of determining total organic compound\nconcentrations and mass flow rates, the average of results of all runs shall\napply. The average shall be computed on a time- weighted basis. (d) Total organic mass flow rates shall be\ndetermined by the following equation: (1)\n\nFor\nsources utilizing Method 18. E\nh\n= Q\n2sd\n×- (summation\n{i=1 to n}\n(C\ni\nMW\ni\n)) ×- (0.0416)\n×- (10\n-6\n) where: E\nh\n= Total organic mass flow rate, kg/h; Q\n2sd\n= Volumetric flow rate of\ngases entering or exiting control device, as determined by Method 2, dscm/h; n = Number of organic compounds in the vent gas; C\ni\n= Organic concentration in\nppm, dry basis, of compound I in the vent gas, as determined by Method\n18; MW\ni\n= Molecular weight or organic\ncompound i in the vent gas, kg/kg-mol; 0.0416 = Conversion factor for molar volume, kg-mol/m\n3\n(at 293 K and 760 mm Hg); 10\n-6\n= Conversion from ppm, ppm\n-1. (2)\n\nFor sources utilizing Method 25A. E\nh\n=\n(Q)(C)(MW)(0.0416)(10\n-6\n)\nwhere: E\nh\n= Total organic mass flow rate, kg/h; Q = Volumetric flow rate of gases entering or exiting\ncontrol device, as determined by Method 2, dscm/h; C = Organic concentration in ppm, dry basis, as\ndetermined by Method 25A; MW = Molecular weight of propane, 44; 0.0416 = conversion factor for molar volume, kg\nmol/m\n3\n(at 293 K and 760 mm Hg); 10\n-6\n= Conversion from\nppm. (e) The\nannual total organic emission rate shall be determined by the following\nequation: E\nA\n= (E\nh\n)\n(H)\nwhere: E\nA\n= Total organic mass emission\nrate, kg/y; E\nh\n= Total organic mass flow rate\nfor the process vent, kg/h; H = Total annual hours of operations for the affected\nunit, h. (f) Total organic\nemissions from all affected process vents at the facility shall be determined\nby summing the hourly total organic mass emission rates\n(E\nh\nas determined in clause [i][\nd\n] of\nthis paragraph) and by summing the annual total organic mass emission rates\n(E\nA, as determined in clause [i][\ne\n] of\nthis paragraph) for all affected process vents at the facility. (ii)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of an affected facility shall record such process information as may\nbe necessary to determine the conditions of the performance tests. Operations\nduring periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute\nrepresentative conditions for the purpose of a performance test. (iii)\n\nThe owner or operator of an affected\nfacility shall provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities\nas follows: (a) Sampling ports adequate for\nthe test methods specified in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (b) Safe sampling platform(s). (c) Safe access to sampling\nplatform(s). (d) Utilities for\nsampling and testing equipment. (iv)\n\nFor the purpose of making compliance\ndeterminations, the time-weighted average of the results of the three runs\nshall apply. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions\noccur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced\nshutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme\nmeteorological conditions, or other circumstances beyond the owner's or\noperator's control, compliance may, upon the commissioner's approval, be\ndetermined using the average of the results of the two other runs. (4)\n\nTo show that a\nprocess vent associated with a hazardous waste distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or stream stripping operation\nis not subject to the requirements of this section, the owner or operator must\nmake an initial determination that the time-weighted, annual average total\norganic concentration of the waste managed by the waste management unit is less\nthan 10 ppmw using one of the following two methods: (i) Direct measurement of the organic\nconcentration of the waste using the following procedures: (a) The owner or operator must take a minimum\nof four grab samples of waste for each waste stream managed in the affected\nunit under process conditions expected to cause the maximum waste organic\nconcentration. (b) For waste\ngenerated onsite, the grab samples must be collected at a point before the\nwaste is exposed to the atmosphere such as in an enclosed pipe or other closed\nsystem that is used to transfer the waste after generation to the first\naffected distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent\nextraction, or air or steam stripping operation. For waste generated offsite, the grab samples must be collected at the inlet to the first waste management\nunit that receives the waste provided the waste has been transferred to the\nfacility in a closed system such as a tank truck and the waste is not diluted\nor mixed with other waste. (c) Each\nsample shall be analyzed and the total organic concentration of the sample\nshall be computed using Method 9060A of SW-846 (incorporated by reference under\nsection\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), or analyzed for its individual organic constituents. (d) The arithmetic mean of the results of the\nanalyses of the four samples shall apply for each waste stream managed in the\nunit in determining the time-weighted, annual average total organic\nconcentration of the waste. The time-weighted average is to be calculated using\nthe annual quantity of each waste stream processed and the mean organic\nconcentration of each waste stream managed in the unit. (ii)\n\nUsing knowledge of the waste to\ndetermine that its total organic concentration is less than 10 ppmw. Documentation of the waste determination is required. Examples of documentation\nthat shall be used to support a determination under this provision include\nproduction process information documenting that no organic compounds are used, information that the waste is generated by a process that is identical to a\nprocess at the same or another facility that has previously been demonstrated\nby direct measurement to generate a waste stream having a total organic content\nless than 10 ppmw, or prior speciation analysis results on the same waste\nstream where it can also be documented that no process changes have occurred\nsince that analysis that could affect the waste total organic\nconcentration. (5)\n\nThe\ndetermination that distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent\nextraction, or air or stream stripping operations manage hazardous wastes with\ntime-weighted, annual average total organic concentrations less than 10 ppmw\nshall be made as follows: (i) by the\neffective date that the facility becomes subject to the provisions of this\nsection or by the date when the waste is first managed in a waste management\nunit, whichever is later; and\n(ii)\nfor continuously generated waste, annually; or\n(iii)\nwhenever there is a change in the waste\nbeing managed or a change in the process that generates or treats the\nwaste. (6)\n\nWhen an owner\nor operator and the department do not agree on whether a distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam\nstripping operation manages a hazardous waste with organic concentrations of at\nleast 10 ppmw based on knowledge of the waste, the dispute may be resolved by\nusing direct measurement as specified at subparagraph (4)(i) of this\nsubdivision. (f) Recordkeeping requirements. (1)\n(i) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this section shall comply\nwith the recordkeeping requirements of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nAn owner or operator of more than one\nhazardous waste management unit subject to the provisions of this section may\ncomply with the recordkeeping requirements for these hazardous waste management\nunits in one recordkeeping system if the system identifies each record by each\nhazardous waste management unit. (2)\n\nOwners and operators must record the\nfollowing information in the facility operating record: (i) For facilities that comply with the\nprovisions of subparagraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, an implementation\nschedule that includes dates by which the closed-vent system and control device\nwill be installed and in operation. The schedule must also include a rationale\nof why the installation cannot be completed at an earlier date. The\nimplementation schedule must be in the facility operating record by the\neffective date that the facility becomes subject to the provisions of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nUp-to-date\ndocumentation of compliance with the process vent standards in subdivision (c)\nof this section, including: (a) Information\nand data identifying all affected process vents, annual throughput and\noperating hours of each affected unit, estimated emission rates for each\naffected vent and for the overall facility (\ni.e., the total\nemissions for all affected vents at the facility), and the approximate location\nwithin the facility of each affected unit (\ne.g., identify the\nhazardous waste management units on a facility plot plan). (b) Information and data supporting\ndeterminations of vent emissions and emission reductions achieved by add-on\ncontrol devices based on engineering calculations or source tests. For the\npurpose of determining compliance, determinations of vent emissions and\nemission reductions must be made using operating parameter values\n(\ne.g., temperatures, flow rates, or vent stream organic\ncompounds and concentrations) that represent the conditions that result in\nmaximum organic emissions, such as when the waste management unit is operating\nat the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected to occur. If the\nowner or operator takes any action (\ne.g., managing a waste of\ndifferent composition or increasing operating hours of affected waste\nmanagement units) that would result in an increase in total organic emissions\nfrom affected process vents at the facility, then a new determination is\nrequired. (iii)\n\nWhere an\nowner or operator chooses to use test data to determine the organic removal\nefficiency or total organic compound concentration achieved by the control\ndevice, a performance test plan. The test plan must include: (a) A description of how it is determined\nthat the planned test is going to be conducted when the hazardous waste\nmanagement unit is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably\nexpected to occur. This shall include the estimated or design flow rate and\norganic content of each vent stream and define the acceptable operating ranges\nof key process and control device parameters during the test program.
