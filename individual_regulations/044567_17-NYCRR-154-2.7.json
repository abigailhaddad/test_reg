Tit. 17 §§ 154-2.7 - Financial responsibility\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn order to protect the State of New York, the various\npolitical subdivisions thereof, and the public, every holder of a divisible\nload permit shall meet the insurance requirements described in this\nsection. (a) Liability insurance\ncoverage. Every holder of a divisible load permit shall procure and maintain a\npolicy of liability insurance coverage from a company duly authorized to\ntransact business in this State. Such insurance policy shall provide for\nliability arising from the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of each\nvehicle for which a divisible load permit is granted and shall provide for at\nleast the following liability coverage. (1)\nfor bodily injury to or death of one or more persons in any one accident, $750,000 and for injury to or destruction of property in any one accident, $250,000; or\n(2)\na combined single\nlimit for any one accident, $1,000,000. (b) Certification. Each applicant for a\ndivisible load permit shall certify to the department the following: (1)\nthat the applicant has obtained insurance\ncoverage with the minimum coverage specified in this section; (2)\nthat the applicant will not operate or\nallow to be operated any permitted vehicle unless the required insurance\ncovering such vehicle is in effect; (3)\nthat the operation of a vehicle without\nthe insurance required by this section being in effect constitutes grounds for\nthe revocation of the permit as well as other applicable civil and criminal\npenalties; and\n(4)\nthat upon\nrequest such applicant will provide evidence issued by or on behalf of an\ninsurance company duly authorized to transact business in this State that an\ninsurance policy meeting the requirements of this Subpart is or has been in\neffect for all such time as the permit has been granted. The department shall not issue, amend or renew a\ndivisible load permit to any applicant who has not provided this certification\nto the department. (c) Proof of insurance. The commissioner may\nrequire from each applicant, prior to issuing a divisible load permit, a\ncertificate of insurance, as that term in defined in section\n311\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law, showing that there is a liability insurance policy\nin effect meeting the minimum requirements specified in this section. (d) Permit revocation. The commissioner may\nrevoke any divisible load permit when an insurance policy meeting the\nrequirements of this section has been cancelled without corresponding evidence\nthat a replacement policy also meeting the requirements of this section has\nbeen issued. (e) Audit. The\ncommissioner may investigate or audit any holder of a divisible load permit\nwith respect to compliance with the provisions of this section. Failure of a\npermit holder to cooperate in any such investigation or failure to provide\nwithin a reasonable time such records as the commissioner may reasonably\nrequire to investigate the permit holder's compliance with the provisions of\nthis section shall constitute grounds for the suspension or revocation of the\ndivisible load permit. (f) Municipalities. A self-insured municipality may furnish, in lieu of the\ninsurance certificate, a self-insurance indemnification agreement in a form\nprescribed by the Department of Transportation. (g) Waiver. The commissioner may waive any of\nthe provisions contained in this section when special conditions\nwarrant. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
