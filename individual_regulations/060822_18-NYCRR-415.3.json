  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 415.3 - Caretaker's responsibilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An applicant for child care assistance\nmust apply, in writing, on forms and in a manner prescribed by the social\nservices district in accordance with Part 404 of this Title. The social\nservices district must permit the applicant to submit an application by mail, or other electronic means as approved by the Office. The caretaker with whom an\neligible child or children lives is the applicant for such services. (b) The applicant is responsible for\nproviding accurate, complete and current information regarding family income\nand composition, child care arrangements and any other circumstances related to\nthe family's eligibility for child care services, and for notifying the social\nservices district immediately of any changes in such information. (c) The child(ren)'s caretaker is responsible\nfor locating a child care provider(s) that meets the needs of his or her\nchild(ren). A caretaker that is unable to locate a child care provider(s) may\nask the social services district for assistance. (d) A family which chooses to have a\ncaregiver of informal child care provide child care services in the\nchild(ren)'s own home must provide such caregiver with all employment benefits\nrequired by State and/or Federal law and pay the caregiver at least minimum\nwage, if required by State and/or Federal law. (e) Family share. (1)\n\nEach family receiving child care\nassistance must contribute toward the costs of child care services by paying a\nfamily share based upon the family's income with the following exceptions: a\nfamily where the parent(s) or caretaker relative(s) is receiving public\nassistance, a family experiencing homelessness, when such assistance is\nprovided to a child in foster care, when such assistance is provided to a child\nas a protective or preventive service, or when such assistance is provided to a\nchild where the child care services unit is comprised of the eligible\nchild(ren) only. However, a family share may be required of any family to\nrecoup an overpayment for child care services. (2)\n\nThe income-based portion of the family\nshare for child care services must be determined by the social services\ndistrict in accordance with a sliding fee scale developed pursuant to paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision. The overpayment portion of the family share, if any, must be reflected separately from any income-based portion of the family share\nand must be determined in accordance with section\n415.4\n(i) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nThe sliding fee scale\ndeveloped by the social services district must be calculated by subtracting the\nstate income standard, as defined in section\n415.1\n(k) of this\n\nPart, for the specific family size of the eligible family from the annual gross\nincome of the eligible family, multiplying the remaining income by a factor of\nat least 1 but no more than 10 percent, as selected by the social services\ndistrict and included in the district's consolidated services plan or\nintegrated county plan, and dividing the product by 52 to determine a weekly\nfamily share. The same percentage factor must be used for all families\nreceiving child care services that are required to pay an income-based portion\nof a family share. (4)\nA minimum\nweekly family share of $1 must be charged to each family receiving child care\nservices which is required to pay an income-based portion of a family\nshare. (5)\n\nEach family receiving\nchild care services is responsible for paying only one family share regardless\nof the number of children in the family who are receiving child care\nservices. (6)\n\nThe family is\nresponsible for paying the family share in the manner determined by the social\nservices district. The social services district may require the family to pay\nthe family share to the social services district or to one or more child care\nproviders used by the family. (7)\n\nThe family share will be recalculated by the social services district whenever\nthere is a change in income, household circumstances or child care provider\nthat would decrease the amount of the family share, when an overpayment for\nchild care services has occurred and the recovery of such overpayment will be\nmade through the family share, and at recertification. (8)\n\nThe failure of a family receiving child\ncare services to pay the family share for such services established by the\nsocial services district or to cooperate with such district to develop an\narrangement satisfactory to the district to make full payment of all delinquent\nfamily shares constitutes an appropriate basis for suspending or terminating\nsuch child care services in accordance with the procedures set forth in section\n404.6\nof this\n\nTitle. (f) A caretaker\nseeking child care services to enable the caretaker to participate in an\napproved training program must provide documentation that includes, but is not\nlimited to, the following: (1)\nthe name of the\ninstitution offering or conducting the training program; (2)\nthe course of study to be pursued or in\nwhich the person is participating; (3)\nthe specific vocational or rehabilitative\ngoal; (4)\nthe duration of the\ntraining (hours per day) including no more than a total of three hours per day\nto commute (from home) to and from training location; and\n(5)\nprogress reports (marks, transcripts, letters, and like documents) which indicate that the caretaker is progressing\nsatisfactorily towards attaining the established vocational or rehabilitative\ngoal. (g) The child's\ncaretaker is responsible for responding to and providing documentation\nrequested for an investigation, audit, or program review by a social services\ndistrict, the Office, or other authorized agency to verify the accuracy and\ncompleteness of information on the application including, but not limited to, household circumstances, need for child care, and compliance with the\ncaretaker's responsibilities under this section. The caretaker's failure to\nrespond to or comply with requests for documentation constitutes an appropriate\nbasis for the social services district to deny an application for child care\nassistance or to close the child care assistance case in accordance with\n415.2(d)(4).
