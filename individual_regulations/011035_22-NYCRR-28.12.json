  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 28.12 - Trial de novo\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Demand may be made by any party not in default for a trial de novo in the court\nwhere the action was commenced or, if the action was transferred, the court to\nwhich it was transferred, with or without a jury. Any party who is not in\ndefault, within 30 days after service upon such party of the notice of filing\nof the award with the appropriate court clerk, or if service is by mail, within\n35 days of such service, may file with the clerk of the court where the award\nwas filed and serve upon all adverse parties a demand for a trial de\nnovo. (b) If the\ndemandant either serves or files a timely demand for a trial de novo but\nneglects through mistake or excusable neglect to do one of those two acts\nwithin the time limited, the court where the action was commenced or, if the\naction was transferred, the court to which it was transferred, may grant an\nextension of time for curing the omission. (c) The demandant shall also, concurrently with the filing of the demand, pay to the court clerk where the\naward was filed the amount of the fees payable to the panel by the\nadministrative office for the courts pursuant to section\n28.10\nof this Part. Where a\njudicial hearing officer has heard and determined the arbitration, the amount\npayable shall be the same as would have been payable to a single arbitrator or\na panel of three arbitrators, as the case may be, if such judicial hearing\nofficer had not been assigned. Such sum shall not be recoverable by the\ndemandant upon a trial de novoor in any other proceeding. (d) The arbitrators shall not\nbe called as witnesses nor shall the report or award of the arbitrators be\nadmitted in evidence at the trial de novo. (e) If the judgment upon the trial de\nnovo is not more favorable than the arbitration award in the amount of damages\nawarded or the type of relief granted to the demandant, the demandant shall not\nrecover interest or statutory costs and disbursements from the time of the\naward, but shall pay such statutory costs and disbursements to the other party\nor parties from the time of the filing of the demand for the trial de\nnovo. (f) If a\njudicial hearing officer has heard and determined an arbitration, the trial de\nnovo may not be presided over by a judicial hearing officer, except upon\nconsent of the parties. Notes\nN.Y.
