(b) 'Adverse modification of habitat' means\nany alteration of the occupied habitat of any species listed as endangered or\nthreatened in this Part that, as determined by the department, is likely to\nnegatively affect one or more essential behaviors of such species. (c) 'Commissioner' means the Commissioner of\nthe Department of Environmental Conservation. (d) 'Department' means the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation. (e) 'Endangered species' are species that: (1)\nare\nnative species in imminent danger of extirpation or extinction in New York\nbased on the criteria for listing in section 182.3(b) of this Part and that are\nlisted as endangered in section 182.5(a) of this Part; or\n(2)\nare species listed as endangered by the\n\nUnited States Department of the Interior in the Code of Federal Regulations (50\nCFR part\n17\n). (f) 'Essential behavior' means any of the behaviors exhibited by a species listed\nas endangered or threatened in this Part that are a part of its normal or\ntraditional life cycle and that are essential to its survival and perpetuation. Essential behavior includes behaviors associated with breeding, hibernation, reproduction, feeding, sheltering, migration and overwintering. (g) 'Experimental population' means a group\nof individuals of a threatened or endangered species listed in this Part that\nhas been designated by the department in accordance with section 182.17 of this\n\nPart for introduction into an experimental population area to aid in the\nrecovery of the species within New York. (h) 'Experimental population area' means a\ndiscrete geographical area composed of sufficient, suitable habitat capable of\nsustaining a population of a specific listed species that is established in\naccordance with section 182.17 of this Part for the purposes of establishing an\nexperimental population. (i) 'Extinct' means species no longer living or existing. (j) 'Extirpated' or 'Extirpation' means not\nextinct, but no longer occurring in a wild state within New York, or no longer\nexhibiting patterns of use traditional for that species in New York (e.g., historical breeders no longer breeding here). (k) 'Incidental take' means any taking of a\nspecies listed as endangered or threatened in section 182.5 of this Part and\notherwise prohibited by section 11-0535 of the Environmental Conservation Law\nthat is incidental to, and not the intended purpose of, an otherwise lawful\nactivity.

(n) 'Native' means any species that spends\nsome portion of its life cycle within New York State, has occurred here on a\nregular basis for many years, and was not intentionally or accidentally\nreleased into New York.

(o) 'Net conservation benefit' means a\nsuccessful enhancement of the species' subject population, successful\nenhancement of the species' overall population or a contribution to the\nrecovery of the species within New York. To be classified as a net conservation\nbenefit, the enhancement or contribution must benefit the affected species\nlisted as endangered or threatened in this Part or its habitat to a greater\ndegree than if the applicant's proposed activity were not undertaken. (p) 'Occupied habitat' means a geographic\narea in New York within which a species listed as endangered or threatened in\nthis Part has been determined by the department to exhibit one or more\nessential behaviors.

(u) 'Species' means\nany subspecies, distinct group or any distinct population segment of any such\ngroup of fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature. The term species\nrefers not only to independent or adult individuals, but also to any life form, stage, or part of the species, including but not limited to eggs, larvae, or\npupae. The term species does not include fish or wildlife produced as a result\nof artificial hybridization. (v) 'Species of special concern' are native species of fish and wildlife found by\nthe department to be at risk of becoming threatened in New York based on the\ncriteria for listing in section 182.4(a) of this Part and that are listed\nspecies of special concern in section 182.5(c) of this Part. Species of special\nconcern do not qualify as either endangered or threatened, as defined in\nsubdivisions (e) and (z) of this section, but have been determined by the\ndepartment to require some measure of protection to ensure that the species\ndoes not become threatened.
