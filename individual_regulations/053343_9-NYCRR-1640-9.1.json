  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-9.1 - Per annum employment\n\nState Regulations\n\nSubdivision 1 of section\n32\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law states a local housing authority may employ a general\nmanager, a secretary, technical experts and such other officers, agents and\nemployees as it may require and that employment shall be subject to the\nprovisions of the Civil Service Law applicable to the municipality in which it\nis established. The compensation of such employees is, further, subject to the\napproval of the local legislative body. The authority's table of organization\nand the rates of compensation it pays are further subject to the limitations\nimposed by the development cost and operating budgets which must have division\napproval. Division approval of the employment of specific individuals is\nrequired. The positions to be filled must have been provided for in an approved\nbudget in order for the compensation to be charged to State-aided projects and\nno compensation in excess of those provided for the respective positions in the\napproved budgets shall be charged to development costs or operating expenses of\n\nState-aided projects. In its periodic examinations, the division will therefore\nlook for the certification of the local civil service commission with respect\nto appointments, the approval of the local legislative body with respect to\ncompensation, and conformity with the approved development cost and operating\nbudgets. Division policy is that employees must take vacations. They may not be\npaid for accrued vacation time in lieu of taking vacation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-9.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
