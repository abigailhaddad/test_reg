  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 474.7 - Special permit and sticker\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 502(1)(b)\n(a) In the place of the highway use permit\nand plate or sticker (see sections\n470.1\nand\n473.1\nof\nthis Title), the emergency permit (see section\n473.2\nof this Title), and the trip-lease permit (see section\n473.3\nof this Title), carriers who are engaged in the business of transporting motor\nvehicles by saddle or full mount mechanism, or a combination of both, may\nsecure special permits and stickers by application to the Miscellaneous Tax\n\nBureau. (See section\n470.1\n[a]\nof this Title.) Form TMT-1.4, Application to Secure Special Highway Use\n\nTax Permits and Stickers, must be completed by the carrier and\nforwarded to the Miscellaneous Tax Bureau with a fee of $200 payable to the\n\nState Tax Commission. (b) Upon\napproval of the aforementioned application, the Miscellaneous Tax Bureau will\nforward to the carrier form TMT-1.5, Application for Special Highway\n\nUse Permits and Stickers, and form TMT-2.1, Special Highway\n\nUse Permit. The application should list the unloaded weight and\nmaximum gross weight for each motor vehicle for which a special permit and\nsticker is needed. A sufficient number should be shown to take care of all\nsimultaneous movements of motive powered vehicles carrying or hauling another\nvehicle or vehicles under saddle or full mount mechanism, or a combination of\nboth. A fee of $5 for each special permit and sticker should accompany the\napplication. The fee should be paid by check or money order payable to the\n\nState Tax Commission. There must also be submitted with the application, the\npermit form (TMT-2.1) for each special sticker listed in the application. The\npermit form consists of two parts, each of which must be completed. All the\nrequired information must be set forth in the application blank. (c) The application, fee and permit forms\nshould be mailed or delivered to the Miscellaneous Tax Bureau. (See section\n470.1\n[a]\nof this Title.)\n(d) The State Tax\n\nCommission will approve or reject all applications. If approved, the special\npermits and stickers will be mailed to the applicant at the address shown on\nthe application blank, unless the applicant furnishes a different mailing\naddress. (e) Special permits and\nstickers are to be used only by the carrier to whom issued and are transferable\namong those of the vehicles furnishing the motive power in the transportation\nof another vehicle or vehicles under saddle or full mount mechanism, or a\ncombination of both. They may not be used by any other carrier or\nentity. (f) Under this section\nmaximum gross weight is the maximum combined unloaded weights of all vehicles\ninvolved in a saddle or full mount operation, or a combination of both, exclusive of the weight of the driver and his helper. (g) Any such special permits and stickers\nshall be valid until revoked, suspended, cancelled, surrendered, or superseded\nby a replacement series of permits and stickers. (See section\n474.9\nof this Part.) All of the other provisions of this Subchapter with respect to\npermits and stickers shall be applicable to special permits and stickers issued\nhereunder, with the exception that special permits and stickers should remain\nwith the driver so that they are available for inspection by enforcement\nauthorities. (h) Nothing contained\nin this section shall in any way exempt such carrier from the payment of the\ntax levied pursuant to article 21 of the Tax Law. (i) Examples. Example 1: Carrier A operates tractor-trailer combinations used to\ntransport new cars. Special permits and stickers do not apply to this operation\nsince the trailer, on which the new cars are carried, is not part of a saddle\nor full mount mechanism, or combination of both. Example 2: Carrier B delivers new trucks \"piggy back.\" The unloaded\nweight of each trunk involved is 10,000 pounds. This is a saddle mount\noperation to which special permits and stickers would apply. The declared\nmaximum gross weights for this carrier's special permits and stickers should be\n20,000 pounds and the unloaded weight should be 10,000 pounds. Highway use tax\nshould be reported on the tax return at $.006 per mile if reported on maximum\ngross weight basis or $.005 if reported on unloaded weight basis. (See section\n481.1\nof\nthis Title.)\n\nExample 3: Carrier C has an operation whereby three vehicles are\ndelivered under simultaneous movements. The motive powered vehicle in this\noperation has fully mounted on it a second vehicle. The third vehicle's front\nwheels rest on the rear chassis of the first vehicle and its rear wheels are on\nthe highway. This is a combination saddle and full mount mechanism, to which a\nspecial permit and sticker applies. Example 4: Carrier D transports two vehicles \"piggy back.\" The\nmotive-powered vehicle and the vehicle carried thereon each weigh 8,500 pounds. A special highway use permit and sticker must be used for the motive-powered\nvehicle if the carrier elects to compute the tax on the unloaded weight method. (See section\n481.9\nof\nthis Title.) Its unloaded weight is 8,500 pounds and its maximum gross weight\nis 17,000 pounds. If carrier D reports on the maximum gross weight basis, no\npermit is required for this vehicle and the mileage for this movement is not\ntaxable since the maximum gross weight of the vehicle involved is not over\n18,000 pounds. Under the unloaded weight method, the mileage over New York\n\nState public highways is taxable at the rate of $.004 per\nmile. (j) It should be noted\nthat the provisions of this section are not mandatory and any carrier engaged\nin the business of transporting motor vehicles by saddle or full mount\nmechanism, or a combination of both, may secure emergency permits or trip-lease\npermits in lieu of the special permits and stickers described above. (See\nsections\n473.2\nand\n473.3\nof this Title.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n474.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
