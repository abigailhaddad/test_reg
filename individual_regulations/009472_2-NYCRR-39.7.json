  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 39.7 - Private sale of certificates of participation\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe governing board or the chief fiscal officer, if the\ngoverning board has delegated such power to him, may determine that a public\nsale of certificates of participation is not in the best interests of the\npolitical subdivision. The determination of the governing board or chief fiscal\nofficer, as the case may be, shall state that a private sale of such\ncertificates of participation is expected to reduce the cost of financing and\nset forth the specific factors upon which the governing board or chief fiscal\nofficer has relied on making such determination. The factors recited in such\ndetermination may include: (a) unstable or volatile market conditions; (b) conditions of fiscal stress or negative\ncredit factors being experienced by the issuer; (c) the large dollar amount of the proposed\nissue; (d) the complexity of the\nissue; or\n(e) any other factor\nwhich the governing board or chief fiscal officer, as the case may be, reasonably and in good faith believes will cause the cost of financing to be\nlower if the certificates of participation are sold at private rather than\npublic sale. Such determination, if made by the governing board, shall\nbe made by resolution and if made by the chief fiscal officer, shall be made in\na certificate filed with the governing board prior to such sale. Upon making\nthe determination required by this paragraph, such certificates of\nparticipation may be sold at private sale provided that any underwriters, providers of letters of credit or liquidity facilities, bond counsel and\nfinancial advisors to be used in connection with such sale have been selected\nin accordance with the policies and procedures contained in section\n37.5\n(b)-(e)\nof\nthis Title. The prior approval of the State Comptroller shall not be required\nfor any private sale of certificates of participation conducted in accordance\nwith the requirements of this paragraph. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n39.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
