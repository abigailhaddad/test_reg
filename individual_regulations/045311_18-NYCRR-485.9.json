  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 485.9 - Receivership\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Receiver\nappointed upon application of the commissioner. (1)\n\nWhen the department revokes or\ntemporarily suspends the operating certificate of an adult care facility\nsubject to this Part, excluding shelters for adults that are addressed in Part\n491 of this Title, and the commissioner determines that appointment of a\nreceiver is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the\nresidents of a facility, the commissioner may seek the appointment of a\nreceiver by applying to the Supreme Court in the county where the facility is\nsituated for an order directing the operators, owners and prime lessors, if\nany, of the premises to show cause why the commissioner, or at the discretion\nof the commissioner his designee, should not be appointed receiver to take\ncharge of the facility. (2)\n\nThe\ncommissioner shall not be required to seek the appointment of a receiver or to\nassume the responsibilities of a receiver directly or indirectly through his\ndesignee; nor shall any court be authorized to compel the commissioner to\nassume the responsibilities of a receiver or to appoint a designee to assume\nsuch responsibilities. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment may, if it deems appropriate, grant an operating certificate to any\nfacility operating or scheduled to operate under a receiver. The duration of\nthe operating certificate shall not exceed the duration of the\nreceivership. (4)\n\nAny receiver\nappointed upon application of the commissioner shall have all of the powers and\nduties of a receiver appointed in an action to foreclose a mortgage on real\nproperty, together with the following additional powers and duties: (i) The receiver shall, with all reasonable\nspeed but, in any case, within six months after the date on which the\nreceivership was ordered, unless otherwise extended by the court, provide for\nthe orderly transfer of all residents in the facility to other facilities or\nmake other provisions for their continued safety and care. (ii)\n\nThe receiver shall operate the facility\nin compliance with regulations of the department. (iii)\n\nThe receiver, with the approval of the\ncommissioner, shall incur expenses as may be necessary to operate the facility. He shall collect incoming payments from all sources and apply them to the costs\nincurred in the performance of his functions as receiver. The receiver shall\nhonor all existing leases, mortgages and chattel mortgages that have previously\nbeen undertaken as obligations of the owners or operators of the facility. No\nsecurity interest in any real or personal property comprising the facility or\ncontained within the facility, or in any fixture of the facility, shall be\nimpaired or diminished by the receiver. The receiver shall compensate the\nowners of any goods held in inventory for those goods which he uses or causes\nto be used by reimbursing the costs of such goods, except that no such\ncompensation shall be made for any such goods for which owners have already\nbeen reimbursed. (iv)\n\nThe receiver\nshall not be required to file any bond. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision and, except in the case where the receiver is assuming an existing\nbona fide arm's-length lease, the commissioner shall determine a reasonable\nmonthly rental for the facility, based on consideration of all appropriate\nfactors, including the condition of such facility. The rent, as determined by\nthe commissioner, shall be paid by the receiver to the owners or prime lessors\nas may be directed by the court for each month that the receivership remains in\neffect. In the event that the amount established by the commissioner is less\nthan the currently valid lease, the obligation of the operator shall not be\naltered or diminished. (6)\n\nThe\nreceiver: (i) shall be entitled to a fee and\nreimbursement for expenses as determined by the commissioner, based upon\nconsideration of all appropriate factors relating to the operation of the\nfacility, to be paid as a charge against the operator, not to exceed the fees, commissions and necessary expenses authorized to be paid to receivers in an\naction to foreclose a mortgage; (ii)\nshall be liable only in his official\ncapacity for injury to person and property by reason of conditions of the\nfacility in a case where an owner or operator would have been liable; he shall\nnot have any liability in his personal capacity, except for gross negligence\nand intentional acts; (iii)\nmay, subject to approval by the commissioner, ratify any collective bargaining\nagreement in effect between the operator and the employees of a facility, or\nsuspend such collective bargaining agreement; provided, however, that the\nreceiver, in his official capacity, remains liable for payment of wages and\nsalaries at the rates and levels in effect at the time of his appointment; and\n(iv)\nshall notify the\ncommissioner of any lien or conveyance made in contemplation of receivership\nwith an intent to remove an asset of the facility from the jurisdiction and use\nof the receiver, or to hinder or delay the receiver in the execution of his\nduties and responsibilities as receiver. (7)\n(i) Any\nperson who is served a copy of an order of the court appointing the receiver\nshall, upon being notified of the name and address of the receiver, make all\npayments for goods supplied by the facility, or services rendered by the\nfacility, to the receiver. A receipt shall be given for each such payment, and\ncopies of all such receipts shall be kept on file by the receiver. The amount\nso received shall be deposited by the receiver in a special account which shall\nalso be used for all disbursements made by the receiver. (ii)\n\nAny person who refuses or omits to make\nsuch payment after such service and notice may be sued therefor by the\nreceiver. Such person shall not in such suit dispute the authority of the\nreceiver to incur or order such expenses, or the right of the receiver for any\nsuch payments made to him. The receipt of the receiver for any sum paid to him\nshall, in all suits and proceedings and for every purpose, be as effectual in\nfavor of any person holding the same as actual payment who would have been\nentitled to receive the sum so paid. No resident shall be discharged, nor shall\nany contract of rights be forfeited or impaired, nor any forfeiture or\nliability be incurred, by reason of any omission to pay any owner, contractor\nor other person any sum so paid to the receiver. (8)\n\nAll transactions involving the\nreceivership shall be on the accrual basis of accounting. (9)\n\nObligations of the operators, owners or\nprime lessors. (i) The operators, owners or\nprime lessors shall not be relieved of any civil or criminal liability or\nobligation incurred, or any duty imposed by law, by reason of acts or omissions\nof such persons prior to the appointment of any receiver. During the period a\nfacility is operated by a receiver, the operator, owner or prime lessor, if\nany, shall continue to be liable for all obligations for the payment of taxes\nor other operating and maintenance expenses of the facility, and the owner or\nother appropriate person shall continue to be liable for the payment of\nmortgages or liens. (ii)\n\nExpenses\nincurred by a receiver to meet the operating and maintenance expenses of the\nfacility and the basic needs of the residents of the facility shall be deemed\nthe obligations of the operator, and not the obligations of the receiver or the\n\nState. (iii)\n\nThe receiver shall not\nbe responsible for any obligations incurred by the owner, operator or prime\nlessor, if any, prior to the appointment of the receiver. (iv)\n\nThe receiver shall be entitled to use\nfor operating and maintenance expenses, and for the basic needs of the\nresidents of the facility, a portion of the revenues due the operator during\nthe month in which the receiver is appointed. This portion shall be established\non the basis of the amounts of the operating and maintenance expenses for such\nmonth. Such amounts shall be prorated by dividing the number of days of the\nreceivership appointment by the number of days in the month. (v) Any sums determined to be due and owing\nby the receiver to the owner, operator or prime lessor shall be offset by any\ncharges determined to be the obligations of the owner, operator or prime\nlessor. (10)\n\nThe court\nshall terminate the receivership only under any of the following circumstances: (i) six months after the date on which it was\nordered, except that the court may extend such period for good cause\nshown; (ii)\nwhen the department\ngrants an operator a new operating certificate; or\n(iii)\nat such time as all of the residents in\nthe facility have been provided alternative modes of care, either in another\nfacility or otherwise. (11)\n\nAt the time of termination of the\nreceivership, the receiver shall render a full and complete accounting to the\ncourt and shall dispose of any profit or surplus as instructed by the\ncourt. (12)\n\nPayments to receivers\nappointed upon application of the commissioner. (i) The commissioner is authorized to make\npayments to a receiver only if the receiver demonstrates to the satisfaction of\nthe commissioner that the facility's funds which are available are insufficient\nto meet operating and maintenance expenses of the facility and the basic needs\nof the residents of the facility. (ii)\n\nThe operator shall be liable for all\nmonies made available to the receiver pursuant to this paragraph. (iii)\n\nAny payments made by the commissioner\nto a receiver shall be made without any obligation on the part of the social\nservices district, in which the receiver-operated facility is located, to\nreimburse the department for any such payments. (b) Court-appointed receiver without\napplication of the commissioner. (1)\n\nIn the event of a transfer of possession of the premises of a facility from an\napproved operator to a court-appointed receiver, the department may authorize\nsuch court-appointed receiver to continue to operate the facility for a\ntemporary period pending the filing and review of an application to the\ndepartment by the receiver or by another person for an operating\ncertificate. (2)\n\nSuch temporary\nauthorization shall be granted and continued only if the court-appointed\nreceiver agrees to and complies with the terms and conditions set by the\ndepartment. Such terms and conditions shall include: (i) operation of the facility in compliance\nwith the regulations of the department; (ii)\na waiver by the receiver of any\nassessment of fees against the department, the commissioner, and the\n\nState; (iii)\nsubmission of a\nstatement of intention to apply or not to apply for certification as operator\nof the facility within 15 days after transfer of possession to the\nreceiver; (iv)\nif the receiver\nindicates an intention to apply for an operating certificate, submission of an\napplication for an operating certificate within 90 days after the transfer of\npossession to the receiver, unless the time for such filing is extended by the\ndepartment; (v) if the receiver\nindicates no intention to apply for an operating certificate, agreement to\ncooperate fully with potential operators and the department in the orderly\ntransfer of the facility to a certified operator or to provide for the orderly\ntransfer of all residents in the facility to other facilities or make other\nprovisions for their continued safety and care. (3)\n\nThe commissioner may make application to\nappear and advise the court of any objections he may have to the transfer of\npossession from the approved operator to any other persons, including a\nreceiver, or of any objections he may have to continuing a receiver or any\nother person in possession.
