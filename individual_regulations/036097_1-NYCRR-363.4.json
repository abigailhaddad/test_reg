  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 363.4 - Proration of reimbursement claims if in excess of appropriation\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf the total eligible amounts claimed for reimbursement, as\napproved by the committee and the department, exceed the appropriation\ntherefor, each district would be reimbursed a pro rata amount equivalent to the\npercentage arrived at by dividing the appropriation by the total eligible\nreimbursement. For example, if there is a total of $120,000 eligible\nreimbursement expenditures from districts, and the appropriation is $80,000, each district would receive two thirds of the amount it would be otherwise\neligible for. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n363.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
