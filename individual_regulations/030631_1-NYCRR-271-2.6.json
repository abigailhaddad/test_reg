  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 §§ 271-2.6 - Refrigerated/frozen storage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Refrigeration units or effectively insulated units shall be provided in such\nnumber and of such capacity to assure the maintenance of potentially hazardous\nfood at required temperatures during storage. Each mechanically refrigerated\nunit storing potentially hazardous food shall be provided with a numerically\nscaled indicating thermometer, accurate to plus or minus 3°F (congruent to plus\nor minus 1°C). The sensing element shall be located to measure the air\ntemperature in the unit at a location that is representative of the air\ntemperature in the unit. The thermometer scale shall be located to be easily\nreadable. Recording thermometers, accurate to plus or minus 3°F (congruent to\nplus or minus 1°C) may be used in lieu of indicating thermometers. In lieu of a\nthermometer, portable refrigeration units which rely on contact with\nrefrigerated surfaces rather than airflow shall have product temperature\nmonitored at sufficient frequency to ensure proper temperature. (b) Potentially hazardous frozen foods shall\nbe kept frozen and shall be stored at an air temperature of 0°F (congruent to\nminus 18°C) or below except for defrost cycles and brief periods of loading or\nunloading. (c) Ice used as a\ncooling medium for food storage shall not be used or sold for human\nconsumption. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
