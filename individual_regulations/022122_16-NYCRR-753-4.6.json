Tit. 16 §§ 753-4.6 - Locating underground facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever an operator's underground\nfacilities are in or within 15 feet of a work area, such facility shall be\nlocated, accurately and with due care, by means of staking, marking or other\ndesignation in accordance with the provisions of this Subpart. (b) The following staking and marking\nrequirements shall apply: (1)\nstakes or\nsurface markings shall be provided preferably at the center line of the\nunderground facility and at such sufficient intervals as is necessary to\nindicate clearly the location and direction of run of such underground\nfacility; (2)\nall stakes and\nsurface markings shall be color coded in accordance with the provisions of this\n\nSubpart in order to identify the type of underground facility so staked or\nmarked; (3)\nstakes and surface\nmarkings shall indicate in inches the size or diameter of the underground\nfacility or its encasement, if known; (4)\neach stake and surface marking shall\nindicate in inches the depth of the underground facility at that point, if\nknown; (5)\nsurface markings shall\nconsist of paint, dye or equivalent material which is color coded in accordance\nwith the provisions of this Subpart and which contrasts with the ground or\nequivalent surface; and\n(6)\nwhere\nconditions exist so as to render center line staking or marking impractical or\nconfusing, the operator may indicate the location of an underground facility by\nmeans of offset staking or remote tie-in markings which will clearly indicate\nthe location and direction of run of the facility. (c) If staking or marking are not used to\nindicate the location of an underground facility, the operator shall designate\nsuch location in accordance with the following: (1)\nby exposing the underground facility or\nits encasement to view within the work area in a manner sufficient to allow the\nexcavator to verify the type, size, direction of run and depth of the\nfacility; (2)\nby providing field\nrepresentation and instruction to the excavator in the work area; or\n(3)\nby any other means as mutually agreed to\nby the operator and excavator, including but not limited to written\ndescriptions, photographs or verbal instructions. Such agreement shall be\nprovided in writing to the excavator upon his or her request. (d) An operator, or its agents or\ncontractors, performing excavation or demolition work at or near his or her own\nunderground facility shall not be required to stake, mark or otherwise\ndesignate such underground facility.
