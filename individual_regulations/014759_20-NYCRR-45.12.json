  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 45.12 - Profits from the sale of personal property\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The law requires that there shall be\nincluded in gross income \"profit from the sale of personal property (other than\nproperty of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the\ntaxpayer if on hand at the close of the period for which a return is\nmade)\". (b) Excluded from\nconsideration under this heading are \"sales made and services rendered\", including sales of merchandise forming a part of the utility's stock in trade\nand also \"sales of securities\", both of which have been hereinbefore\nconsidered. The quoted clause relates to the sale of other kinds of personal\nproperty, as for example, sales of furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, and other items of fixed assets not ordinarily held as a part of stock in\ntrade--a kind of personal property which would not properly be included in\nmerchandise inventory if on hand at the close of the reporting period. Profit\nfrom the sale of the kind of personal property here under consideration is\nrequired to be included in gross income. Question 48:A telephone company, not engaged in\nmerchandising wire, sells 5,000 pounds of copper wire to an electric light\ncompany realizing a profit on the transaction. Is such profit required to be\nincluded in the gross income of the telephone company? Answer: Yes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n45.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
