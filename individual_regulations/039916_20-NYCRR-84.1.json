  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 84.1 - Rebates and concessions\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 484(a)\n(a) (1)\n\nAs\nindicated in Part 82 of this Title, it is unlawful and a violation of article\n20-A of the Tax Law for any agent, CMSA wholesale dealer, chain store or CMSA\nretail dealer, with the intent to harm competitors or competition or to avoid\ntaxation, to advertise, offer to sell or sell cigarettes at less than cost. Any\nevidence of an offer of a rebate in price, or giving of a rebate in price, an\noffer of a concession, or giving of a concession of any kind or nature\nwhatsoever in connection with the sale of cigarettes in New York State is prima\nfacie evidence of such intent. (2)\n\nMoreover, it is unlawful and a violation of such article for any CMSA wholesale\ndealer, chain store or CMSA retail dealer to induce, attempt to induce, procure\nor attempt to procure the purchase of cigarettes at a price which is less than\ncost or to so induce or procure, or attempt to induce or procure, any rebate or\nconcession of any kind or nature whatsoever in connection with the purchase of\ncigarettes in this State. Inducing or attempting to induce, or procuring or\nattempting to procure the purchase of cigarettes at a price which is less than\ncost is prima facie evidence of an intent to harm competitors or competition or\nto avoid taxation. A rebate or a concession will be deemed induced or procured\nwhen such rebate or concession is knowingly brought about or caused by any\neffort, influence or persuasion by or on behalf of the purchaser. (b) (1)\n\nThe words rebate and concession shall not\nbe strictly construed so as to narrow or circumvent the cigarette marketing\nstandards. In general, rebate and concession are synonymous in that each\nconveys the offer or giving, in the case of the seller, or the inducement or\nprocurement, in the case of the purchaser, of anything of value. Generally, a\nconcession is the granting or yielding to a request or demand at or before the\ntime of sale, where as a rebate is a return of something of value at a later\ntime. (2)\nA rebate or a concession, in and of itself, is neither unlawful for the purpose of the cigarette\nmarketing standards nor a violation of the Tax Law where such rebate or\nconcession does not directly or indirectly serve to reduce the price below that\nat which cigarettes can be lawfully sold or purchased in this State. A\ndetermination as to whether a rebate or concession has been offered, given, induced or procured and as to whether or not such rebate or concession reduces\nthe price of cigarettes below the legal minimum, demands a close analysis of\neach situation on its own merits. The burden of proving the legality of a\nrebate or concession shall be upon the seller when such rebate or concession is\noffered or given, and upon the purchaser when the rebate or concession is\ninduced or procured. (c) A rebate and a concession for purposes of this Part shall be distinguished from\na trade discount, which is taken into consideration in determining the basic\ncost of cigarettes. A trade discount is accorded an agent by a manufacturer of\ncigarettes at the time of sale (see section\n80.2\n[a]\nof this Title). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n84.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
