  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 851.3 - Regional requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt shall be the policy of the commission to promote and\nencourage planning for regional solutions to water pollution problems including\nproblems derived from both point and nonpoint sources of pollution. The\ncommission may recognize that the most efficient and environmentally acceptable\nregional solution may be small multiple facilities spread throughout a\nwatershed. The use of regional water pollution control facilities and/or\ninstitutional arrangements providing optimum combinations of efficiency, reliability and service area will be required throughout the Delaware River\n\nBasin to the maximum extent feasible. The commission will cooperate with\nindustries and State, county and municipal agencies seeking a regional solution\nto water pollution problems. The commission may provide planning, and when\nnecessary, constructing, financing and operating services required for regional\nsolutions to water pollution problems where other appropriate agencies do not\nprovide such services. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n851.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
