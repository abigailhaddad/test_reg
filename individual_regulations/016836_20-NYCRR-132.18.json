  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 132.18 - Earnings of nonresident employees and officers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a nonresident employee (including\ncorporate officers, but excluding employees provided for in section\n132.17\nof\nthis Part) performs services for his employer both within and without New York\n\nState, his income derived from New York State sources includes that proportion\nof his total compensation for services rendered as an employee which the total\nnumber of working days employed within New York State bears to the total number\nof working days employed both within and without New York State. The items of\ngain, loss and deduction (other than deductions entering into the New York\nitemized deduction) of the employee attributable to his employment, derived\nfrom or connected with New York State sources, are similarly determined. However, any allowance claimed for days worked outside New York State must be\nbased upon the performance of services which of necessity, as distinguished\nfrom convenience, obligate the employee to out-of-state duties in the service\nof his employer. In making the allocation provided for in this section, no\naccount is taken of nonworking days, including Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, days of absence because of illness or personal injury, vacation, or leave with\nor without pay. Example 1:A, a resident of Connecticut, is an officer\nand substantial stockholder of the X Corporation, having its principal office\nin New York City. During the taxable year, A performs the following services\nfor X Corporation: Services performed for X Corporation wholly\nwithin New York State. 210 days\n\nSales conventions in Hot Springs, Ark. and Miami, Fla. (A passed through New York State to board\nairplanes on four of these days.) 10 days\n\nCalling on customers in Pacific Coast states. 20\ndays\nA's salary from the X Corporation is $40,000 per\nyear. A's New York adjusted gross income is determined as\nfollows: Total number of working days within New York State\n(210) divided by total number of working days both within and without New York\n\nState (240) is 210/240 or 87.5 percent, which, when applied against A's salary\nof $40,000, equals $35,000, A's New York adjusted gross income. Days on which A\nentered New York State solely for the purpose of boarding or disembarking from\nan airplane or train do not count as days worked in New York State. Example 2:B, a resident of New Jersey, is an employee\nof the X Corporation, having its principal office in New York City. During the\ntaxable year, B was sent to Chicago by X Corporation to help establish a new\nsales office. All other services which he performed for X Corporation were\nperformed wholly within New York State. B passed through New York State to\nboard a plane on Sunday, March 31st, and to disembark on Friday, April 26th. While in Chicago, B held meetings in his hotel room on Saturday, April 6th, and\n\nSaturday, April 20th. B allocates 217 working days to New York State as\nfollows: Total days in year 365\n\nNonworking days: Saturdays and Sundays (there are 104 Saturdays and\n\nSundays; however, since the Sunday spent traveling and the two Saturdays spent\nholding meetings in his hotel room in Chicago are to be included in total\nworking days, these days are not included in nonworking days). 101\n\nHolidays 11\n\nSick leave 3\n\nVacation 10\n\nTotal nonworking days 125\n\nTotal days worked during year (365 minus 125)\n240\n\nTotal days worked outside New York State. (A total of\n27 days was spent in Chicago; however, four of these days are Saturdays or\n\nSundays on which no services were rendered for his employer and are included in\nnonworking days, not in days worked outside New York State. Therefore, in\ndetermining the total number of days worked outside New York State, B includes\nthe 20 normal working days spent in Chicago, plus the Sunday spent traveling, plus the two Satur-\ndays spent holding meetings in his hotel room.)\n23\n\nTotal days worked in New York State (240 minus 23)\n217\n(b) Where a nonresident\nemployee (including corporate officers, but excluding employees provided for in\nsection\n132.17\nof\nthis Part) performs services both within and without New York State for only\npart of a taxable year, his income derived from New York State sources during\nthat period includes only that portion of compensation received during the\nperiod he performs services both within and without New York State, multiplied\nby a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days he worked within New\n\nYork State and the denominator of which is the number of days he worked both\nwithin and without New York State during the period he was required to perform\nservices both within and without New York State. Example:E, a resident of New Jersey for the entire\ntaxable year, was employed by T Corporation for the entire taxable year. During\nthe period from January 1st through June 30th he worked at the company's\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa. office. Since E did not perform any services within New York\n\nState during this period, none of the compensation received for such period\nwould be includible in computing his New York adjusted gross income. On July\n1st, E was transferred to the company's New York City office where he was\nrequired to perform services both within and without New York State. The New\n\nYork adjusted gross income of E includes the total compensation received from T\nCorporation during the period from July 1st through December 31st, multiplied\nby a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days worked within New\n\nYork State during the period from July 1st through December 31st and the\ndenominator of which is the total number of days worked both within and without\n\nNew York State during this same period. (c) If a nonresident employee (including\ncorporate officers, but excluding employees provided for in section\n132.17\nof\nthis Part) performs services for more than one employer both within and without\n\nNew York State, he must determine separately for each such employer the\nallocable compensation attributable to New York State sources. In determining\nthe income from New York State sources, the total compensation from each such\nemployer must be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number\nof days the nonresident employee performed services within New York State for\nsuch employer and the denominator of which is the total number of days during\nwhich the employee performed services both within and without New York State\nfor such employer. The sum of the amounts of compensation determined as\nallocable to New York State sources must be included in computing the New York\nadjusted gross income of the nonresident employee. Example:B, a resident of New Jersey, performed services\nfor Y Corporation during the period January 1st through June 28th, for which he\nreceived total compensation of $20,000. He performed services for Y Corporation\na total of 120 working days during this period, of which 90 days were\nattributable to services performed wholly within New York State and 30 days\nwere attributable to services performed wholly outside New York State. B\nterminated his employment with Y Corporation at the close of business on June\n28th and went to work for Z Corporation on July 1st. For the period July 1st\nthrough December 31st he received total compensation of $25,000. He performed\nservices for Z Corporation for 120 working days during this period, of which 60\ndays were attributable to services performed wholly within New York State and\n60 days were attributable to services performed wholly outside New York State. B's New York adjusted gross income includes compensation for personal services\nin the amount of $27,500, computed as follows: Y Corporation 90/120 x $20,000 = $15,000\nZ Corporation 60/120 x $25,000 = 12,500\n\nTotal $27,500\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
