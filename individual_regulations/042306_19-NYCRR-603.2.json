Any water area and underwater lands\nlandward of this line will, however, be subject to harbor management planning\nand regulation pursuant to this Part; (iii)\nwhere an offshore island is part of a\nmunicipality, the 1,500 feet shall be measured from the mean low water line\nsurrounding the island; (iv)\nin all\ninstances, the area between the mean low water and mean high water lines shall\nalso be subject to HMP coverage; and\n(v) whenever necessary the Secretary shall\nmake a determination of the bounds of an HMP area, based upon written findings\nwhich take into account the size of the waterbody; existing municipal\nregulation of waters and underwater lands; the avoidance of conflicts among\nlocal, State and Federal governments; and other relevant\nconsiderations. (b) Subject to the written approval of the\n\nSecretary of State, the local legislative body of such city or town may adopt, amend and enforce local laws or ordinances, and a village may adopt, amend and\nenforce local laws to implement the HMP.
