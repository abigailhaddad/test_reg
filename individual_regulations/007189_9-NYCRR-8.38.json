  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8.38 - Executive order no. 38: limits on state-funded administrative costs and executive compensation\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, State Government in New York directly or\nindirectly funds, or authorizes reimbursements with other taxpayer dollars to, a large number of tax exempt organizations and for-profit entities that provide\ncritical services to New Yorkers in need; and\nWHEREAS, State Government in New York has an ongoing\nobligation to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are used properly, efficiently and\neffectively to improve the lives of New Yorkers and our communities; and\nWHEREAS, in certain instances providers of services that\nreceive State funds or State-authorized payments have used such funds to pay\nfor excessive administrative costs and outsized compensation for their senior\nexecutives, rather than devoting a greater proportion of such funds to\nproviding direct care or services to their clients; and\nWHEREAS, such abuses involving public funds harm both the\npeople of New York who are paying for such services, and those persons who must\ndepend upon such services to be available and well-funded; and\nWHEREAS, to curb such abuses in executive compensation and\nadministrative costs and ensure that taxpayer dollars are used first and\nforemost to help New Yorkers in need; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Andrew M. Cuomo, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1. Within ninety days of this Executive\n\nOrder, the commissioner of each Executive State agency that provides State\nfinancial assistance or State-authorized payments to providers of services, including but not limited to the Office for People with Developmental\n\nDisabilities, Office of Mental Health, Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse\n\nServices, Office of Children and Family Services, Office of Temporary and\n\nDisability Assistance, Department of Health, Office for the Aging, Division of\n\nCriminal Justice Services, and Office of Victim Services shall promulgate\nregulations, and take any other actions within the agency's authority including\namending agreements with such providers to address the extent and nature of a\nprovider's administrative costs and executive compensation that shall be\neligible to be reimbursed with State financial assistance or State-authorized\npayments for operating expenses. 2. Each such agency's regulations shall include but not be limited to requirements\nthat providers of services that receive reimbursements directly or indirectly\nfrom such agency must comply with the following restrictions: a. No less than seventy-five percent of the\n\nState financial assistance or State-authorized payments to a provider for\noperating expenses shall be directed to provide direct care or services rather\nthan to support administrative costs, as these terms are defined by the\napplicable State agency in implementing these requirements. This percentage\nshall increase by five percent each year until it shall, no later than April 1, 2015, remain at no less than eighty-five percent thereafter. b. To the extent practicable, reimbursement\nwith State financial assistance or State-authorized payments shall not be\nprovided for compensation paid or given to any executive by such provider in an\namount greater than $199,000 per annum, provided, however, that the\ncommissioner of each agency shall have discretion to adjust this figure\nannually based on appropriate factors and subject to the approval of the\n\nDirector of the Budget, but in no event shall such figure exceed Level I of the\nfederal government's Rates of Basic Pay for the Executive Schedule promulgated\nby the United States Office of Personnel Management. 3. A provider's failure to comply with such\nregulations established by the applicable state agency shall, in the\ncommissioner's sole discretion, form the basis for termination or non-renewal\nof the agency's contract with or continued support of the provider. Each\nagency's regulations shall provide that, under appropriate circumstances and\nupon a showing of good cause, a provider may be granted a waiver from\ncompliance with these or other related requirements in whole or in part subject\nto the approval of the applicable State agency and the Director of the\n\nBudget. 4. The commissioner for\neach such agency shall regularly obtain the data from providers that is needed\nto monitor the providers' compliance with these requirements and shall report\nto the Director of the Budget on an annual basis the impact of these\nrequirements on the use of public funds to support excessive executive\ncompensation and administrative costs among providers.
