  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 534.9 - Refund of sales or compensating use tax to consumers who have recovered the purchase price or a portion of such price from the manufacturer of a motor vehicle pursuant to section 198-a or 396-p(5) of the General Business Law\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1139(f)\n(a) General. (1)\n\nSection\n1139 (f)\nof the Tax Law\nprovides that a consumer may obtain from the Tax Department a refund of the\nsales or compensating use tax paid on the purchase price, capitalized cost and\nfees and charges, or portion thereof, refunded to the consumer by a motor\nvehicle manufacturer pursuant to the provisions of section\n198-a\nor\n396-p (5)\nof\nthe General Business Law. (2)\n\nSection\n198-a\nof the General Business Law (the New\n\nCar Lemon Law) provides that under certain circumstances where a new motor\nvehicle does not conform to the manufacturer's warranties, the manufacturer, at\nthe option of the consumer, shall refund to the consumer the full purchase\nprice of the vehicle plus certain fees and charges. In the instance of a leased\nvehicle the consumer must receive the capitalized cost of the vehicle plus\ncertain fees and charges. Section\n198-a (a)(8)\nof the\n\nGeneral Business Law defines the term\ncapitalized cost\nas the\naggregate deposit and rental payments previously paid to the lessor for the\nleased vehicle less service fees. Service fees\nmeans the\nportion of a lease payment attributable to: (i) an amount for earned interest calculated\non the rental payments previously paid to the lessor for the leased vehicle at\nan annual rate equal to two points above the prime rate in effect on the date\nof the execution of the lease; and\n(ii)\nany insurance or other costs expended by\nthe lessor for the benefit of the lessee. The amount refunded to the consumer, whether the vehicle is\npurchased or leased, may be reduced to reflect the extent of use of the vehicle\nby the consumer. (3)\n\nSection\n396-p (5)\nof the General\n\nBusiness Law requires, with certain limitations, that disclosure be made to the\nconsumer of any repairs made to a new motor vehicle after shipment from the\nmanufacturer to the dealer, including damage to the vehicle while in transit. If such disclosure is not made, the consumer may be eligible for a full or\npartial refund of the purchase price, including any trade-in allowance plus\ncertain fees and charges. The amount refunded to the consumer may be adjusted\nto reflect the extent of use of the vehicle by the consumer as well as\nmodifications made to the vehicle by the consumer. (b) Refund under section\n1139 (f)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (1)\n\nThe tax to be refunded will\nnot exceed the actual tax which was computed and paid on receipts subject to\ntax as evidenced on the invoice given the consumer. Should only a portion of\nthe purchase price or capitalized cost and fees and charges be refunded to the\nconsumer, then the tax must be prorated accordingly. (2)\n\nThe tax refund claim must be submitted in\na processible form, as described in section\n534.2\n(a)(2)\nof this Part. (3)\n(i) The tax refund claim must be filed within\nthree years of the date the consumer received the refund of the purchase price\nor capitalized cost and fees and charges, or portion thereof, from the\nmanufacturer. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of\nthis subdivision, the consumer will be presumed to have received the refund of\nthe purchase price or capitalized cost and fees and charges, or portion\nthereof, from the manufacturer on the date of issuance appearing on the\nmanufacturer's refund check to the claimant. Alternatively, the claimant may\nestablish the date that such refund was received by furnishing any other\nevidence satisfactory to the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. (4)\n\nInterest payable on the\nrefunded tax will be computed from the date that is three months after the date\nthe application form is received by the Tax Department in processible\nform. (c) Refund\nwith respect to used motor vehicles. Section\n198-b\nof the General Business Law (the\n\nUsed Car Lemon Law) requires that if, after a reasonable period of time, the\ndealer or its agent fails to correct a malfunction or defect as required by the\nwarranty which substantially impairs the value of the used motor vehicle to the\nconsumer, the dealer shall accept the return of the used motor vehicle from the\nconsumer and refund to the consumer the full purchase price, or in the case of\na lease contract all payments made under the contract, including sales and\ncompensating use tax, less a reasonable allowance for any damage not\nattributable to normal wear or usage, and adjustment for any modifications\nwhich either increase or decrease the market value of the vehicle or of the\nlease contract, and in the case of a lease contract, shall cancel all further\npayments due from the consumer under the lease contract. The vendor is also\nentitled to a refund or credit of any sales or compensating use tax refunded to\nthe consumer for the return of the defective motor vehicle in accordance with\nand provided the vendor meets the conditions stated in section\n534.6\n(a)(2)\nof this Part.
