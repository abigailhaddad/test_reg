No additional fee is required for an exemption application. (i) Exemption from General Business Law, section 359-e. A cooperative corporation whose shares are to be sold pursuant to an\noffering plan filed with the Department of Law is deemed exempted from the registration requirements of General Business Law, section 359-e, provided\nthat all offering activities are engaged in exclusively by persons duly registered under the filing requirements of General Business Law, section\n359-e. No application for exemption need be filed by a cooperative corporation exempted under this subdivision. (j) Effectiveness of regulations.

(l) Disclaimers. The requirements set forth in section\n24.3\nof this Part apply to the offering plan\ngenerally, and shall not be negated or contradicted by inconsistent provisions in other portions of the offering plan, or by provisions purporting to\ndischarge liability or to terminate the continuing effect of representations in the offering plan upon an event such as the closing or the delivery\nof shares with the proprietary lease.
