During the past five (5) years they have produced the following plays: NAME OF PLAY\nOPENING AND CLOSING\nDATES\nNUMBER OF\nPERFORMANCES\nPROFIT OR LOSS PER DOLLAR\nINVESTED\n(If any of the productions listed above are not New York Theatrical Productions, this\nshould be so noted. If desired, additional theatrical experience of the producers may be briefly summarized.)\nTHE CURRENT STATUS OF THE PRODUCTION\nThe producer(s) have entered into a minimum basic production contract with__, the author(s). Under this contract, the play must be produced by __ or the producer(s) will lose all their rights in the play. The author(s) is to receive __% of\ngross weekly box office receipts.

The production company's share\nwill then decrease by __% during each __ year period thereafter until __ years after the close of the run when the partnership will receive nothing\nfrom the sale of subsidiary rights. The author(s) has the sole right to enter into agreements for the sale of subsidiary rights. USE OF PROCEEDS\nThe following represents the estimated use of the proceeds of this offering (before overcall)\nfor pre-production expenses: $__ has currently been advanced by the producer(s). Such amount, as well as any additional\nsuch advances, will be repaid when the partnership is formed (if sooner, so indicate). ESTIMATED WEEKLY BUDGET\nIt is presently contemplated that the weekly budget or \"break even point\" of the play will be\napproximately $ __. The maximum weekly gross of the play is estimated at between $__ and $ __ depending upon the seating capacity of the theatre at\nwhich the play is presented. Based upon present estimates, at capacity approximately $ __ per week will accrue to the partnership as profits. Accordingly, at prevailing ticket prices, taking into consideration presently contemplated payments to the author(s) of the play, theatre, arranger, general partners, director, designers, choreographer and others out of gross weekly box office receipts, the play would have to run a minimum of __\nweeks at full capacity, in order to return to limited partners their contributions. Of course, there can be no assurance that the play will run for\nthat length of time or that it will have audiences of any specified size. Furthermore, additional \"production,\" \"running\" and \"other expenses\" may be\nincurred which would increase the budget, and, consequently, the period of time required to recover invested capital. RIGHTS OF GENERAL AND LIMITED PARTNERS TO RETURN OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND SHARE OF NET\nPROFITS\nNo distributions may be made either of return of contributions or share of net profits until\nthe partnership has paid or provided for its liabilities and has a cash reserve of not less than $ __ as well as a reasonable amount for initial\nexpenses after the original company is sent on tour. (If the producer(s) have the right to accumulate funds for additional road companies or\nfor any other purposes before distributions may be made, this should be stated.)\n\nWhen these conditions are met, contributions are to be\nreturned to limited partners in proportion to their investment until all contributions have been returned. (If contributions of any\ninvestors, including any additional funds supplied by general partners, are to receive priority of return, this should be specifically set\nforth.)\n\nAs long as the necessary conditions set forth above continue to be met, net profits, if any, are to be distributed in the following fashion: __% of all net profits are to be distributed to all limited partners in proportion to their\ncapital contribution and the remaining __% of net profits are to be distributed to the general partners. \"Net profits\" consists of the excess of \"gross receipts\" from any source whatever relating to\nthe play less (a) \"production expenses\" including all expenses and losses actually incurred prior to the New York opening: (b) \"running expenses\"\nincluding all expenses and losses actually incurred in connection with the operation of the play; and (c) \"other expenses\" actually and reasonably\nincurred in connection with the business of the partnership. Upon the closing of all companies presenting the play under the partnership's management and\nthe abandonment of further intention of producing the play, the partnership assets shall be liquidated. Cash proceeds remaining after payment of\nobligations and creation of necessary reserves shall be applied first to repayment of capital not yet returned and then distributed in the same\nmanner as \"net profits.\" In the event additional funds become available from subsidiary rights or otherwise after such liquidation, such funds shall\nbe distributed in the same manner. SHARE OF LOSSES BETWEEN GENERAL AND LIMITED PARTNERS\nBefore net profits have been earned all losses of the partnership shall be borne solely by\nthe limited partners to the extent of their capital contributions. Additional losses shall be borne by the general partners. If net profits have been earned, losses shall first, to the extent of such net profits, be\nborne by both general and limited partners in proportion to their respective interest in such net profits. If any distributions have been made and the partnership does not have sufficient assets to\nmeet obligations and liabilities, the general partners may demand that all partners repay, first any of the net profits distributed to them and if\nadditional funds are necessary to meet obligations, a further demand may be made that limited partners repay contributions previously returned to\nthem without interest. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF GENERAL PARTNERS\nIn addition to the general partners' right to receive __% of all net profits, they have the\nright to and intend to receive a producer's fee of $__ during __ period and further intend to receive a cash office charge for the use of their\noffice facilities at __ of $ __ from each company presenting the play. This sum is payable during the period beginning __ and ending __. The\nproducers office facilities need not be used exclusively for the business of this production. The producer's fee and cash office charge shall be\nconsidered as an expense of the partnership and are payable regardless of whether funds are available for return of contributions or for distribution\nof net profits. (If the general partners, or any entity in which the general partners have a material interest, are to receive any additional\nremuneration in return for additional services to be rendered or materials to be furnished, or if the general partners are to enter into any\nadditional contractual arrangements with the limited partners, those arrangements should be disclosed.)\nTERMINATION OF PARTNERSHIP\nThe partnership shall terminate upon a date to be fixed by the general partners after the\ngeneral partners have abandoned the idea of all further partnership activities. Regardless of the foregoing, the term of the partnership shall come\nto an end on the death or insanity of an individual general partner or the dissolution, liquidation or bankruptcy of a corporate general\npartner.
