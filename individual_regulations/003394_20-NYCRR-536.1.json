  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 536.1 - Penalties and interest\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1142, 1145\n(a) Penalty. Any person failing to file a return or to pay or pay over\nany tax to the Department of Taxation and Finance within the time required by\n\nPart 533 of this Title (determined with regard to any extension of time for\nfiling or paying) shall be subject to a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of\ntax due if such failure is for not more than one month, with an additional one\npercent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure\ncontinues, not exceeding 30 percent in the aggregate. However, where any person\nfails to file a return within 60 days of the date such return was required to\nbe filed (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), the\nminimum penalty for failure to file provided for in the foregoing provisions\nshall not be less than the lesser of $100 or 100 percent of the amount required\nto be shown as tax on such return. The amount of tax required to be shown on\nthe return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid\non or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of\nany credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. In no event, however, shall the penalty for failure to file a return be less than\n$50. (b) Interest. If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date\nthat payment is required, interest shall be paid on such unpaid amount at the\nrate specified in section\n1145 (a)(1)(ii)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw or at the underpayment rate set by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance\n(see Part 2393 of this Title) pursuant to section\n1142 (9)\nof the Tax Law, whichever is greater. Interest shall be paid for the period from the last date\nthat payment is required to the date payment is made, whether or not any\nextension of time for payment was granted. Interest shall not be paid if the\namount thereof is less than one dollar. (c) If a person required to collect tax can\nestablish that the failure or delay to file a return or to pay or pay over any\ntax was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect (see section\n2392.1\nof this\n\nTitle), all of such penalty and that portion of the interest that exceeds the\namount that would be payable if such interest were computed at the underpayment\nrate set by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance (see Part 2393 of this\n\nTitle) pursuant to section\n1142 (9)\nof the Tax Law\nshall be waived. Cross-reference: See section\n2392.1\nof this\n\nTitle for examples of whether reasonable cause and not willful neglect does or\ndoes not exist. Example 1: A review of a vendor's books and records of a retail\nclothing store operation disclosed that the vendor reported a larger amount of\nsales on his Federal income tax return than that reported on his sales and use\ntax return. The review also revealed the vendor made no out-of-state sales and\nexempt sales were minimal. As the vendor did not explain or show reasonable\ncause for the irreconcilable discrepancies, penalty and maximum interest are\ndue on the additional sales and use tax determined. Example 2: In the course of examining, with a third party, information\nsupplied by a liquor store, it was discovered that the liquor store's records\nfailed to disclose a number of different purchases made from its suppliers. Since the records of the liquor were incomplete and inadequate, a mark-up test\nwas performed on purchases from all suppliers. Because the audited taxable\nsales exceeded the taxable sales reported due to the numerous omissions of\nproper recordkeeping, it was evident that not all of the items purchased from\nthe suppliers were included in the vendor's sales records. Because of the\nnature of the understatement of the tax due, it could be concluded that the\nvendor did not make a conscientious and diligent effort to collect and remit\nthe correct amount of tax. Penalty and maximum interest are due because the\nvendor has not shown that reasonable cause existed for the\nunderstatement. Example 3: A vendor who is a manufacturer has continuously filed\ntimely returns. The records indicate that on a prior audit the vendor was\nassessed tax of $75,000 as a result of purchases used by the vendor and\ntherefore subject to tax. The prior audit report disclosed that the vendor was\ninformed of the taxable status of these purchases. The current audit discloses\nthe same type of discrepancies that the prior audit showed. Additional tax of\n$80,000 is determined to be due for the period being audited. Since the vendor\nfailed to pay sales and use tax on these purchases, after having been advised\nof their taxable status on the prior audit, the vendor cannot show reasonable\ncause existed. Therefore, penalty and maximum interest are due. Example 4: A registered vendor is a manufacturer with production\nfacilities located both in and out of New York State. Its corporate\nheadquarters and accounting offices are located outside the State. Audited\nliability consisted of tax due on equipment and various supply items located in\n\nNew York State which were used by it but not used directly in production. The\nvendor made no attempt to determine the taxability of these items in New York\n\nState. The vendor assumed that these items were not taxable because they would\nhave been exempt in the state where the vendor's corporate offices are located. Penalty and maximum interest are due since the vendor has not demonstrated that\nfailure to pay was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful\nneglect. Example 5: A vendor is located outside New York State. Initially the\nonly connection with the State had been soliciting sales by mail and making\ndeliveries by mail of electronics equipment. Gradual expansion of the business\nresulted in providing repairs to the equipment in this State and hiring sales\npersons who solicit sales in New York. The vendor was complying with the\nwithholding tax requirements of the New York State personal income tax but was\nnot a registered vendor and did not file sales and use tax returns. Since the\nvendor failed to comply with the Sales and Use Tax Law, the vendor cannot show\nthat reasonable cause existed. Therefore, penalties and maximum interest are\ndue. Example 6: In an audit conducted for the period December 1, 1980\nthrough November 30, 1983, the auditor found that the vendor had failed to file\na return for the quarter ended August 31, 1983. Accounting records provided\nduring the audit showed recorded taxable sales of $12,000 for the delinquent\nquarter ended August 31, 1983. Reasonable cause existed, as described in\nsection\n2392.1\nof this\n\nTitle, for the waiving of penalty and maximum interest on the tax due for the\nquarter ended August 31, 1983. In addition, the audit results disclosed\nadditional taxable sales of $8,000 for each remaining quarter of the audit\nperiod. The vendor furnished no basis for the department to find that\nreasonable cause existed for not reporting these additional taxable sales for\nsuch quarters. In this situation, penalty and maximum interest would not be\ndetermined on the tax owed on the unreported taxable liability of $12,000 for\nthe delinquent quarter ended August 31, 1983, but would be due on the audited\ntaxable liability of $8,000 for each of the remaining quarters of the audit\nperiod. (d) Rate of\ninterest imposed. Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, the\namount of interest to be added to taxes that are underpaid or overpaid shall be\nbased on the interest rates set by the commissioner (see Part 2393 of this\n\nTitle) that are in effect while such taxes remain underpaid or\noverpaid. (e) Daily\ncompounding of interest. Interest required to be paid either by the department on\noverpayments of sales and use taxes or by the taxpayer on underpayments of\nsales and use taxes shall be compounded daily. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
