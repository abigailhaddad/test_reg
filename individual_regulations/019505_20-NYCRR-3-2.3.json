  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-2.3 - Fair market value\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The fair\nmarket value (FMV) of any asset owned by the taxpayer is the price at which a\nwilling seller, not compelled to sell, will sell and a willing purchaser, not\ncompelled to buy, will buy. (b) The\nFMV, on any date, of stocks, bonds and other securities regularly traded on an\nexchange, or in an over-the-counter market, is the mean between the highest and\nlowest selling prices on that date. If there were no sales on the valuation\ndate, such value is the mean between the highest and the lowest selling prices\non the nearest date, within a reasonable time, on which there were sales. If\nactual sales within a reasonable time are not available, the FMV is the mean\nbetween the bona fide bid and asked prices on the valuation date or the nearest\ndate within a reasonable time. (c) If the actual sales prices or bona fide bid and asked prices within a\nreasonable time are not available, or if, by reason of the character or extent\nof the taxpayer's investments or for any other reason, such prices are not\ntruly indicative of value, the FMV is ascertained as follows: (1)\nin the case of shares of stock, on the\nbasis of the issuing corporation's net worth, earning power, book value, dividends paid, and all other relevant factors; (2)\nin the case of bonds and other\nsecurities, by giving consideration to various factors, including the soundness\nof the security, the interest yield, and the date of maturity. (d) If a taxpayer consistently\ncomputes the FMV of its stocks, bonds and other securities on some other basis, such as the last selling price on the valuation date, such method of valuation\nmay be accepted by the commissioner. In all such cases, a complete explanation\nof the method of valuation must be included with the report. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
