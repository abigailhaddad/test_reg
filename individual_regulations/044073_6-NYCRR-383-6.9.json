  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-6.9 - Coverage requirements for remediation of failures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Proposed coverage requirements. The\napplicant must submit as part of a complete permit application proposed levels\nof coverage for the costs of remediation of failures during the operation, closure, post-closure, and institutional control periods. (1)\n\nThe applicant must provide the following\ndocumentation: (i) the methodologies employed\nand a detailed explanation of the rationale used to select the proposed\nlevels; (ii)\nan evaluation of the\npotential for remediation costs as a result of operation of the land disposal\nfacility including an analysis of the probability and magnitude of these costs\nand the likelihood of exceedence of the proposed costs; and\n(iii)\nevidence that the proposed levels\nreflect the most recent cost data available, adjusted for inflation, where\nappropriate. (2)\n\nThe\napplicant's evaluation of the potential costs for remediation of failures must\nconsider: (i) an analysis of the land\ndisposal facility location including natural site characteristics such as the\ngeologic, geotechnical, hydrologic, meteorologic, climatologic and biotic\nfeatures of the land disposal facility location and vicinity; (ii)\nan analysis of the demographic site\ncharacteristics including population distribution, sensitive areas (including\nbut not limited to hospitals, parks, and schools), and existing and potential\nland use in the vicinity of the land disposal facility; (iii)\nthe disposal technology including the\nfinal design plans and specifications of the land disposal facility; (iv)\nthe types and concentrations of\nradionuclides and the quantities of waste to be located at the land disposal\nfacility; (v) an analysis of\nprobability and consequences of accidental scenarios including but not limited\nto, explosion, fire, vehicular accidents, and processing accidents, which may\nresult in remediation costs; (vi)\nan analysis of major natural phenomena which may result in remediation\ncosts; (vii)\nan analysis of impacts\ndue to inadvertent intrusion; and\n(viii)\nthe proposed time period of\noperations. (3)\n\nThe\napplicant's evaluation of the potential costs for remediation of failures must\nrely upon: (i) location-specific and disposal\ntechnology-specific performance assessment modelling; (ii)\nlocation-specific and disposal\ntechnology-specific dose assessment modelling; (iii)\nrisk assessment of the major events or\nphenomena which may affect cost; (iv)\nas assessment of expected radiological\nexposures and doses due to potential accidents or major events or phenomena or\nwaste processing during the land disposal facility life; (v) an assessment of the potential health\neffects (including stochastic and nonstochastic effects) resulting from such\nexposures and doses which must reflect current data concerning the biological\neffects of ionizing radiation; and\n(iv)\ncomputer-based mathematical models. The applicant must submit detailed\nexplanations of all calculations performed and details of all models used, including all assumptions and algorithms to the satisfaction of the\ndepartment. (4)\n\nThe applicant must demonstrate to the\nsatisfaction of the department that the coverage levels reflect due\nconsideration of: the sizes and locations of affected facilities; the nature\nand volume of the low-level radioactive waste involved; the types of facilities\nand the degrees and durations of risk to human health and the environment; and\nthe protection of public health and safety and the environment. (b) Coverage requirements during\nthe operation, closure, and post-closure period. Every applicant or permittee\nmust establish and maintain financial assurance as required by section\n383-6.3\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart in at least the amount of coverage approved by the commissioner\npursuant to subdivision (a) of this section to ensure the remediation of\nfailures during the operation, closure, and post-closure periods of the land\ndisposal facility. Every applicant and permittee must submit proof of such\nfinancial assurance to the department as required by section\n383-6.3\n(b)(3) and\n(d) of this Subpart. (c) Coverage requirements during the\ninstitutional control period. Every applicant or permittee must establish and\nmaintain financial assurance as required by section\n383-6.3\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart in at least the amount of coverage approved by the commissioner\npursuant to subdivision (a) of this section to ensure the remediation of\nfailures during the institutional control period of the land disposal facility. Every applicant or permittee must submit proof of such financial assurance to\nthe department as required by section 383- 6.3(b)(4) and (d) of this\n\nSubpart. (d) Requirements for\nreassessing degree and duration of risk. (1)\n\nDuring the operation, closure, and post-closure periods of the land disposal\nfacility the permittee must notify the department of any circumstances or\nevents which may impact financial assurance coverage levels. Within 30 days of\nthe discovery of such circumstance or occurrence of such event, the permittee\nmust submit to the department, in writing, an assessment and report of any\nchanges in the degree and duration of risk to human health and the environment\ncreated by the circumstance or event. (2)\n\nThe department may require the permittee\nto submit any additional information necessary to determine if the amount of\nfinancial assurance required for remediation of failures must be adjusted as a\nresult of the circumstance or event. (e) Adjusting the coverage requirements. (1)\n\nDuring the pre-closure period of the land\ndisposal facility, the department may adjust the amount of financial assurance\nthe permittee must provide for remediation of failures if the amount of\nfinancial assurance required by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section does not\nreflect the current degree and duration of risk to human health and the\nenvironment presented by the land disposal facility. (2)\n\nDuring the pre-closure period the\ndepartment may adjust the amount of financial assurance required for\nremediation of failures to account for inflation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n383-6.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
