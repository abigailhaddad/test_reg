  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 80.4 - Procedures for obtaining access to records\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe procedures for obtaining access are designed to insure\nfull compliance with the letter and intent of the Freedom of Information Law, as well as providing the public with optimum response to their requests. (a) A public catalogue consisting of a list\nby subject matter of the records of the Department of Civil Service will be\navailable for inspection at the main reception desk of the Department of Civil\n\nService on the State Campus in Albany and at the department's New York City and\n\nBuffalo offices. (b) Any person\nwishing to inspect and/or obtain a copy of any record listed in the catalogue\nshould make application in duplicate to the records access officer on the form\nentitled, \"Application for Public Access to Records\". This form may be obtained\neither personally from the receptionist at the main reception desk of the\n\nDepartment of Civil Service in Albany, and at the department's New York City\nand Buffalo offices or by mail sent to the records access officer at his\nbusiness address. Submission of the application for public access to records\nform will not be required for materials which have been customarily made\nreadily available to the public by the department without written requests, such as examination announcements, brochures, etc. The records access officer\nmay in his discretion provide access to records as the circumstances dictate\nwithout requiring the use of the public access to records application\nform. (c) Completed copies of the\napplication for public access to records may be either delivered personally to\nthe receptionist at the main reception desk of the Department of Civil Service\nin Albany who will then forward them to the records access officer or mailed\ndirectly to the records access officer at his business address. (d) The application for public access to\nrecords should be reasonably described by the requester to enable the\ndepartment to locate the records requested within the five business day time\nlimit mandated by law. Where possible, the requester should supply information\nregarding dates, titles, file designation or other information which may help\nthe department identify the records. The records access officer shall see to it\nthat agency personnel assist the requester in identifying requested records, if\nnecessary. If, however, the department is unable to locate a requested record\nwithin five business days because it is unable to identify the record, the\ndepartment shall so inform the person requesting such record. (e) A request for any or all records falling\nwithin a specific category shall conform to the standard that records be\nidentifiable. (f) No records shall\nbe removed by any person requesting access to records from any office within\nthe Department of Civil Service where such record may be located without the\nexpress consent in writing of the head of the Department of Civil\n\nService.
