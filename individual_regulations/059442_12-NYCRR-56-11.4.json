  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-11.4 - Pre-demolition asbestos abatement projects\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following Phase II abatement procedure modifications\nshall apply for building/structures planned for demolition. All ACM, PACM or\nasbestos material must be removed from a building/ structure and the asbestos\nproject complete, prior to commencement of demolition activities. (a) Air sampling and analysis. Air sampling and analysis on an asbestos projects\nconducted under this section shall be conducted in accordance with the\nrequirements of Subpart 56-4 of this Part. (b) Regulated abatement work area\npreparation. Regulated abatement work area preparation shall be as per\n\nSubpart 56-7 of this Part, except as follows: (1)\n\nTiming-removal of salvage. Objects that\ncan be removed from the regulated abatement work area without disturbing\nfriable ACM prior to beginning Phase II B abatement procedures shall be\ncompleted as follows. The removal of nonporous, movable or non-movable salvage\nshall occur after critical barriers, isolation barriers and decontamination\nenclosures are in place in that portion of the building or structure, and only\nafter salvage has been wet-cleaned and HEPA-vacuumed. (2)\n\nFloor, wall and ceiling plasticizing and\nsealing. All porous floor, wall and ceiling surfaces, except where abatement of\nACM, PACM or asbestos material shall be performed on those specific surfaces, shall be covered with one layer of, at a minimum, six mil fire-retardant\nplastic sheeting. The floor shall be plasticized first, and its plastic\nsheeting shall extend up the walls a distance of at least 12 inches on all\nsides. The walls shall then be plasticized by applying plastic sheeting from\nthe ceiling to the floor, overlapping the floor sheeting by at least 12 inches. Next, the ceiling shall be plasticized, overlapping the walls by at least 12\ninches, to form a secure airtight seam. If the floor surface is not to be\nplasticized, it shall be made watertight. All seams in the plastic shall be\nsealed watertight and airtight. (3)\n\nSuspended ceilings. Suspended ceiling tiles and T-grid components in proximity\nto friable ACM shall remain in place until the regulated abatement work area\nhas been fully prepared in accordance with this section, and electrical and\nHVAC systems have been shut down. These potentially contaminated suspended\nceiling components shall be removed at the completion of the remaining work\narea preparation, including establishment of negative air ventilation systems, prior to commencement of Phase II B activities. These removed ceiling\ncomponents shall be bagged/containerized and disposed of as asbestos waste. Critical barriers shall be installed above the suspended ceiling as per section\n56-7.11\n(a) of\nthis Part, prior to the commencement of Phase II B abatement. (4)\n\nElevators. Elevators running through the\nregulated abatement work area shall conform to the following: (i) The elevator door in the regulated\nabatement work area shall be enclosed per section\n56-7.11\n(d) of\nthis Part. (ii)\n\nElevators not\nremaining in use shall have the fuses removed and the power switch locked in\nthe open position. (iii)\n\nElevator\nshafts shall not be used as waste chutes for asbestos waste material. (iv)\n\nElevators that remain in use shall\nconform to the additional procedures to minimize the piston effects. (a) Elevator controls shall be modified to\nbypass the regulated abatement work area. (b) A third (final) layer of polyethylene is\nto be duct taped airtight but with slack so as to form a larger perimeter\ndiaphragm. Air leakage across the barrier shall be corrected upon discovery, and the elevator shaft shall be checked for airborne asbestos contamination. If\ncontamination is found in this area, the entire affected area shall be\nwet-cleaned prior to continuing any other work. (c) This system shall be smoke tested\ndaily. (c) Removal. Removal of ACM, PACM and asbestos material shall proceed\nas per the requirements of Subpart 56-8 of this Part. (d) Final cleaning and clearance\nprocedures. Final clean-up and clearance procedures for\npre-demolition abatement shall comply with Subpart 56-9 of this Part, except\nthat only two stages of cleaning (first and final) are to performed. Lockdown\nencapsulant use shall be consistent with section\n56-9.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (e) Final waste\nremoval from the site. The requirements of Subpart 56-10 of this Part shall\napply, once all asbestos project regulated abatement work areas have been\ncompleted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-11.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
