  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-6.1 - Applicability\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe requirements of this Subpart apply to the\nconstruction and/or operation of any proposed modification at an existing major\nfacility located in a nonattainment area, or an attainment area of the State\nwithin the ozone transport region as follows: (a) For a modification with a project\nemission potential, calculated utilizing projected actual emissions, which does\nnot equal or exceed the applicable significant project threshold in table 3 or\ntable 4 of Subpart 231-13 of this Part, the facility owner or operator must\ncomply with the provisions of section\n231-11.2\nof this Part. (b) For a modification with a project\nemission potential which equals or exceeds the applicable significant project\nthreshold in table 3 or table 4 of Subpart 231-13 of this Part, but does not\nresult in a NSR major modification, the facility owner or operator must comply\nwith the provisions of section\n231-6.2\nof this Subpart. (c) For a modification which the facility\ndetermines will result in a NSR major modification, the facility owner or\noperator must comply with the provisions of this Subpart as\nappropriate. (d) 'Special\napplicability rules for modifications of existing major facilities in severe\nozone non attainment areas'. (1)\n\nModifications of facilities emitting less than 100 tpy. In the case of any\nmajor facility of VOC or NO\nx\n(other than a facility\nwhich emits or has the potential to emit 100 tpy or more of VOC or\nNO\nx\n), whenever any modification at the facility results\nin a NSR major modification of VOC or NO\nx\nfrom any\ndiscrete operation, emission source, or other regulated NSR contaminant\nemitting activity at the facility, such emission increase shall be considered\nas a modification for purposes of requiring a permit under this Part, except\nthat such increase shall not be considered a modification for such purposes if\nthe owner or operator of the facility elects to offset the emission increase by\na greater reduction in emissions of VOC or NO\nx, as\napplicable, from other operations, emission sources, or activities within the\nfacility at an internal offset ratio of at least 1.3 to 1. If the owner or\noperator does not make such election, the modification shall be considered a\nNSR major modification for such purposes, but in applying control requirements, BACT shall be substituted for LAER. (2)\n\nModifications of facilities emitting 100\ntpy or more. In the case of any major facility of VOC or\nNO\nx\nwhich emits or has the potential to emit 100 tpy or\nmore of VOC or NO\nx\nwhenever any modification at the\nfacility results in a NSR major modification of VOC or\nNO\nx\nfrom any discrete operation, emission source, or\nother contaminant emitting activity at the facility, such emission increase\nshall be considered a modification for purposes of requiring a permit under\nthis Part, except that if the owner or operator of the facility elects to\noffset the emission increase by a greater reduction in emissions of VOC or\nNO\nx, as applicable, from other operations, emission\nsources, or activities within the facility at an internal offset ratio of at\nleast 1.3 to 1, the requirements of LAER shall not apply.
