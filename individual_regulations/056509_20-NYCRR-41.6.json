  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 41.6 - Rented real property and tangible personal property\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In computing the property factor, real\nproperty and tangible personal property rented to the taxpayer must be\nincluded. The average value of real property and tangible personal property, both within and without New York State, which is rented to the taxpayer is\ndetermined by multiplying gross rents payable during the period covered by the\nreturn by eight. (b) The term gross\nrents as used in this section means the actual sum of money or other\nconsideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer or for its\nbenefit for the use or possession of the property and includes: (1)\n\nAny amount payable for the use or\npossession of real property or tangible personal property, or any part thereof, whether designated as a fixed sum of money or as a percentage of sales, profits\nor otherwise. Example 1:A taxpayer, pursuant to the terms of a lease, pays the lessor $1,000 per month and at the end of the year pays the lessor one\npercent of its gross sales at that location. Its gross sales were $400,000, resulting in a gross rent of $16,000. (2)\n\nAny amount payable as additional rent or\nin lieu of rent, such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs or any other\namount required to be paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangement. Example 2:A taxpayer, pursuant to the terms of a lease, pays its lessor $24,000 a year. It also pays real estate taxes of $4,000 and\ninterest on a mortgage in the amount of $2,000. The taxpayer's gross rent is\n$30,000. (3)\nA\nproportionate part of the cost of any improvement to real property or tangible\npersonal property made by or on behalf of the taxpayer which reverts to the\nowner or lessor upon termination of a lease or other arrangement. The amount to\nbe included in gross rents is based on the unexpired term of the lease\ncommencing with the date the improvement is completed or the life of the\nimprovement if its life expectancy is less than the unexpired term of the\nlease. However, where a building is erected on leased land by or on behalf of\nthe taxpayer, the value of the land is determined by multiplying the gross rent\nby eight, and the value of the building is determined in the same manner as if\nowned by the taxpayer. The proportionate part of the cost of an improvement\n(other than a building on leased land) is generally equal to the amount of\namortization allowed in accordance with its regular accounting practices, regardless of whether the lease contains an option for renewal. Example 3:A taxpayer enters into a 21-year lease of certain\npremises at a rental of $20,000 per year. After the expiration of one year, it\ninstalls a new storefront at a cost of $10,000, which reverts to the owner upon\nthe expiration of the lease. Its gross rent for the first year is $20,000. However, for subsequent years its gross rent is $20,500 ($20,000 annual rent\nplus 1/20th of $10,000, the cost of the improvement apportioned on the basis of\nthe unexpired term of the lease). Example 4:A taxpayer leases a parcel of vacant land for 40\nyears at an annual rental of $5,000, and erects a building on the land which\ncosts $600,000. The value of the land is determined by multiplying the annual\nrent of $5,000 by eight. The value of the building is $600,000. (c) The term gross\nrents does not include: (1)\namounts payable\nfor storage, providing such amounts are payable for space not designated and\nnot under the control of the taxpayer; (2)\namounts payable as separate charges for\nwater and electric service furnished by the lessor; or\n(3)\nthat portion of any rental payment which\nis applicable to the space subleased from the taxpayer and not used by it. Example 5:A taxpayer leases a building at an annual rental\nof $20,000. The taxpayer subleases 40 percent of such building to one or more\nsubtenants. Since 40 percent of the rent paid by the taxpayer is applicable to\nthe portion of the building subleased, 40 percent of the rent, or $8,000, is\nexcluded in computing the taxpayer's gross rent for the building. Regardless of\nthe amount of rent received by the taxpayer from the sublease, the amount to be\nexcluded in computing the property factor is $8,000. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
