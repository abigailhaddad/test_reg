  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 117.5 - New York State personal income tax avoidance or evasion\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 617(c)\n(a) If a partnership agreement provides for an allocation of any item of partnership income, gain, loss or deduction to a partner but the allocation does not have substantial economic effect in accordance with section\n704(b)\nof the Internal Revenue Code, the allocation shall be disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. In such a case, a partner's distributive share of such item is determined in accordance with the partner's interest in the partnership (determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances). This treatment and distribution of the item is reflected in each partner's Federal adjusted gross income and therefore in each partner's NewYork adjusted gross income, even if no New York State personal income tax avoidance or evasion may be involved. (b) An allocation of an item, amount or activity, even if recognized for Federal income tax purposes, will not be recognized where it has as a principal purpose the avoidance or evasion of New York State personal income tax. Where an allocation is not recognized, the partner's distributive share shall be determined in accordance with the partner's interest in the partnership (determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances). (c) The determination of whether a principal purpose of an allocation of an item, amount or activity is the avoidance or evasion of New York State personal income tax depends on all the surrounding facts and circumstances. Among the relevant circumstances to be considered are the following: (1)\nwhether the partnership or a partner individually has a business purpose for the allocation; (2)\nwhether the allocation has substantial economic effect, that is, whether the allocation may actually affect the dollar amount of the partners' shares of the total partnership income or loss independently of the New York State personal income tax consequences; (3)\nwhether the related items of partnership income, gain, loss or deduction from the same source are subject to the same allocation; (4)\nwhether the allocation was made without recognition of normal business factors and only after the amount of the allocated item could reasonably be estimated; (5)\nthe duration of the allocation; and\n(6)\nthe overall New York State personal income tax consequences of the allocation.
