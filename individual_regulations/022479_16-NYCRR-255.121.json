  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.121 - Design of plastic pipe\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Design pressure. Design pressure for plastic pipe is\ndetermined in accordance with either of the following formulas: P =\n2StDF\n/\n(D-\nt)\nP =\n2SDF\n/\n(SDR -\n1)\n\nWhere: P = Design pressure, gauge, psig (kPa). S = For thermoplastic pipe, the hydrostatic design basis\n(HDB) is determined in accordance with the listed specification at a\ntemperature equal to 73°F (23°C), 100°F (38°C), 120°F\n(49°C), or 140°F (60°C). In the absence of an HDB established at\nthe specified temperature, the HDB of a higher temperature may be used in\ndetermining a design pressure rating at the specified temperature by arithmetic\ninterpolation using the procedure in Part D.2 of PPI TR-3/2012, (incorporated\nby reference, see section\n255.7\nof this Part). For\nreinforced thermosetting plastic pipe, 11,000 psig (75,842 kPa). t = Specified wall thickness, inches (mm). D = Specified outside diameter, inches (mm). SDR = Standard dimension ratio, the ratio of the average\nspecified outside diameter to the minimum specified wall thickness, corresponding to a value from a common numbering system that was derived from\nthe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) preferred number series\n10. DF = Design Factor, a maximum of 0.32 unless otherwise\nspecified for a particular material in this section. (b) General requirements for plastic\npipe and components. (1)\n\nExcept as\nprovided in subdivisions (c) through (f) of this section, the design pressure\nfor plastic pipe may not exceed a gauge pressure of 100 psig (689 kPa) for pipe\nused in: (i) distribution systems; or\n(ii)\ntransmission lines in Class\n3 and 4 locations. (2)\n\nPlastic pipe may not be used where operating temperatures of the pipe will be: (i) below -20°F (-29°C), or below\n-40°F (-40°C) if all pipe and pipeline components whose operating\ntemperature will be below -20°F (-29°C) have a temperature rating by\nthe manufacturer consistent with that operating temperature; or\n(ii)\nabove the temperature at which the HDB\nused in the design formula under this section is determined. (3)\n\nUnless specified for a\nparticular material in this section, the wall thickness of plastic pipe may not\nbe less than 0.062 inches (1.57 millimeters). (4)\n\nAll plastic pipe must have a listed HDB\nin accordance with PPI TR-4/2012 (incorporated by reference, see section\n255.7\nof this\n\nPart). (c) Polyethylene (PE) pipe requirements. (1)\n\nFor PE pipe produced after July 14, 2004, but before January 22, 2019, a design pressure of up to 125 psig may be used, provided: (i) the material designation code is\nPE2406 or PE3408; (ii)\nthe pipe has\na nominal size (iron pipe size [IPS] or copper tubing size [CTS]) of 12 inches\nor less (above nominal pipe size of 12 inches, the design pressure is limited\nto 100 psig); and\n(iii)\nthe wall\nthickness is not less than 0.062 inches (1.57 millimeters). (2)\n\nFor PE pipe produced on or\nafter January 22, 2019, a DF of 0.40 may be used in the design formula, provided: (i) The design pressure does not\nexceed 125 psig; (ii)\n\nThe material\ndesignation code is PE2708 or PE4710; (iii)\n\nThe pipe has a nominal size (IPS or\nCTS) of 24 inches or less; and\n(iv)\n\nThe wall thickness for a given outside diameter is not less than that listed in\nthe following table: PE Pipe: Minimum Wall Thickness and SDR\nPipe Size (inches) SDR (values)\n\nMinimum wall thickness (inches)\n\nCorresponding\n1/2\" CTS\n0.090\n7\n3/4\" CTS\n0.090\n9.7\n1/2\" IPS\n0.090\n9.3\n3/4\" IPS\n0.095\n11\n1\" CTS\n0.119\n11\n1\" IPS\n0.119\n11\n1-1/4\" IPS\n0.151\n11\n1-1/2\" IPS\n0.173\n11\n2\"\n0.216\n11\n3\"\n0.259\n13.5\n4\"\n0.265\n17\n6\"\n0.315\n21\n8\"\n0.411\n21\n10\"\n0.512\n21\n12\"\n0.607\n21\n16\"\n0.762\n21\n18\"\n0.857\n21\n20\"\n0.952\n21\n22\"\n1.048\n21\n24\"\n1.143\n21\n(d) Polyamide (PA-11) pipe\nrequirements.
