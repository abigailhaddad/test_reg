  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 605.2 - Availability of services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\nrequirements. Telephone corporations operating as common carriers must provide\npublicly offered conduit services on demand to any similarly situated user on\nsubstantially similar terms, subject to the availability of facilities and\ncapacity. Such services shall be provided by a telephone corporation on a\nfirst-come, first-served basis unless a party is able to show in a timely\nfashion that such provision would be unreasonable or unless otherwise ordered\nby the commission. Additionally: (1)\nconduit\nservices shall be made available as services separate from the provision of\ncontent; (2)\ninterconnection into\nthe networks of telephone corporations shall be provided for other public or\nprivate networks; and\n(3)\nsegregable services and functions requested by users shall be provided to the\nextent technically and economically practicable. (b) Restrictions on network use. No telephone\ncorporation operating as a common carrier shall unreasonably restrict lawful\nnetwork. No restriction may impede access between a content service provider\nand a willing customer, except where required by law. All restrictions shall be\nadministered in a least restrictive fashion. (1)\n\nRequirements by telephone corporations on\nusers for prior subscription to a particular content services will generally be\npermissible only where requested by the provider of the service, or required by\nlaw, or where a waiver is granted. (2)\n\nEnd-user initiated blocking shall always\nbe available for content services, to the extent technically and economically\nfeasible. (c) Video\nconduit services. To the extent that a telephone corporation may provide video\nconduit services, it may do so only so long as it provides adequate capacity to\ncontent service providers seeking its video conduit services, and treats all\nusers in a nondiscriminatory fashion. (d) Individualized contracts. Where permitted\nby the commission, individualized contracts may be offered by telephone\ncorporations operating as common carriers, so long as similarly situated\ncustomers are provided, upon request, service upon substantially similar terms. Such contracts may not be used to avoid common carrier obligations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n605.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
