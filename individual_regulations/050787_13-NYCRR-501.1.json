(b) When the CRB\ndetermines that a response on the merits of a submitted change is improper, the\nCRB may waive the procedural requirements stated in section\n17-210(4)\nof the\n\nElection Law and notify the submitter that the submission will not be\nconsidered on the merits. Such notification shall be given within the review\nperiod that would have commenced for a determination on the merits and shall\ninclude an explanation of the reason why a response is improper. (c) If, following a notification by the CRB\nthat a submission was improper for consideration on the merits, new information\nor a change in circumstances renders the covered policy appropriate for review\non the merits, such covered policy must be submitted for preclearance review. Such submission must include a description of the new information or\ncircumstances, such as a notification from the submitting authority that a\ncovered policy previously determined to be premature has been formally adopted. Notice of the resubmission will be given to interested parties registered under\nsubparagraph 501.1(c)(11)(i) of this section.

(b) Requests for additional\ninformation\n(1)\n\nIf the CRB determines\nthat a submission does not satisfy the requirements of subdivision 501.1(a) of\nthis section, the CRB may request, orally or in writing, any omitted\ninformation necessary for the evaluation of the submission. The request shall\nadvise the covered entity that preclearance may be denied if the information is\nnot provided in a timely manner. (2)\n\nThe CRB shall notify the submitting\nauthority that the review period for the submission is tolled as of the date of\nthe request, and that a new review period will commence upon the CRB's receipt\nof a response from the submitting authority that provides the information\nrequested or demonstrates, as determined at the sole discretion of the CRB, that the submitting authority exercised due diligence and was unable to obtain\nthe information. (3)\n\nAn oral\nrequest for information shall not limit the authority of the CRB to make a\nwritten request for information. (4)\n\nIf the request was in writing, a copy of\nthe request, and notice of the CRB's receipt of information pursuant to such\nrequest, will be given to any party who has commented on the submission, and to\ninterested parties registered under subparagraph 501.1(c)(11)(i) of this\nsection. (5)\n\nWhere the response\nfrom the submitting authority neither provides the information requested nor\ndemonstrates, as determined at the sole discretion of the CRB, that the\nsubmitting authority exercised due diligence and was unable to obtain the\ninformation, such response will be deemed insufficient and shall not commence a\nnew review period. The CRB shall notify the submitting authority that its\nresponse is insufficient. Such notification shall be provided as soon as\npossible within the review period that would have commenced had the response\nbeen sufficient. (6)\n\nIf, after a\nrequest for further information is made pursuant to this clause, the CRB\nreceives the requested information from a source other than the submitting\nauthority, the CRB shall promptly notify the submitting authority, and the new\nreview period shall commence the day after the information is received by the\nCRB. (7)\n\nIf after 60 days the\nsubmitting authority has not provided a sufficient response to a request made\npursuant to this section, the CRB, absent extenuating circumstances and\nconsistent with the burden of proof under section\n17-210\nof the\n\nElection Law and as described in section 501.2(e) of this Part, may deny\npreclearance. (iii)\n\nOther interested parties\n(a) The CRB may at any time request relevant\ninformation from governmental jurisdictions and from interested individuals and\nentities and may conduct any independent analysis that it deems appropriate in\nits discretion in making a determination. (b) The CRB shall have the discretion to call\nto the attention of the submitting authority or any interested individual or\nentity information or comments related to a\nsubmission. (5)\n\nPreclearance report and determination\n(i) The CRB shall, within the review period\nprovided in section\n17-210(4)(f)\nof the\n\nElection Law and as further provided in this title, issue a written report and\ndetermination as to whether preclearance of the covered policy should be\ngranted or denied. (ii)\n\nIf\npreclearance is denied, the report and determination shall include an\nexplanation of the basis for the denial and shall advise the submitting\nauthority that it may institute a special proceeding in the Supreme Court of\n\nNew York for the County of New York or Albany to appeal the denial, pursuant to\n\nArticle 78 of the CPLR. (iii)\n\nIf\npreclearance is granted, the report and determination shall state that the\nCRB's grant of preclearance does not bar subsequent litigation by other parties\nto enjoin the enactment or implementation of the covered policy. (iv)\n\nThe decision of the CRB to grant\npreclearance is not reviewable. (v) A copy of the report and determination shall be sent to any party who has\ncommented on the submission, and to interested parties registered under\nsubparagraph 501.1(c)(11)(i) of this section. (6)\n\nWithdrawal\n(i) A covered entity may withdraw a\nsubmission at any time prior to a final decision by the CRB. Notice of the\nwithdrawal must be made in writing, addressed to the Section Chief, Voting\n\nRights, Civil Rights Bureau. The submission shall be deemed withdrawn upon the\nCRB's receipt of the notice. (ii)\n\nNotice of withdrawals will be given to interested parties registered under\nsubparagraph 501.1(c)(11)(i) of this section. (7)\n\nFailure to respond. Pursuant\nto section\n17-210(3)(e)(iii)\nof the\n\nElection Law, the failure of the CRB to provide a report and determination\nwithin the prescribed review period constitutes preclearance of the submitted\nchange, provided that such review period had commenced after receipt by the CRB\nof a complete submission that is appropriate for a response on the\nmerits. (8)\n\nFile maintenance; record retention. The CRB shall maintain copies of preclearance\nsubmissions, reports, and determinations in compliance with applicable record\nretention requirements, including but not limited to the Freedom of Information\n\nLaw, N.Y. Public officers Law § 84\net seq.
