(b) Policy practices and provisions. (1)\n(i) Every Medicare supplement insurance policy must be guaranteed renewable. Subject to a group policyholder's right to terminate coverage, the term guaranteed renewable as used in this section means that the insured has the right to continue the Medicare supplement insurance in force by the timely payment of premiums and the issuer has no unilateral right to make any change in any provision of the policy or certificate while the insurance is in force except to: (a) change benefits designed to cover cost-sharing amounts under Medicare to coincide with any changes in the applicable Medicare deductible amount and copayment percentage factors; (b) amend the policy to meet minimum standards for Medicare supplement insurance; or\n(c) revise premium rates on a class basis. (ii)\n\nIf a group Medicare supplement insurance policy provides for termination of the policy by the group policyholder then the Medicare supplement certificate shall prominently display notification of such termination right on the first page. (2)\n\nMedicare supplement policies and certificates shall include a renewal or continuation provision. The language or specifications of such provision shall be consistent with the type of contract issued. Such provision shall be appropriately captioned and shall appear on the first page of the policy or certificate and shall include any reservation by the issuer of the right to change premiums. (3)\n(i) Notwithstanding section\n52.16\n(c) of this Title, the only permissible preexisting condition limitations applicable to Medicare supplement insurance are ones which exclude coverage, for no more than six months after the effective date of coverage under the policy or certificate, for a condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician, within six months before the effective date of the coverage. (ii)\n\nIn applying a preexisting condition limitation to a covered person, an issuer shall credit the time the person was previously covered under creditable coverage, including Medicare supplement insurance, Medicare select coverage and Medicare advantage plans, if the previous creditable coverage was continuous to a date not more than 63 days prior to the enrollment date of the new coverage. For purposes of this paragraph, enrollment date means the first day of coverage of the individual under the policy or certificate or, if earlier, the first day of the waiting period that must pass with respect to an individual before such individual is eligible to be covered for benefits. Any period after the date the individual files a substantially complete application for coverage and before the first day of coverage is a waiting period. (iii)\n\nFor purposes of applying the credit of creditable coverage, an issuer shall reduce the period of any preexisting condition limitation by the aggregate of the period of creditable coverage without regard to the specific benefits covered during the period. (iv)\n\nIf a Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate contains any limitations with respect to preexisting conditions, such limitations shall appear as a separate paragraph of the policy or certificate and be labeled as \"Pre-existing Condition Limitations.''\n(4)\n\nExcept for permitted preexisting condition limitations as described in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, no policy or certificate may be advertised, solicited, delivered or issued for delivery in this State as a Medicare supplement policy if such policy or certificate contains limitations or exclusions on coverage that are more restrictive than those of Medicare. (5)\n\nNo Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate in force in this State shall contain benefits that duplicate benefits provided by Medicare. (6)\nA Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not indemnify against losses resulting from sickness on a different basis than losses resulting from accidents. (7)\nA Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits designed to cover cost-sharing amounts under Medicare will be changed automatically to coincide with any changes in the applicable Medicare deductible amount and co-payment percentage factors. Premiums may be changed to correspond with such changes, subject to approval by the superintendent. (8)\n\nMedicare supplement insurance policies or certificates shall not provide for the payment of benefits based on standards described as \"usual and customary,'' \"reasonable and customary'' or words of similar import. (9)\n\nAn issuer shall provide, prior to its use, a copy of any advertisement for a Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate intended for use in this State whether through written, radio or television medium to the superintendent for review. Such advertisement shall comply with all applicable regulations and laws of this State. (10)\n\nExcept for riders or endorsements by which the issuer effectuates a request made in writing by the insured, exercises a specifically reserved right under a Medicare supplement policy, or is required to reduce or eliminate benefits to avoid duplication of Medicare benefits, all riders or endorsements added to a Medicare supplement policy after date of issue or at reinstatement or renewal which reduce or eliminate benefits or coverage in the policy shall require a signed acceptance by the insured. After the date of policy or certificate issue, any rider or endorsement which increases benefits or coverage with a concomitant increase in premium during the policy term shall be agreed to in writing signed by the insured, unless the benefits are required by the minimum standards for Medicare supplement insurance, or if the increased benefits or coverage is required by law. Where a separate additional premium is charged for benefits provided in connection with riders or endorsements, such premium charge shall be set forth in the policy. (11)\n\nMedicare supplement policies and certificates shall have a notice prominently printed on the first page of the policy or certificate or attached thereto stating in substance that the policyholder or certificateholder shall have the right to return the policy or certificate within 30 days of its delivery to the policyholder or certificateholder and to receive a full refund of any premium paid therefor including any policy fees or other charges. (12)\n(i) Subject to subdivision (c) of this section, a Medicare supplement policy with benefits for outpatient prescription drugs in existence prior to January 1, 2006 shall be renewed at the option of the policyholder for current policyholders who do not enroll in Part D. (ii)\nA Medicare supplement policy with benefits for outpatient prescription drugs shall not be issued after December 31, 2005. (iii)\n\nAfter December 31, 2005, a Medicare supplement policy with benefits for outpatient prescription drugs may not be renewed after the policyholder enrolls in Medicare Part D unless: (a) the policy is modified to eliminate outpatient prescription coverage for expenses of outpatient prescription drugs incurred after the effective date of the individual's coverage under a Part D plan; and\n(b) premiums are adjusted to reflect the elimination of outpatient prescription drug coverage at the time of Medicare Part D enrollment, accounting for any claims paid, if applicable. (13)\n\nIf a Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate eliminates an outpatient prescription during benefit as a result of requirements imposed by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the modified policy or certificate shall be deemed to satisfy the guaranteed renewal requirements of this subdivision. (c) Termination; conversion; continuation; suspension and reinstitution of coverage; extension of benefits. (1)\n\nAn issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew a Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate for any reason other than nonpayment of premium or material misrepresentation. (2)\n\nAn issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew a Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate on the ground of health status of the insured. (3)\n\nNo Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate shall provide for termination of coverage of a spouse solely because of the occurrence of an event specified for termination of coverage of the insured, other than the nonpayment of premium. (4)\n\nIf a group Medicare supplement insurance policy is replaced by another group Medicare supplement insurance policy purchased by the same policyholder, the issuer of the replacement policy shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the old group policy on its date of termination. (5)\n\nIf a group Medicare supplement insurance policy is terminated by the group policyholder and not replaced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, the issuer shall offer certificateholders an individual Medicare supplement insurance policy which (at the option of the certificateholder): (i) provides for the same level of benefits contained in the group policy; or\n(ii)\nprovides for benefits that otherwise meet the requirements of this section. (6)\n\nIf an individual is a certificateholder in a group Medicare supplement insurance policy and the individual terminates membership in the group, the issuer shall: (i) offer the certificateholder the conversion opportunities described in paragraph (5) of this subdivision; or\n(ii)\nat the option of the group policyholder, offer the certificateholder continuation of coverage under the group policy. (7)\n(i) A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy or certificate shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder or certificateholder for the period (not to exceed 24 months) in which the policyholder or certificateholder has applied for and is determined to be entitled to medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act, but only if the policyholder or certificateholder notifies the issuer of such policy or certificate within 90 days after the date the individual becomes entitled to such assistance. Upon receipt of timely notice, the issuer shall return to the policyholder or certificateholder that portion of the premium attributable to the period of Medicaid eligibility, subject to adjustment for paid claims. (ii)\n\nIf such suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificateholder loses entitlement to such medical assistance, such policy or certificate shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of termination of such entitlement) as of the termination of such entitlement if the policyholder or certificateholder provides notice of loss of such entitlement within 90 days after the date of such loss and pays the premium attributable to the period, effective as of the date of termination of such entitlement. (iii)\n\nEach Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy or certificate shall be suspended (for any period that may be provided by Federal regulation) at the request of the policyholder or certificateholder if the policyholder or certificateholder is entitled to benefits under 42 U.S.C. section\n426(b)\nand is covered under a group health plan (as defined in 42 U.S.C. section\n1395\ny [b][1][A][v]). If suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificateholder loses coverage under the group health plan, the policy or certificate shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of loss of coverage) if the policyholder or certificateholder provides notice of loss of coverage within 90 days after the date of the loss and pays the premium attributable to the period, effective as of the date of termination of enrollment in the group health plan. (iv)\n\nReinstitution of such coverages: (a) shall not provide for any waiting period with respect to treatment of preexisting conditions; (b) shall provide for resumption of coverage that is substantially equivalent to coverage in effect before the date of such suspension. If the suspended Medicare supplement policy provided coverage for outpatient prescription drugs, reinstitution of the policy for Medicare Part D enrollees shall be without coverage for outpatient prescription drugs and shall otherwise provide substantially equivalent coverage to the coverage in effect before the date of suspension; and\n(c) shall provide for classification of premiums on terms at least as favorable to the policyholder or certificateholder as the premium classification terms that would have applied to the policyholder of certificateholder had the coverage not been suspended. (8)\n\nTermination of a Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall be without prejudice to any continuous loss which commenced while the policy or certificate was in force, but the extension of benefits beyond the period during which the policy or certificate was in force may be predicated upon the continuous total disability of the insured, limited to the duration of the policy benefit period, if any, or payment of the maximum benefits. If no specific benefit period is provided, an extended benefit period of at least 12 months must be included in the policy or certificate. A loss shall commence when a medical service, whether or not covered by the policy or certificate, is rendered for the condition causing total disability. Receipt of Medicare Part D benefits will not be considered in determining a continuous loss. (d) Applications for Medicare supplement insurance. In addition to the requirements set forth in section\n52.51\nof this Title, the following provisions shall apply to applications for Medicare supplement insurance: (1)\n\nApplications may not contain any questions dealing with the health or health history of the applicant and no physical examination may be requested. (2)\n\nApplications for Medicare supplement insurance shall include a conspicuous bold face notice advising the applicant that the sale of a Medicare supplement policy is prohibited where an individual has a Medicare supplement policy in force and does not desire to replace the existing policy or where the Medicare supplement policy would duplicate benefits to which the individual is entitled under a Medicare advantage plan. (3)\n\nAll applications for Medicare supplement insurance shall include the right to apply for standardized Medicare supplement benefit plans \"A\" and \"B\" and either \"D\" or \"G\" as well as any of the other Medicare supplement insurance benefit plans permitted by this section.

(4)\n\nIn recommending the purchase or replacement of any Medicare supplement policy or certificate, an agent shall make reasonable efforts to determine the appropriateness of a recommended purchase or replacement. The application for Medicare supplement insurance taken by an agent shall include, or have attached thereto, a statement signed by the agent as follows: \"I have reviewed the current health insurance coverage of the applicant and find that additional coverage of the type and amount applied for is appropriate for the applicant's needs.''\n(5)\n\nAny sale of a Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate that will provide an individual with more than one Medicare supplement policy or certificate or duplicate benefits to which an individual is entitled under a Medicare advantage plan is prohibited. (6)\n\nApplication forms shall include the following questions and statements designed to elicit information as to whether, as of the date of the application, the applicant for a policy or certificate has currently Medicare supplement, Medicare advantage, Medicaid coverage, or another accident and health insurance policy or certificate in force and whether the Medicare supplement policy or certificate being applied for is intended to replace such existing coverage. A supplementary application or other form to be signed by the applicant containing such questions and statements may be used. Where the application is taken by an agent, such application or supplementary application form shall also be signed by the agent. (i) Statements.

You must request this suspension within 90 days of becoming eligible for Medicaid. If you are no longer entitled to Medicaid, your suspended Medicare supplement policy (certificate) (or, if that is no longer available, a substantially equivalent policy) will be reinstituted if requested within 90 days of losing Medicaid eligibility. If the Medicare supplement policy provided coverage for outpatient prescription drugs and you enrolled in Medicare Part D while your policy was suspended, the reinstituted policy will not have outpatient prescription drug coverage, but will otherwise be substantially equivalent to your coverage before the date of the suspension. (e) If you are eligible for, and have enrolled in a Medicare supplement policy by reason of disability and you later become covered by an employer or union-based group health plan, the benefits and premiums under your Medicare supplement policy can be suspended, if requested, while you are covered under the employer or union-based group health plan. If you suspend your Medicare supplement policy under these circumstances, and later lose your employer or union-based group health plan, your suspended Medicare supplement policy (or, if that is no longer available, a substantially equivalent policy) will be reinstituted if requested within 90 days of losing your employer or union-based group health plan. If the Medicare supplement policy provided coverage for outpatient prescription drugs and you enrolled in Medicare Part D while your policy was suspended, the reinstituted policy will not have outpatient prescription drug coverage, but will otherwise be substantially equivalent to your coverage before the date of the suspension.

(e) Rules relating to the replacement of health coverage with Medicare supplement insurance coverage. (1)\n\nUpon determining that a sale of a Medicare supplement insurance or Medicare select policy or certificate will involve replacement of accident and health insurance (including Medicare supplement insurance, Medicare select or Medicare advantage coverage), health maintenance organization coverage or any employer-provided health benefit arrangement, an issuer, other than a direct response issuer, or its agent, shall furnish the applicant, prior to issuance or delivery of the Medicare supplement or Medicare select policy or certificate, a notice regarding replacement of coverage. One copy of such notice signed by the applicant and the agent, except where the coverage is sold without an agent, shall be provided to the applicant and an additional signed copy shall be retained by the issuer. A direct response issuer shall deliver to the applicant at the time of the issuance of the policy the notice regarding replacement of coverage. (2)\n\nThe notice required by paragraph (1) of this subdivision for an issuer shall be provided in substantially the following form in no less than 12-point type: NOTICE TO APPLICANT REGARDING REPLACEMENT\nOF ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE, HMO COVERAGE OR\nEMPLOYER-PROVIDED HEALTH BENEFIT ARRANGEMENT\n(Insurance Company's Name and Address)\nSAVE THIS NOTICE! IT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU IN THE FUTURE. According to (your application) (information you have furnished), you intend to terminate existing accident and health insurance, health maintenance organization coverage or employer-provided health benefit coverage and replace it with a policy (certificate) to be issued by (Company Name) Insurance Company. Your new policy (certificate) will provide thirty (30) days within which you may decide without cost whether you desire to keep the policy (certificate). You should review this new coverage carefully. Compare it with all health coverage you now have and evaluate the need for existing coverage that may duplicate this policy (certificate). Terminate your present coverage only if, after due consideration, you find that purchase of this Medicare supplement coverage is a wise decision. STATEMENT TO APPLICANT BY ISSUER, AGENT (BROKER OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE): I have reviewed your current medical or health insurance coverage. The replacement of insurance involved in this transaction (does) (does not) duplicate coverage, to the best of my knowledge. The replacement policy is being purchased for the following reason(s) checked below: _____ Additional benefits. _____ No change in benefits, but lower premiums. _____ Fewer benefits and lower premiums. _____ My plan has outpatient prescription drug coverage and I am enrolling in Part D. _____ Disenrollment from a Medicare Advantage plan. Please explain reason for disenrollment. ____________\n____________\n_____ Other. (please specify) ____________\n____________\n____________\n1. Health conditions which you may presently have may be considered preexisting conditions and may not be immediately or fully covered under the new policy (certificate). This could result in denial or delay of a claim for benefits under the new policy (certificate), whereas a similar claim might have been payable under your present coverage. (This paragraph may be deleted if the replacement does not involve application of a new preexisting condition limitation.)\n2. State regulation provides that in applying a preexisting condition limitation, a Medicare supplement issuer must credit the time the applicant was previously covered under creditable coverage (including Medicare supplement insurance, Medicare select coverage and Medicare Advantage plans) if the previous creditable coverage was continuous to a date not more than 63 days prior to the enrollment date of the new policy or certificate. (This paragraph may be deleted if the replacement does not involve application of a new preexisting condition limitation.)\n3. If you still wish to terminate your present policy or certificate and replace it with new coverage, review the application carefully before you sign it to be certain that all information has been properly recorded. Do not cancel your present coverage until you have received your new policy (certificate) and are sure that you want to keep it. ____________\nSignature of Agent, Broker or other Representative\n(Signature not required for direct response sales.)\n(Insert typed name and address of issuer, agent or broker)\n____________\n(Applicant's Signature)\n____________\n(Date)\n(3)\n\nIf a Medicare supplement or Medicare select policy or certificate replaces another Medicare supplement policy or certificate, a Medicare select policy or certificate, a Medicare advantage plan or a policy or certificate issued pursuant to a contract under section 1876 of the Federal Social Security Act, then the replacing issuer must provide the policyholder or certificateholder with the following written notice: \"Your application for the Medicare supplement insurance policy (certificate) issued by this company indicates that you intended to terminate existing Medicare supplement insurance coverage, Medicare select coverage, Medicare Advantage plan or health maintenance organization (HMO) issued Medicare cost contract and replace it with the coverage applied for with this company. Duplicate coverage is unnecessary and you should terminate one of your existing coverages if more than one such plan is still in force.''\nAt the option of the issuer, such notice shall either be included with the first premium due notice mailed to the policyholder or certificateholder after the replacement coverage is issued, or sent separately within 30 days of the date of the first premium due notice, but in no event shall such notice be provided later than six months after issuance of the replacement policy or certificate. (f) Permitted compensation arrangements. (1)\n\nAn issuer may provide commission or other compensation to an agent or other representative for the sale of a Medicare supplement policy or certificate only if the first year commission or other first year compensation is no more than 200 percent of the commission or other compensation paid for selling or servicing the policy or certificate in the second year or period. (2)\n\nThe commission or other compensation provided in subsequent (renewal) years must be the same as that provided in the second year or period and must be provided for no fewer than five renewal years. (3)\n\nNo issuer shall provide compensation to its agents or other producers and no agent or producer shall receive compensation greater than the renewal compensation payable by the replacing issuer on renewal policies or certificates if an existing Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate, Medicare select policy or certificate, Medicare advantage plan or a policy or certificate issued pursuant to a contract under section 1876 of the Federal Social Security Act is replaced by a Medicare supplement insurance or Medicare select policy or certificate. (4)\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, \"compensation'' includes pecuniary or non-pecuniary remuneration of any kind relating to the sale or renewal of the policy or certificate including but not limited to bonuses, gifts, prizes, awards and finder's fees. (g) Standards for marketing. (1)\n\nAn issuer, directly or through its agents or other producers, shall: (i) Establish marketing procedures to assure that any comparison of policies by its agents or other producers will be fair and accurate. (ii)\n\nEstablish marketing procedures to assure excessive insurance is not sold or issued. (iii)\n\nDisplay prominently by type, stamp or other appropriate means, on the first page of the policy the following: \"Notice to buyer: This policy may not cover all of your medical expenses.''\n(iv)\n\nInquire and otherwise make every reasonable effort to identify whether a prospective applicant or enrollee for Medicare supplement insurance already has accident and health insurance and the types and amount of any such insurance. (v) Establish auditable procedures for verifying compliance with this subdivision. (2)\n\nIn addition to the practices prohibited in article 24 of the Insurance Law, the following acts and practices are prohibited. (i) Twisting.
