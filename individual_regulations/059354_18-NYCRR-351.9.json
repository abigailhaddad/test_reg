Aid to dependent children may be\nconsidered concurrent benefits when provided to meet the needs of home relief\nrecipients; medical assistance based upon eligibility for home relief may be\nconsidered concurrent benefits when provided to meet the needs of recipients of\nfederally funded aid to dependent children. (3)\n\nIndividual includes a public assistance\nrecipient or a recipient of benefits from any other programs or activities for\nwhich the department is responsible, any legally responsible relative of such\nrecipient and any other adult payee for such recipient. (b) No individual may receive concurrent\nbenefits unless a social services official, in accordance with the policies or\ndirections of the department, specifically has determined that such duplication\nof benefits is necessary and appropriate due to specific case circumstances\nwhich are stated in the case record. (c) If a social services official learns that\nan individual is applying improperly for or receiving benefits when such\nindividual is also receiving, or has been approved to receive, concurrent\nbenefits in that social services district, or in another social services\ndistrict, state, territory or commonwealth, then the social services official\nmust deny the benefits for which the individual, legally responsible relative\nor payee is applying, or must discontinue any concurrent benefits being\nprovided for such individual. (d) A\ndetermination that an individual is receiving or applying for concurrent\nbenefits must be based on information which establishes with reasonable\ncertainty that the same individual is receiving or applying for assistance to\nmeet the same needs in the same or separate subdivisions of that social\nservices district, or in another social services district, state, territory or\ncommonwealth.
