(16)\n\nSerious health\ncondition\nmeans an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental\ncondition that involves: inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential\nhealth care facility; or continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a\nhealth care provider. Serious health condition\nalso means a\nCOVID-19 diagnosis by a health care provider. (i) As used in this Title, continuing\ntreatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider\nmeans\none or more of the following: (a) a period of\nmore than three consecutive, full days during which a family member is unable\nto work, attend school, perform regular daily activities, or is otherwise\nincapacitated due to illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental\nconditions, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to\nthe same condition, that also involves: (1)\ntreatment two or more times by a health care provider; or\n(2)\ntreatment on at least one occasion by a\nhealth care provider, which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under\nthe supervision of the health care provider; (b) any period during which a family member\nis unable to work, attend school, perform regular daily activities, or is\notherwise incapacitated due to a chronic serious health condition. A chronic\nserious health condition is one which: (1)\nrequires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider; (2)\ncontinues over an extended period of time\n(including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n(3)\nmay cause episodic rather than a\ncontinuing period of incapacity. Examples of such episodic incapacity include\nbut are not limited to asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy; (c) a long-term or permanent period during\nwhich a family member is unable to work, attend school, perform regular daily\nactivities, or is otherwise incapacitated due to an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition for which treatment may not be\neffective. The family member must be under the continuing supervision of, but\nneed not be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider. Examples\ninclude, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or the terminal\nstages of a disease; (d) a period\nduring which a family member is unable to work, attend school, perform regular\ndaily activities, or is otherwise incapacitated because he or she is receiving\ntreatment (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care\nprovider for: (1)\nrestorative surgery after\nan accident or other injury; or\n(2)\na condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than\nthree consecutive full days in the absence of medical intervention or\ntreatment. Examples include, but are not limited to, cancer\n(\ne.g., chemotherapy and radiation), severe arthritis (physical\ntherapy), or kidney disease (dialysis). (ii)\n\nAs used in this Title, the term\ntreatment\nincludes, but is not limited to, examinations to\ndetermine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the\ncondition. Treatment does not include routine examinations. Examples of a\nregimen of continuing treatment includes, but is not limited to, a course of\nprescription medication (\ne.g., an antibiotic) or therapy\nrequiring special equipment to resolve or alleviate the health condition\n(\ne.g., oxygen). A regimen of continuing treatment that\nincludes the taking of over-the-counter medications (\ne.g., aspirin, antihistamines, or salves), bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and\nother similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health care\nprovider, is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute a regimen of continuing\ntreatment for purposes of leave under this Title. (iii)\n\nConditions for which cosmetic\ntreatments are administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic\nsurgery) are not serious health conditions unless inpatient hospital care is\nrequired or unless complications develop. Ordinarily, unless complications\narise, the common cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of conditions that do not meet the\ndefinition of a serious health condition and do not qualify for leave under\nthis Title. Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or removal of\ncancerous growths are serious health conditions, provided all the other\nconditions of this paragraph are met. Mental illness or allergies may be\nserious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of this paragraph are\nmet. (17)\n\nTermination of employment\nmeans the last day that the employee\nperforms work in the service of a covered employer. (18)\n\nThird party\nadministrator\nmeans an individual or entity licensed to represent\nself-insured employers or insurance carriers pursuant to subdivisions (3-b) and\n(3-d) of Workers' Compensation Law section 50. (19)\n\nWages\nmeans the money\nrate at which employment with a covered employer is recompensed by the employer\nas more fully set forth in section\n357.1\nof this Title. For the\npurposes of paid family leave, the computation shall include the reasonable\nvalue of board, rent, housing, lodging or similar advantage received where such\nare withheld by the employer during the period of family leave and shall not\ninclude the cash value of benefits, the receipt of which by an employee is not\nsubject to the New York State personal income tax. Wages for an individual\nbusiness owner, as that term is defined in paragraph (11) of this subdivision, shall be earnings subject to Federal self-employment tax. (b) The definitions included in this section\nmay be used in this Title when context so requires. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
