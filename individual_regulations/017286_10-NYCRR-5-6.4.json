  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 5-6.4 - Sources of water\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll sources of water must be approved before use. (a) The sources of all bulk or bottled drinking water located in New York State must be approved by the State. Sources of all bulk or bottled drinking water located outside New York State must be approved by the agency having jurisdiction. (b) Sources shall, at a minimum, meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nAll sources shall be developed in conformity with up-to-date sanitary engineering practices as set forth in Rural Water Supply and Recommended Standards for Water Works. (2)\n\nAll sources shall be located, developed and protected so they are not subject to natural or artificial contamination. (c) All spring sources shall, at a minimum, meet the following requirements: (1)\nA watertight wall shall completely surround the spring, not less than 12 inches above the highest point of ground and extend down through the overburden to the water-bearing stratum. On rock, such walls shall be keyed and sealed with cement grout to the rock. The top of the wall shall be level to accommodate a cover. (2)\nA tight-fitting, locked cover shall be installed on the top of the encircling wall. The cover shall be constructed so as to provide reliable protection against contamination by animals or humans. (3)\n\nWhere the spring is protected by a spring house, the building shall be vermin-proof and shall be kept locked. (4)\nA ditch or berm shall be constructed and routinely maintained to divert surface drainage away from the spring. (5)\n\nSpring water shall be collected only at the natural orifice of the spring or through a bore hole that is adjacent to the natural orifice. Spring water collected with the assistance of external force or through a bore hole, or through a spring head that is otherwise altered to protect the water source shall retain all the physical properties of and be of the same composition and quality as the water that flows naturally to the surface of the earth. (d) All drilled wells shall, at a minimum, meet the following requirements: (1)\nA watertight casing shall be installed to the depth necessary to prevent surface contamination and to seal contamination of undesirable strata. The casing shall be sealed by filling the annular opening between the casing and the earth with cement or cement-sand grout or other approved sealant, at least 1 1/2 inches thick. This seal shall extend from ground surface to a point not less than six inches below ground water level. (2)\nA permanent casing shall be installed to at least 12 inches above the pump house floor or concrete apron surface and at least 18 inches above final ground surface. (3)\n\nWells shall be located on sites not subjected to flooding or be provided with an earth berm surrounding the casing and terminating at an elevation at least two feet above the highest known flood elevation or have other suitable protection as determined by the State. (4)\n\nWells shall be equipped with an approved pitless adaptor unit installed at the joint where the discharge pipe passes through the well casing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
