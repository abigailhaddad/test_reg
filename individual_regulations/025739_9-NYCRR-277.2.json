(d) Comparable replacement dwelling means a\ndwelling which is: (1)\ndecent, safe and\nsanitary as described in subdivision (f) of this section; (2)\nfunctionally equivalent to the\ndisplacement dwelling. The term functionally equivalent means that it performs\nthe same function, provides the same utility, and is capable of contributing to\na comparable style of living. While a comparable replacement dwelling need not\npossess every feature of the displacement dwelling, the principal features must\nbe present. Generally, functional equivalency is an objective standard, reflecting the range of purposes for which the various physical features of a\ndwelling may be used. However, in determining whether a replacement dwelling is\nfunctionally equivalent to the displacement dwelling, the agency may consider\nreasonable trade-offs for specific features when the replacement unit is \"equal\nto or better than\" the displacement dwelling; (3)\nadequate in size to accommodate the\noccupants; (4)\nin an area not\nsubject to unreasonably adverse environmental conditions; (5)\nin a location generally not less\ndesirable than the location of the displaced person's dwelling with respect to\npublic utilities and commercial and public facilities, and reasonably\naccessible to the person's place of employment; (6)\non a site that is typical in size for\nresidential development with normal site improvements, including customary\nlandscaping. The site need not include special improvements such as\noutbuildings, swimming pools, or greenhouses. See also\n277.5(c)(1)(ii); (7)\ncurrently\navailable to the displaced person on the private market. However, a comparable\nreplacement dwelling for a person receiving government housing assistance\nbefore displacement may reflect similar government housing assistance; and\n(8)\nwithin the financial means\nof the displaced person; (i) a replacement\ndwelling purchased by a homeowner in occupancy for at least 180 days prior to\ninitiation of negotiations (180-day homeowner) is considered to be within the\nhomeowner's financial means if the homeowner is paid the full price\ndifferential as described in 277.5(a)(3), all increased mortgage interest costs\nas described at 277.5(a)(4) and all incidental expenses as described at\n277.5(a)(5), plus any additional amount required to be paid under 277.5(d), replacement housing of last resort; (ii)\na replacement dwelling rented by a\ndisplaced person is considered to be within a person's financial means if, after receiving rental assistance under this Part, the person's monthly rent\nand estimated average monthly utility costs for the replacement dwelling do not\nexceed the person's base monthly rental for the displacement dwelling as\ndescribed at 277.5(b)(2)(ii); (iii)\nfor a displaced person who is not eligible to receive a replacement housing\npayment because of the person's failure to meet length-of-occupancy\nrequirements, comparable replacement rental housing is considered to be within\nthe person's financial means if the State pays that portion of the monthly\nhousing costs of a replacement dwelling which exceeds 30 percent of such\nperson's gross monthly household income. Such rental assistance must be paid\nunder last resort housing provisions in 277.5(d) of this Part for a period of\n42 months; and\n(9)\nfair\nhousing, open to all persons regardless of race, color, religion, sex or\nnational origin.

If the application of the above criteria creates an\ninequity or hardship in any given case, the agency may approve the use of other\ncriteria as determined appropriate. (f) Decent, safe and sanitary dwelling means\na dwelling which meets applicable housing and occupancy codes. However, any of\nthe following standards which are not met by an applicable code shall apply\nunless waived for good cause by the agency. The dwelling shall: (1)\nbe structurally sound, weather-tight, and\nin good repair; (2)\ncontain a safe\nelectrical wiring system adequate for lighting and other devices; (3)\ncontain a heating system capable of\nsustaining a healthful temperature (of approximately 70 degrees) for a\ndisplaced person, except in those areas where local climatic conditions do not\nrequire such a system; (4)\nbe\nadequate in size with respect to the number of rooms and area of living space\nneeded to accommodate the displaced person. There shall be a separate, well\nlighted and ventilated bathroom that provides privacy to the user and contains\na sink, bathtub or shower stall, and a toilet, all in good working order and\nproperly connected to appropriate sources of water and to a sewage drainage\nsystem.
