  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1200.3.6 - Trial publicity\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A lawyer who is participating in or\nhas participated in a criminal or civil matter shall not make an extrajudicial\nstatement that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know will be disseminated\nby means of public communication and will have a substantial likelihood of\nmaterially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter. (b) A statement ordinarily is\nlikely to prejudice materially an adjudicative proceeding when it refers to a\ncivil matter triable to a jury, a criminal matter or any other proceeding that\ncould result in incarceration, and the statement relates to: (1)\nthe character, credibility, reputation or criminal record of a party, suspect in a criminal\ninvestigation or witness, or the identity of a witness or the expected\ntestimony of a party or witness; (2)\nin a criminal matter that could\nresult in incarceration, the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense or\nthe existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by a\ndefendant or suspect, or that person's refusal or failure to make a\nstatement; (3)\nthe\nperformance or results of any examination or test, or the refusal or failure of\na person to submit to an examination or test, or the identity or nature of\nphysical evidence expected to be presented; (4)\nany opinion as to the guilt or\ninnocence of a defendant or suspect in a criminal matter that could result in\nincarceration; (5)\ninformation the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is likely to be\ninadmissible as evidence in a trial and would, if disclosed, create a\nsubstantial risk of prejudicing an impartial trial; or\n(6)\nthe fact that a defendant\nhas been charged with a crime, unless there is included therein a statement\nexplaining that the charge is merely an accusation and that the defendant is\npresumed innocent until and unless proven guilty. (c) Provided that the\nstatement complies with paragraph (a), a lawyer may state the following without\nelaboration: (1)\nthe claim, offense or defense and, except when prohibited by law, the identity of the\npersons involved; (2)\ninformation contained in a public\nrecord; (3)\nthat an\ninvestigation of a matter is in progress; (4)\nthe scheduling or result of any\nstep in litigation; (5)\na request for assistance in\nobtaining evidence and information necessary thereto; (6)\na warning of danger\nconcerning the behavior of a person involved, when there is reason to believe\nthat there exists the likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or to the\npublic interest; and\n(7)\nin a criminal matter: (i) the identity, age, residence, occupation and family status of the accused; (ii)\nif the accused has not\nbeen apprehended, information necessary to aid in apprehension of that\nperson; (iii)\nthe\nidentity of investigating and arresting officers or agencies and the length of\nthe investigation; and\n(iv)\nthe fact, time and place of\narrest, resistance, pursuit and use of weapons, and a description of physical\nevidence seized, other than as contained only in a confession, admission or\nstatement. (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a\nlawyer may make a statement that a reasonable lawyer would believe is required\nto protect a client from the substantial prejudicial effect of recent publicity\nnot initiated by the lawyer or the lawyer's client. A statement made pursuant\nto this paragraph shall be limited to such information as is necessary to\nmitigate the recent adverse publicity. (e) No lawyer associated in a firm or\ngovernment agency with a lawyer subject to paragraph (a) shall make a statement\nprohibited by paragraph (a). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
