  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 943.1 - Purpose and Effect of Regulations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\npurpose of these regulations is to provide those regulated by the Joint\n\nCommission on Public Ethics (\"Commission\"), as well as the public, a\nconsolidated resource for understanding and complying with the requirements of\n\nArticle 1-A of the Legislative Law (the \"Lobbying Act\"), as authorized by\nsection\n94\nof the\n\nExecutive Law and the Lobbying Act. These regulations also serve to codify the\nconstitutional authority to regulate grassroots lobbying that was recognized in\n\nUnited States v. Harriss ( 347 U.S. 612\n) in 1954, and exercised by the\n\nCommission's predecessor agencies in accordance with the 1982 decision in New\n\nYork State Temporary Commission on Lobbying v. CICU (534 F. Supp. 489). (b) These regulations\nconsider, reflect and, in part, are based upon and in many instances codify\nthis Commission's and its predecessors' earlier advisory opinions, guidelines, instructions, and practices. They also set forth the Commission's positions on\nissues not previously addressed by those authorities. Thus, individuals and\nentities subject to the Lobbying Act should consider any earlier precedents as\nsuperseded by these regulations in the event any such prior guidelines, opinions, instructions or practices are inconsistent with this Part.
