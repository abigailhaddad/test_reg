  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 229.22 - Records\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe average specific gravity of the distributed gas\ntested at each of its testing stations required herein by section\n229.50\n(a)-(d)\nof\nthis Part, as determined by the tests required herein by section\n229.21\nof this Part, shall be\ncomputed and recorded for each day and each calendar month by each company. In\neach instance of a testing station where a recording gravitometer is maintained\nand operated, a continuous record of the specific gravity of the distributed\ngas, as determined by said recording gravitometer, shall be maintained and the\ncorrected average specific gravity of the distributed gas be computed and\nrecorded for each day and each calendar month from said continuous record\nexcept that for each day that the corrected maximum specific gravity exceeds\nthe corrected minimum specific gravity by two or more per cent of the latter, the corrected average, maximum and minimum specific gravity of the distributed\ngas be computed and recorded from said continuous record. A copy of each\nspecific gravity record shall be maintained at its originating testing\nstation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n229.22\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
