(t) \"Grower\" means a\nperson who is licensed by the Department to grow or cultivate hemp in the\n\nState. (u) \"Grow Location\" means a\ncontiguous land area or the greenhouses, hoop houses, or buildings for indoor\ncultivation, registered with the Department, on or in which a licensee or\napplicant will conduct licensed hemp cultivation activities. Each\nnon-contiguous grow location must be registered separately. (v) \"Handle\" means to harvest, dry, or store\nhemp plants or hemp plant parts prior to their introduction into commerce. Handling includes the processing of hemp only in connection with its growing\nand cultivation, the disposal of cannabis plants that fall outside the\ndefinition of hemp, and the remediation of hemp as permitted pursuant to this\n\nPart. (w) \"Hemp\" means the plant\nspecies Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds\nthereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and\nsalts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol\nconcentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. (x) \"Liquid chromatography\" or \"LC\" means a\ntype of chromatography technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. LC relies on pumps to pass\na pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column\nfilled with a solid adsorbent material to separate and analyze\ncompounds. (y) \"Key participants\"\nmeans a sole proprietor, a partner in partnership, or a person with executive\nmanagerial control in a business or educational entity. A person with executive\nmanagerial control includes, without limitation, persons such as a chief\nexecutive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. This\ndefinition does not include non-executive managers such as farm, field, or\nshift managers. (z) \"Law\nenforcement agency\" means any Federal, State, or local law enforcement\nagency. (aa)\n\"Lot\" means a\ncontiguous area in a field, sub-field, tract, greenhouse, or indoor growing\nstructure containing the same variety or strain of hemp throughout the\narea. (bb)\n\"Marijuana\" means all\nparts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds\nthereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds\nor resin. The term marijuana does not include hemp, as defined in this Part, and does not include the mature stalks of Cannabis sativa L., fiber produced\nfrom its stalks, oil or cake made from its seeds and any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks\n(except the resin extracted therefrom), its fiber, oil, cake, or sterilized\nseed incapable of germination. Except as otherwise provided by this Part, marijuana means all cannabis that tests as having a total THC concentration\nlevel of higher than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. (cc)\n\"Measurement of Uncertainty (MU)\" means\nthe parameter, associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes\nthe dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the\nquantity subject to measurement. (dd)\n\"Negligence\" means the failure to\nexercise the level of care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in\ncomplying with the provisions of this Part. (ee)\n\"Percentage of THC on a dry weight\nbasis\" means the percentage of THC, by weight, in a hemp plant, the segregated\nparts of a hemp plant or the comingled parts of harvested hemp plants, after\nexcluding moisture from the plant matter. (ff)\n\"Performance-based sampling\" means a\nsampling approach that sets a performance objective of collecting enough\nsamples to ensure, at a confidence level of 95 percent, that no more than one\npercent of the plants in the lot exceed the acceptable hemp THC level. Performance-based sampling provides flexibility in the sampling approach to the\nextent that the approach provides an effective method of ensuring the overall\nacceptable hemp THC level. Performance-based sampling may be based on, among\nother things, the end-use categories of the plant varieties, such as fiber or\ngrain, historical THC concentrations of varietals over time, or the\ncharacteristics and growing histories of certain farms or producers, certified\nseed, or clonal varieties, some or all of which may ensure effective criteria\nto ensure overall acceptable hemp THC levels and require less comprehensive\nsampling of hemp. (gg)\n\"Person\"\nmeans an individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, or any business entity or institution of higher education, by\nwhatever name designated and however formed or organized. (hh)\n\"Post-decarboxylation\" means, in the\ncontext of testing methodologies for THC concentration levels in hemp, a value\ndetermined after the process of decarboxylation that determines the total\npotential delta-9 THC content derived from the sum of the THC and THCA content, and reported on a dry weight basis. The post-decarboxylation value of THC may\nbe calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, gas\nchromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its\nneutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a\ngiven sample. The post-decarboxylation value of THC can also be calculated by\nusing a liquid chromatography technique, which keeps the THCA intact, and\nrequires a conversion calculation of that THCA to calculate total potential THC\nin a given sample. (ii)\n\"Processing\nof hemp in connection with its growing and cultivation\" means the growing, cultivation, harvesting, drying, curing, grinding, and trimming of hemp plants. Processing of hemp includes the remediation of hemp in conformity with the\nrequirements of this Part. (jj)\n\"Produce\" or \"Production\" means to grow hemp plants for market, or for\ncultivation for market in the State or the United States. (kk)\n\"Remediation\" means the process of\nrendering non-compliant hemp being cultivated by a licensed hemp grower to\ncompliant hemp as set forth in this Part. For example, remediation can be\nachieved by separating and destroying non-compliant flowers while retaining\nstalks, leaves and seeds; or by shredding the entire hemp plant to create a\nhomogeneous \"biomass\". Remediated hemp must be retested for THC\ncompliance. (ll)\n\"Registered\npremises\" means any facility, location, or property leased, licensed, owned, or\notherwise used by a person to grow hemp that has been authorized by the\n\nDepartment as a site where hemp may be grown. (mm)\n\"Sampling\" means the process of\ncollecting cuttings from hemp plants for the purposes of compliance\ntesting. (nn)\n\"Sampling Agent\"\nmeans a person trained and certified by the Department on applicable State and\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) procedures to collect regulatory\nsample of hemp for THC compliance testing. (oo)\n\"State\" means the State of New\n\nYork. (pp)\n\"Total THC\" means the\nvalue determined after the process of decarboxylation, or the application of a\nconversion factor, as set forth in this Part, if the testing does not include\ndecarboxylation that expresses the potential total delta-9 THC content derived\nfrom the sum of the THC and THCA content and reported on a dry weight\nbasis. (qq)\n\"Valid license\" means a\nduly issued license that is unexpired, unsuspended, and unrevoked. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
