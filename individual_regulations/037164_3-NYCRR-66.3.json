Tit. 3 § 66.3 - Acquisitions of new york insured institutions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Subject to the provisions of this Part, an out-of-state savings and loan holding company or subsidiary thereof may\nacquire control, directly or indirectly, of one or more insured institutions; provided, however, that no such acquisition of control shall be lawful without\nthe prior approval of the superintendent. Any such acquisition of control\napproved by the superintendent shall not affect the powers or privileges of\nsuch insured institution or insured institutions. Any out-of-state savings and\nloan holding company or subsidiary thereof desiring to acquire control of one\nor more insured institutions shall file an application in writing with the\nsuperintendent and pay the fee specified in section\n1.2\nof Supervisory Policy G 1 of\nthis Title. The application shall contain such information as the\nsuperintendent may deem necessary or appropriate for the purpose of making a\ndetermination under this Part. As used in this Part, the term control means the\npossession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the\ndirection of the management and policies of an insured institution, whether\nthrough the ownership of voting stock of such insured institution, the\nownership of voting stock of any company which possesses such power, or\notherwise. Control shall be presumed to exist if any out-of-state savings and\nloan holding company or subsidiary thereof, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds with power to vote five per centum or more of the voting\nstock of such insured institution, but no person shall be deemed to control an\ninsured institution solely by reason of being an officer or director of such\ninstitution or savings and loan holding company or subsidiary. The\nsuperintendent may in his or her discretion, upon the application of an\nout-of-state savings and loan holding company or subsidiary which, directly or\nindirectly, owns, controls or holds with power to vote or seeks to own, control\nor hold with power to vote, any voting stock of such insured institution, determine whether or not the ownership, control or holding of such voting stock\nwould constitute control of such institution for purposes of this Part. No\nproposed acquisition of control pursuant to this Part shall be approved unless\nthe superintendent finds that: (1)\nthe statute\nlaws of the jurisdiction in which the operations of the out-of-state savings\nand loan holding company's insured subsidiaries are principally conducted\nspecifically authorize the direct or indirect acquisition of control of one or\nmore insured institutions in such jurisdiction by a savings and loan holding\ncompany or subsidiary thereof, the operations of which savings and loan holding\ncompany's insured subsidiaries are principally conducted in this State; or\n(2)\nsuch statute laws authorize\nthe acquisition of control because the out-of-state savings and loan holding\ncompany or subsidiary is authorized by Banking Law, section 413 and this Part\nto acquire control of and hold shares of insured institutions in this\n\nState. (b) The direct or\nindirect acquisition of control by a savings and loan holding company or\nsubsidiary thereof, under such statute laws, shall not affect the powers or\nprivileges of the insured institution over which control is obtained, nor shall\nany such acquisition be subject to conditions or restrictions materially\nlimiting the ability of a savings and loan holding company or subsidiary\nthereof to acquire insured institutions generally in such jurisdiction if such\nconditions or restrictions would not apply with equal effect to the acquisition\nof insured institutions in such jurisdiction by an out-of-state savings and\nloan holding company, or subsidiary thereof, which out-of- state savings and\nloan holding company or subsidiary conducts it principal banking business in\nsuch jurisdiction. (c) Any\nout-of-state savings and loan holding company or subsidiary which proposes to\nacquire control of one or more insured institutions pursuant to the provisions\nof this article shall provide to the superintendent a copy of any original\napplication to the applicable Federal regulatory agency for approval of such\naction, and a copy of any supplemental material or subsequent amendments\nthereto, at the same time the application, supplemental material or amendment\nis transmitted to such agency. (d) An insured institution acquired pursuant to this subdivision may be either a\nnewly organized institution, which at the time of acquisition has not commenced\nany part of its banking business, or an institution currently conducting\nbanking business in this State. (e) Any out-of-state savings and loan holding company or subsidiary which acquires\ncontrol of an insured institution pursuant to the provisions of this Part shall\nfile with the superintendent copies of all regular and periodic reports which\nsuch out-of-state savings and loan holding company is required to file under\nsection 13 or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, excluding any portions not available to the public.
