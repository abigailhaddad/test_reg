(1)\n\nWhen billing\nfor PTA services, supervising authorized PTs must select codes from the\n\nPhysical Medicine Section of the Official New York State Workers' Compensation\n\nMedical Fee Schedule that are permissible and within the scope of practice for\nPTAs using modifier CQ. (2)\n\nWhen\nbilling for OTA services, supervising authorized OTs must select codes from the\n\nPhysical Medicine Section of the Official New York State Workers' Compensation\n\nMedical Fee Schedule that are permissible and within the scope of practice of\nOTAs using modifier CO. (3)\n\nServices\nbilled using the modifiers CQ or CO must be billed and paid at 85 percent of\nthe amount payable for such services had they been performed directly by PTs\nand OTs. Clinical notes by PTAs must be cosigned by the supervising PT. Clinical notes by OTAs must be cosigned by the supervising OT. PTAs and OTAs\nmay not provide services or bill for services independently. (4)\n\nNothing in this section shall change the\nmaximum numbers of billable Relative Value Units (RVUs) for physical therapy\nand occupational therapy on any given date of service, as outlined elsewhere in\nthe fee schedule. They are not increased or otherwise changed based on whether\nthe services are provided by PTs, OTs, PTAs or OTAs. (5)\n\nWhen services are performed by PTs and\nPTAs (or OTs and OTAs) on the same date of service, the services applied to the\nmaximum number of RVUs on any given date of service shall be determined giving\npriority to services provided by PTs over those provided by PTAs, and services\nprovided by OTs over those provided by OTAs. (6)\n\nThe ability of PTAs and OTAs to provide\nservices under NYS Workers Compensation, and for supervising PTs and OTs to\nsubmit bills for said services, shall in no way expand or otherwise change the\nscope of practice or permissible activities for PTAs or OTAs by statute, and/or\nany applicable regulations promulgated by the New York State Education\n\nDepartment, New York State Department of Health, or the New York State Workers'\nCompensation Board. As such, it shall be impermissible for PTAs/OTAs to perform\nany services or activities otherwise reserved for PTs and OTs respectively, or\nfor supervising PTs or OTs to bill for such services, and Current Procedural\n\nTerminology (CPT) codes must be selected accordingly. (i) Examples may include, but are not limited\nto: a PTA is prohibited by section 6738(a) of the NYS Education Law from\nperforming evaluation, testing, interpretation, planning or modification of\npatient/client programs; a PT conducts the initial evaluation and develops the\nplan of care, and the treatment may be provided by the PTA; PTAs and OTAs may\nnot perform Functional Capacity Evaluations\n(FCEs).

(2)\nCPT code 87635 may only be billed when\nthere is a claim for workers' compensation due to a COVID-19 infection as a\nresult of a workplace exposure or when testing for COVID-19 is administered as\npart of a required pre-operative testing protocol in accordance with Department\nof Health guidance. (3)\nCPT code\n87635 may not be billed for routine screening of workers' compensation\nclaimants for the presence of the COVID-19 virus. (4)\n\nAntibody testing is not available under\nthe Official New York Workers' Compensation Fee Schedule. (5)\nCPT code 87635 may only be billed in one\ninstance.
