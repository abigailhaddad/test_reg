If the information is not submitted, the IDRE shall\nmake a second request and provide one business day to submit the information. If the information is not submitted, or if the application is not eligible, the\nIDRE shall promptly reject the application. (c) Within three business days of a\ndetermination that the health care plan's, physician's, hospital's or\nnonparticipating referred health care provider's application is eligible, or\nwithin three business days of receipt of the patient's application from the\nsuperintendent, the IDRE shall send notification of the assignment to the\nhealth care plan, physician, hospital, non-participating referred health care\nprovider and, for a patient initiated application, to the patient.
