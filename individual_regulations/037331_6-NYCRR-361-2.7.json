  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 361-2.7 - Design and operating requirements for storage facilities\n\nState Regulations\nA storage facility required to obtain a permit must, in\naddition to the requirements identified in section\n360.19\nof this Title, design, construct, maintain, and operate the facility in compliance with the following\ncriteria. (a) The minimum horizontal\nseparation distances from the perimeter of the storage facility must be, at a\nminimum, 50 feet to the property line, 100 feet to a surface water body or\npotable water well, and 500 feet (1,500 feet for a surface impoundment or open\ntank) to a residence, place of business, or public contact area. The separation\nrequirement does not apply to the landowner's or operator's\nresidence. (b) All samples obtained\nfrom the storage facility must be representative of the waste stored. The\nnumber of samples necessary will be determined by the department based on the\nwaste type and quantity of waste stored. (c) All storage facilities must be completely\nemptied, cleaned, and inspected at least once every 12 months or an acceptable\nleak detection procedure is employed. The department must be notified at least\nfive business days before any internal tank inspection begins. Any damage or\ndeterioration revealed by the inspection must be repaired before the storage\nfacility begins receiving waste again. (d) Surface impoundments must be constructed\nabove the special flood hazard area and must be constructed with a liner system\nto minimize percolation. The liner system must consist of either a minimum of\ntwo feet of compacted soil having a maximum remolded hydraulic conductivity of\n1 x 10\n-7\ncentimeters per second or a geomembrane\nmaterial approved by the department. The soil material particles must be able\nto pass through a one-inch screen. (e) For surface impoundments, the facility\nmust be monitorable and must not be located within the recharge area of a\nprimary or principal aquifer or in an unstable area. (f) If soil is used for a liner, the\nconstruction criteria in subparagraphs 363-6.7(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this\n\nTitle apply. (g) Surface\nimpoundments must maintain a minimum of two feet of freeboard. The bottom of\nthe impoundment liner system must be a minimum of five feet above both seasonal\nhigh groundwater and bedrock. (h) A minimum of one upgradient and two downgradient monitoring wells, or more as\ndetermined by the department, must be installed at a surface impoundment\nfacility. If multiple surface impoundments are used and are not near each\nother, then each impoundment must have separate monitoring well\narrays. (i) Existing water quality\nmust be established before placement of any waste in a surface\nimpoundment. (j) Quarterly sampling\nof the wells at surface impoundments must be conducted for the following\nparameters: chloride, nitrate, ammonia, sulfate, specific conductivity, total\nhardness, alkalinity, total organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand. In\naddition, for biosolids storage facilities, annual sampling is required for the\nfollowing parameters: arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, zinc, boron, barium, beryllium, cyanide, turbidity and\nvolatile organic compounds. All samples must be representative of the material\nsampled. All analyses must be performed by a laboratory certified by the\n\nDepartment of Health, using methods acceptable to the department, unless use of\nan alternate laboratory or method is authorized by the department. (1)\n\nThe department can require sampling for\nadditional parameters based on the type of waste stored and past monitoring\nresults. (2)\n\nSampling results\nreported to the department must include a copy of the laboratory results, sampling methods, sampling personnel, dates and times samples were taken, purge\nvolumes, field parameters and other relevant information. (3)\n\nThe department must be notified at least\nfive business days before each sampling event. (k) Storage facilities other than surface\nimpoundments may be constructed of concrete, steel, or other approved material. The storage facility must be designed to maintain a minimum of two feet of\nfreeboard. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
