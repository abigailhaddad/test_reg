  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.939 - Reassessment intervals\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn operator must comply with the following requirements\nin establishing the reassessment interval for the operator's covered pipeline\nsegments. (a) Pipelines\noperating at or above 30 percent SMYS. An operator must establish a reassessment interval for\neach covered segment operating at or above 30 percent SMYS in accordance with\nthe requirements of this section. The maximum reassessment interval by an\nallowable reassessment method is seven years. If an operator establishes a\nreassessment interval that is greater than seven years, the operator must, within the seven-year period, conduct a confirmatory direct assessment on the\ncovered segment, and then conduct the follow-up reassessment at the interval\nthe operator has established. A reassessment carried out using confirmatory\ndirect assessment must be done in accordance with section\n255.931\nof this Part. The table\nthat follows this section sets forth the maximum allowed reassessment\nintervals. (1)\n\nPressure test or\ninternal inspection or other equivalent technology. An operator that uses\npressure testing or internal inspection as an assessment method must establish\nthe reassessment interval for a covered pipeline segment by: (i) basing the interval on the identified\nthreats for the covered segment (see section\n255.917\nof this Part) and on the\nanalysis of the results from the last integrity assessment and from the data\nintegration and risk assessment required by section\n255.917\nof this Part; or\n(ii)\nusing the intervals specified for\ndifferent stress levels of pipeline (operating at or above 30 percent SMYS)\nlisted in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 5, table 3 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). (2)\n\nExternal corrosion direct\nassessment. An operator that uses ECDA that meets the requirements of sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part must\ndetermine the reassessment interval according to the requirements in paragraphs\n6.2 and 6.3 of NACE RP 0502 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). (3)\n\nInternal corrosion or SCC direct\nassessment. An operator that uses ICDA or SCCDA in accordance with the\nrequirements of sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part must\ndetermine the reassessment interval according to the following method. However, the reassessment interval cannot exceed those specified for direct assessment\nin ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 5, table 3. (i) Determine the largest defect most likely to remain in the covered segment and\nthe corrosion rate appropriate for the pipe, soil and protection\nconditions. (ii)\n\nUse the largest\nremaining defect as the size of the largest defect discovered in the SCC or\nICDA segment. (iii)\n\nEstimate the\nreassessment interval as half the time required for the largest defect to grow\nto a critical size. (b) Pipelines operating below 30\npercent SMYS. An operator must establish a reassessment interval for\neach covered segment operating below 30 percent SMYS in accordance with the\nrequirements of this section. The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable\nreassessment method is seven years. An operator must establish reassessment by\nat least one of the following. (1)\n\nReassessment by pressure test, internal inspection or other equivalent\ntechnology following the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section\nexcept that the stress level referenced in subparagraph (a)(1)(ii) of this\nsection would be adjusted to reflect the lower operating stress level. If an\nestablished interval is more than seven years, the operator must conduct by the\nseventh year of the interval either a confirmatory direct assessment in\naccordance with section\n255.931\nof this Part, or a low\nstress reassessment in accordance with section\n255.941\nof this Part. (2)\n\nReassessment by ECDA following the\nrequirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (3)\n\nReassessment by ICDA or SCCDA following\nthe requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (4)\n\nReassessment by confirmatory direct\nassessment at seven-year intervals in accordance with section\n255.931\nof this Part, with\nreassessment by one of the methods listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this\nsubdivision by year 20 of the interval. (5)\n\nReassessment by the low stress assessment\nmethod at seven-year intervals in accordance with section\n255.941\nof this Part with\nreassessment by one of the methods listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this\nsubdivision by year 20 of the interval. (6)\n\nThe following table sets forth the\nmaximum reassessment intervals. Also refer to Appendix 14-E.II for guidance on\nassessment methods and assessment schedule for transmission pipelines operating\nbelow 30 percent SMYS. In case of conflict between the rule and the guidance in\nthe appendix, the requirements of the rule control. An operator must comply with the following requirements\nin establishing a reassessment interval for a covered segment: Maximum Reassessment Interval\n\nAssessment\nmethod\n\nPipeline operating\nat or above 50% SMYS\nPipeline operating\nat or above 30% SMYS, up to 50% SMYS\nPipeline operating\nbelow 30% SMYS\nInternal Inspection Tool, Pressure Test or Direct Assessment....... 10 years (*)....... 15 years (*)....... 20 years (**)\n\nConfirmatory Direct Assessment....... 7 years....... 7 years....... 7 years\n\nLow Stress Reassessment....... Not applicable....... Not applicable....... 7 years+ ongoing actions specified in §\n255.941. * A confirmatory direct assessment as described in §\n255.931\nmust be conducted by year\n7 in a 10-year interval and years 7 and 14 of a 15-year interval. ** A low stress reassessment or confirmatory direct\nassessment must be conducted by years 7 and 14 of the\ninterval.
