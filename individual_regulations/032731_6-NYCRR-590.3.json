(b) Where the acquisition of real property\nused for a business or farm operation which is eligible for a payment under (a)\nabove causes a person to vacate a dwelling from other real property not\nacquired or move his or her personal property from other real property not\nacquired, the additional expenses of moving such personalty are eligible for\nthe appropriate moving payments. (c) Moving expenses shall not exceed the cost\nof transportation beyond 50 miles, except in the case of a business or farm\nwhen the State determines that relocation cannot be accomplished within the 50\nmile area; such exceptions may only be allowed to the nearest adequate and\navailable site. (d) The cost of\ninsurance premiums covering loss and damage of personal property while in\nstorage or transit will be eligible for reimbursement. Moving expenses shall\nnot include any direct losses or losses due to negligence. (e) The type of interest acquired does not\naffect the eligibility of relocation costs for reimbursement provided the\ninterest acquired is sufficient to cause displacement. If, in the opinion of\nthe commissioner, the acquisition of a portion of an entire premises or of\naccess thereto renders all or the remainder of such premises unsuitable for\ncontinued use and occupation or renders it without suitable access the removal\nof personal property from the entire property may be considered eligible for\nthe payment of moving expenses.

(g) Reimbursement for electrical wiring and\nplumbing charges and communication systems work covers only that work which is\ndirectly related to the personal property being relocated. Reimbursement is to\nexclude any costs of bringing electrical or plumbing services to the new site\nbut may include costs of labor and materials of distributing these services to\nthe personal property relocated. Reimbursement under this category excludes\ncosts of installing basic electrical wiring or plumbing to a new structure or\nthat normally found and expected in an existing structure and is intended to\ncover only those costs necessary to provide sufficient and adequate but not\nsuper-adequate utilities to operate the displaced business. (h) No reimbursement for overtime payments\nwill be allowed unless prior approval is received in writing from the\ndepartment. (i) It is expected that\nin anticipation of moving, the business or farm will reduce their inventories\nof stock or merchandise as much as practicable in order to have the removal\naccomplished in the most businesslike and economical manner. (j) Application for payment of moving\nexpenses must be made within 12 months after vacating of acquired premises or\nsix months after final award determination in a case litigated in the courts of\nthe State, whichever is the later.

The eligible\nperson, at his or her option, may accept a room count allowance or receive\nreimbursement on the actual cost basis. (l) In the case where the acquisition of real\nproperty causes the displacement of an advertising sign and such sign\nconstitutes the only improvement to the property acquired or where the\nacquisition causes a person to remove his or her advertising sign from real\nproperty not acquired, the owner of the advertising sign is eligible for\nappropriate moving payments. However, where the advertising sign is owned by\nand located on the business or farm displaced there will be no separate moving\nor related expenses considered.

The State will not pay the cost of disassembly\nfor resale of parts. (n) An\nadvertising sign, junkyard or automobile graveyard that is otherwise eligible\nfor moving payments will not be eligible when it is moved to a site in\nviolation of State, Federal or local regulations. (o) An otherwise eligible owner of an\nadvertising sign or a nonprofit business is not entitled to an \"in lieu of\"\nmoving expense payment. (p) If the\nactual costs incurred by the eligible person exceed the department's approved\nlimit of moving expenses, the eligible person may submit to the department a\nfully detailed explanation for the excess costs. The department's approval\nlimit may be adjusted accordingly. (q) The cost of necessary storage for a\nperiod not to exceed six months may be considered as part of moving expenses\nand will be subject to the following provisions: (1)\n\nMoving expenses may include the cost of\nmoving into dead storage at the prevailing rate in a commercial storage\nfacility or warehouse; no payment will be made for storage on premises owned or\noccupied by the eligible person, members of his or her immediate family, or his\nlegal or financial representative.

(t) In the case of a hardship where advance\npayment of moving expenses is requested, the eligible person must submit in\nadvance a written application setting forth the full extent and circumstances\nof the hardship. A written determination will be made by the department. If the\ndepartment determines a hardship exists, an advanced payment of reasonable\nnecessary moving expenses may be made.
