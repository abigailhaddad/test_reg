  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-9.7 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following examples assume that the corporation has\n(1) no PNOLC subtraction in the year and (2) at least the amount of computed\nNOLD required to be utilized is available for deduction. While some examples\nmay highlight multiple rules contained in this Subpart, the introductory text\nof the example is intended to highlight the main rule highlighted in each such\nexample. Example 1: This example is intended to highlight that New York\ninvestment capital losses must be added back in computing the business income\nbase and any net operating loss (NOL). Taxpayer has a Federal loss of ($500,000), which includes\na ($40,000) New York investment capital loss that resulted from the sale of its\ninvestment capital. The taxpayer must adjust its Federal taxable income (FTI)\nto account for such loss when computing the business income base and its\nNOL. Federal taxable income (loss)\n($500,000)\n\nAdjustment for New York investment capital\nloss\n$40,000\n\nFederal taxable income (loss) adjusted for New\n\nYork investment capital loss\n($460,000)\n\nExample 2: This example is intended to highlight that the NOLD\nrequired to be utilized is the amount that reduces the tax on the business\nincome base to the higher of the capital base tax or the fixed dollar\nminimum. Taxpayer X computes its 2020 NOLD of $6,730,769 required\nto be utilized as follows: NOL Deduction Schedule\n\nApportioned total business income after the\nPNOLC but before the NOLD\n$7,500,000\n\nBusiness income base tax rate\n6.50%\nProduct of apportioned total business income\nafter the PNOLC but before the NOLD and the business income base tax\nrate\n$487,500\n\nCapital base tax\n$50,000\nFDM\n$20,000\n\nGreater of capital base tax and FDM\n$50,000\n\nDifference between (a) product of apportioned\ntotal business income after PNOLC but before the NOLD and the business income\nbase tax rate and (b) greater of capital base tax and FDM\n$437,500\n\nBusiness income base tax rate\n6.50%\nNet operating loss deduction required to be\nutilized ($437,500/6.5%)\n$6,730,769\n\nExample 3: This example is intended to highlight that the NOLD may\noffset income from investment capital that remains in business income due to\nthe 8 percent of ENI limitation on gross investment income. Taxpayer Y sustained an NOL in 2021 of ($3,750). It\nproperly elected to waive the carryback period so the NOL is carried forward to\n2022. In 2022, the gross investment income limitation reduced the amount the\ntaxpayer was allowed to deduct as investment income from $500 to $360 (8% of\n$4,500). As such, $140 of income from investment capital was considered\nbusiness income in 2022.

Company A, a calendar-year taxpayer, was incorporated and\nbegan doing business in New York as of 1/1/2019. Company A had New York income\nand losses as follows: NOL Schedule\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n\nApportioned total business income after the\nPNOLC but before the NOLD\n$7,500,000\n$3,500,000\n($10,000,000)\n$2,000,000\n\nBusiness income base tax rate\n6.5%\n6.5%\n6.5%\nProduct of apportioned total business income\nafter PNOLC but before the NOLD and the business income base tax rate\n$487,500\n$227,500\n$130,000\n\nCapital base tax\n$28,000\n$25,000\n$17,000\nFDM\n$50,000\n$50,000\n$50,000\n\nGreater of capital base tax and FDM\n$50,000\n$50,000\n$50,000\n\nDifference between (a) product of apportioned\ntotal business income after PNOLC but before the NOLD and the business income\nbase tax rate and (b) greater of capital base tax and FDM\n$437,500\n$177,500\n$80,000\n\nBusiness income base tax rate\n6.5%\n6.5%\n6.5%\nNOLD required to be utilized (if\navailable)\n$6,730,769\n$2,730,769\n$1,230,769\nNOL sustained\n($10,000,000)\nNOL carryback from 2021 to 2019\n($6,730,769)\n<---------------\n$6,730,769\nNOL carryback from 2021 to 2020\n($2,730,769)\n<----------$2,730,769\nNOL carryforward from 2021 to 2022\n$538,462\n-------->($538,462)\n\nBusiness income base\n$769,231\n$769,231\n($10,000,000)\n$1,461,538\n\nBusiness income base tax\n$50,000\n$50,000\n$0\n$95,000\n\nExample 5: This example is intended to highlight how a combined\ngroup member computes its share of NOLs sustained in the loss year. Taxpayers L, M, N & O began doing business and\nproperly filed a combined report in New York in the 2021. As the combined group\nsustained an NOL, each member computes its share of the NOL as follows: Computation of the NOL for\n\nMembers of a Combined Group\n(1)\n(2)\n\nCombined Group\n2021 Business Income/(Losses)\n\nBusiness Loss by Member\n\nMember's business losses as a % of total\nbusiness losses of all members with losses\n\nMember's 2021 NOL (2021 Total BI*(1))\nL\n($750)\n($750)\n20.0%\n($700)\nM\n($2,000)\n($2,000)\n53.3%\n($1,867)\nN\n$250\n$0\n0.0%\n$0\nO\n($1,000)\n($1,000)\n26.7%\n($933)\n\nTotals\n($3,500)\n($3,750)\n100.00%\n($3,500)\n\nIf taxpayers L, M, N, and O file a combined report in\n2022, the NOL carryforward available for use by the group would be $3,500. However, if taxpayers L,M, and N file a combined report in 2022, the group\nwould have an NOL carryforward available for use by the group of $2,567 ($700 +\n$1,867) and taxpayer O would have an NOL carryforward available for use of $933\non its separate return in 2022. Example 6: This example is intended to highlight how a combined\ngroup member computes its share of NOLs and how the share of such NOLs is\ncarried back to previous years. In taxable year 2020, Corporation A began doing business\nin New York and filed a separate New York State tax return. Corporations B and\nC also became subject to tax in taxable year 2020 and properly filed a combined\nreport. In 2021, Corporation A was purchased by unrelated group that includes\ncorporations B and C. The newly formed combined group A, B, and C properly\nfiles a combined New York State return and sustains an NOL in 2021. Each member\nof the combined group must compute its share of the NOL sustained in 2021 based\non its share of the loss. Corporation A may carry back its share of the 2021\nloss to its separately filed 2020 return and Corporations B and C may carry\nback their share of 2021 losses to the 2020 combined report filed by combined\ngroup B and C.

As its carryback of $1,750,000 is less than\nthe NOLD required to be utilized (if available), Corporation A completely\nexhausted its 2021 NOL. While Corporations B and C carried back a portion of\nthe 2021 NOLs, the total NOL available for carryback of $2,575,000 is greater\nthan the NOLD required to be utilized of $730,769. As such, Corporations B and\nC must determine their share of NOL carryback based on their share of losses in\n2021. Of the $730,769 carried back to 2020, Corporation B's share is $361,837\n(1,275,000/2,575,000 * $730,769) and Corporation C's share is $368,932\n(1,300,000/2,575,000 * $730,769). Corporation B's 2021 NOL carryforward is\n$913,163 ($1,275,000 - $361,837) and Corporation C's 2021 NOL carryforward is\n$931,068 ($1,300,000-$368,932). Example 7: This example is intended to highlight how NOLs are\nimpacted by subsequent adjustments to the loss year as well as the time period\nfor assessing deficiencies when an adjusted NOL is carried to other\nperiods. Corporation B sustains an NOL for the taxable year ending\n12/31/2018 and on 10/15/2019 files its first amended 2015 CT-3 form to\ncarryback the NOL of $50,000 to its 2015 taxable year ($100,000 business loss\nmultiplied by a BAF of 50%). Corporation B receives a refund of $3,550 for the\n2015 taxable year. Based on a subsequent correction to the BAF by the\ntaxpayer that changes its 2018 BAF from 50% to 80%, it is determined that the\nactual NOL for the taxable year ending 12/31/2018 was $80,000 ($100,000\nbusiness loss multiplied by a BAF of 80%). Corporation B files a second amended\nreport for the 2015 taxable year in July 2020 to claim the additional refund\nfor 2015. In December 2020, the IRS completes their examination of\n\nCorporation B and makes their final determination. The IRS required Corporation\nB to recognize in 2018 a deferred receipt from undelivered sales. Corporation B\nfiles a second amended 2018 report timely to report the correction to its 2018\nFTI and also amend its BAF since the Revenue Agent Report (RAR) directly\nimpacted the 2018 BAF. As the RAR changed the 2018 NOLD, the Department\ncalculates Corporation B's proper liability for the 2015 tax year upon\nreceiving a copy of the RAR. As a result, Corporation B owes $1,207 for the\n2015 and the Department may assess a deficiency due by the authority granted\nunder section 1083(c)(4). 2018\n\nAs Filed\n\nFirst Amended\n\nSecond Amended\n\nTotal business income before RAR\n($100,000)\n($100,000)\n($100,000)\n\nAdjustment to federal taxable income due to\nRAR\n$10,000\n\nTotal business income after RAR\n($100,000)\n($100,000)\n($90,000)\nBAF\n50%\n80%\n70%\nBusiness income base\n($50,000)\n($80,000)\n($63,000)\n2015\n\nOriginal\n\nFirst Amended\n\nSecond Amended\n\nThird Amended\n\nApportioned Business Income before NOLD\n$300,000\n$300,000\n$300,000\n$300,000\n2018 NOL carryback to 2015\n$0\n($50,000)\n($80,000)\n($63,000)\n2015 business income base\n$300,000\n$250,000\n$220,000\n$237,000\n\nBusiness income tax base current year tax\nrate\n7.10%\n7.10%\n7.10%\n7.10%\nBusiness income base tax\n$21,300\n$17,750\n$15,620\n$16,827\n\nPrepayments\n$21,000\n$21,300\n$17,750\n$15,620\n\nRefund/Additional Tax*\n$300\n($3,550)\n($2,130)\n$1,207\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
