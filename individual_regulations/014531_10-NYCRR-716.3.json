  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 716.3 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nRehabilitation facilities shall be constructed to\nmaintain a safe and functional physical environment for all services that the\nlicensed operator of the rehabilitation facility provides. The sizes of the\nvarious departments shall depend upon the program requirements and the\norganization of services within the facility. Some functions allotted separate\nspaces or rooms in these minimum requirements may be combined if the best\nstandards of safety and patient care are not compromised. Some of the areas may\nbe omitted from the facility if the necessary services are conveniently\navailable elsewhere. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n716.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
