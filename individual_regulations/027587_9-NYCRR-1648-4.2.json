  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1648-4.2 - Recording subsidy revenue\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nentry taking subsidy into revenue shall be made at the close of the fiscal\nyear, after all adjusting entries have been made and the books are about to be\nclosed. At this point, the amount of State subsidy computed as being payable\nagainst the operating deficit of the project for the fiscal year (see §\n1648-3.7\n) shall be taken into\nproject revenue, to the extent of the credit balance available in account 2250, by the following journal entry: Entry (3): Debit: Account 2250, Prepaid State of New York\n\nSubsidies $XXX\nCredit: Account 3810, State of New York Subsidy\n$XXX\n(b) The local cash\nsubsidy, if any, payable against the operating deficit for the fiscal year, is\nrecorded in a similar manner. (c) If the balances in the prepaid subsidies accounts (account 2250 and 2260) are\nless than the amounts of subsidies computed to be taken into project revenue\nfor the fiscal year, or if there are no balances available, the following\ntypical journal entry accruing the subsidy, to the extent that the balances in\nthe respective prepaid subsidies accounts are not available, shall be made: Entry (4): Debit: Account 1141, Accrued Subsidies, State of\n\nNew York $XXX\nCredit: Account 3810, State of New York Subsidy\n$XXX\n(d) The entries\nclosing the books for the fiscal year may then be made (see §\n1647-7.5\n) local agencies should, however, bear in mind that subsidies taken into revenue by them may be subject\nto adjustment as a result of the division's audit and that the final amount of\nsubsidy for a given fiscal year will not be definitively determined except\nafter such audit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1648-4.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
