(d) The\nterm year shall be defined to mean an academic year with respect to the\nchargeback of amounts on account of capital costs.

Such college may deduct the amount of the\nlocal share and the State's share of such approved project from the accumulated\nfund prior to calculating the additional capital charge referred to in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision; and\n(2)\nany college which is using at least 50\npercent of the capital charge monies collected in the current year for the\nsponsor's share of expenditures as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section\nmay charge $300 during such year; provided that if the fund exceeds $500,000\nbut is less than $1,000,000 the college may charge $200 annually, and if the\nfund is equal to or greater than $1,000,000 no charge may be collected. Any\ncollege using less than 50 percent of the monies currently collected may not\ncollect a capital charge. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
