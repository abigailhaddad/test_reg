(1)\n\nPersons will be eligible for admission to\na residential program for victims of domestic violence when: (i) such person is seeking temporary shelter; and\n(ii)\nsuch person is a victim of\ndomestic violence. (2)\nA\nformer resident of a residential program will be eligible for readmission to a\nresidential program if such person meets the requirements specified in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision as a result of the occurrence of a new\ndomestic violence incident after the victim had departed from the previous\nresidential program. (b) Method of determining eligibility pursuant to 408.4 of this Part. (1)\n(i) A\nperson will be deemed eligible for admission to a residential program for\nvictims of domestic violence when such person provides information that he or\nshe is a victim of domestic violence as defined by section\n408.2\n(i) of this\n\nPart and is seeking temporary shelter, emergency services and care. The person\nmay provide verbal or documentary information to establish such eligibility. Once information establishing that the person is a victim of domestic violence\nand is seeking temporary shelter, emergency services and care is provided as\nrequired in this subparagraph, the social services district may not require the\nprovision of any additional information for the purpose of determining\neligibility. (ii)\n\nWhen a person\ngoes directly to a residential program, the residential program will be\nresponsible for determining the person's initial eligibility. (iii)\n\nWhen a person goes directly to a social\nservices district, the district will be responsible for determining a person's\ninitial eligibility or for referring the person to a residential program for an\neligibility determination. (2)\n\nPersons deemed eligible for admission to\na residential program must also meet any additional admission criteria\nestablished by the residential program. (c) Notification of eligibility\ndeterminations. (1)\n\nWhen a residential program\ndetermines that a person is eligible for admission and admits such person into\nthe program, it must provide notice [by telephone] of such admission to the\nsocial services district where the person resided at the time of the domestic\nviolence incident. Such notice must be given on or before the first working day\nfollowing admission; provided, however, that personally identifying information\nmay only be disclosed to a social services district if the program has received\nwritten, informed and time-limited consent from the victim of domestic violence\nand head of household to share that information. If the residential program is\nnot located in the social services district in which the victim of domestic\nviolence resided at the time the domestic violence incident occurred, the\nperson may submit an application for public assistance and care to the district\nin which the program is located. In such a case, notice [by telephone] of\nadmission must also be given by the residential program to the social services\ndistrict in which the residential program is located on or before the first\nworking day following such admission. The social services district in which the\nresidential program is located must forward the completed application, within\nfive days of its receipt, to the social services district in which the person\nresided at the time of the domestic violence incident in accordance with\nsection\n311.4\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nEach social services\ndistrict must designate a representative to receive notices of admissions made\nby residential programs pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision and to\nserve as the liaison to the residential programs on any payment or program\nissues relating to the admission of victims of domestic violence. (3)\n\nWhen a social services district receives\nnotice that a person who is a victim of domestic violence for whom it is\nfinancially responsible pursuant to section\n408.5\nof this Part has been\nadmitted into a program located in another social services district, the social\nservices district in which the domestic violence incident occurred must inform\nthe person of any bed available in a residential program located within such\ndistrict, regardless of whether a contract exists between such district and the\nresidential program. The person may choose whether or not to return to the\nsocial services district in which the domestic violence incident occurred in\norder to obtain services from a residential program within that\ndistrict.
