Tit. 22 § 1200.1.18 - Duties to prospective clients\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as provided in Rule 1.18(e), a person who consults with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a\nclient-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter is a \"prospective client\n\"\n(b) Even when no\nclient-lawyer relationship ensues, a lawyer who has learned information from a\nprospective client shall not use or reveal that information, except as Rule 1.9\nwould permit with respect to information of a former client. (c) A lawyer subject to\nparagraph (b) shall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to\nthose of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if\nthe lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be\nsignificantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in\nparagraph (d). If a lawyer is disqualified from representation under this\nparagraph, no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may\nknowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter, except as\nprovided in paragraph (d). (d) When the lawyer has received\ndisqualifying information as defined in paragraph (c), representation is\npermissible if: (1)\nboth the\naffected client and the prospective client have given informed consent, confirmed in writing; or\n(2)\nthe lawyer who received the\ninformation took reasonable measures to avoid exposure to more disqualifying\ninformation than was reasonably necessary to determine whether to represent the\nprospective client; and\n(i) the firm acts promptly and reasonably to notify, as appropriate, lawyers and\nnonlawyer personnel within the firm that the personally disqualified lawyer is\nprohibited from participating in the representation of the current\nclient; (ii)\nthe\nfirm implements effective screening procedures to prevent the flow of\ninformation about the matter between the disqualified lawyer and the others in\nthe firm; (iii)\nthe\ndisqualified lawyer is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and\n(iv)\nwritten notice is\npromptly given to the prospective client; and\n(3)\na reasonable lawyer would\nconclude that the law firm will be able to provide competent and diligent\nrepresentation in the matter. (e) A person is not a prospective\nclient within the meaning of paragraph (a) if the person: (1)\ncommunicates information\nunilaterally to a lawyer, without any reasonable expectation that the lawyer is\nwilling to discuss the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship; or\n(2)\ncommunicates\nwith a lawyer for the purpose of disqualifying the lawyer from handling a\nmaterially adverse representation on the same or a substantially related\nmatter.
