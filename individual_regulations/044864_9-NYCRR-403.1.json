  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 403.1 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The State\nof New York is abundant in natural, scenic and recreational sources. The\nmagnificent State parks, recreational and historic sites administered by the\n\nOffice of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the Palisades\n\nInterstate Park Commission encourage and facilitate the use and enjoyment of\nsuch resources by the public and thereby promote and enhance the well-being of\neach individual. (b) State parks, however, contain waterfalls, waterways, chasms, slopes and other natural\nfeatures which, by their nature, may constitute hazards and present dangers to\npersons approaching them. (c) In\naddition to the dangers presented by natural hazards, the use of State parks\nand historic sites by the public for varied and divergent purposes may also, if\nnot controlled, endanger the safety of members thereof and tend to deny certain\nindividuals equality of opportunity in the use and enjoyment of these\nresources. (d) Therefore, to\nenhance and promote the safety, well-being and enjoyment of each individual in\nthe use of a State park, recreational and historic site and to assure to each\nindividual equality of opportunity in the use and enjoyment of such system, the\nrules and regulations set forth in this Subchapter are hereby established to\ngovern the conduct of the public with respect thereto. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n403.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
