  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 151.15 - Preparation of New York State income tax returns\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nEach taxpayer should carefully prepare\nhis New York State income tax return so as to fully and clearly set forth the\ndata required to be stated therein. Incomplete or incorrect New York State\nincome tax returns will not ordinarily be accepted as meeting the requirements\nof law. However, a written statement filed by a taxpayer which fully and\nclearly discloses all items of his income and the deductions thereform, even\nthough not made on the prescribed form, may be accepted as a tentative New York\n\nState income tax return sufficient to relieve the taxpayer from liability for\nthe penalties imposed for delinquent filing, provided that it is filed within\nthe prescribed time and is accompanied by full payment of any income tax shown\nto be due thereon, and provided further that it is replaced without unnecessary\ndelay by a New York State income tax return made on the prescribed\nform. (2)\n\nThe Tax Commission will\npermit, under prescribed conditions and upon compliance with official\nspecifications, the reproduction of certain New York State income tax forms. Official New York State income tax forms used for reporting income for taxable\nyears commencing on or after January 1, 1972 under article 22 of the Tax Law\nmay be reproduced and filed with the New York State Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance and computer-prepared forms may be substituted for the official forms, if they comply with the standards and requirements prescribed by the New York\n\nState Department of Taxation and Finance. (b) Reporting whole dollar amounts. (1)\n\nIf the amount of any item which must be\nshown on a New York State income tax return is not a whole dollar amount, the\ntaxpayer may, if he so elects, report it as a whole dollar amount. If he elects\nto do this, he must treat any part of a dollar in excess of 49 cents as a whole\ndollar, but may disregard any part of dollar not in excess of 49 cents. That\nis, if the exact amount is $1,234.50, he must report it as $1,235, but if the\nexact amount is $1,234.49, he may report it as $1,234. (2)\n\nThe election to use whole dollar amounts\napplies only to items which are required to be shown on a New York State income\ntax return; it may not be used in computing the amount of such items. For\nexample, if the taxpayer is required to report on his New York State income tax\nreturn the total of 101 transactions, each of which produced income or gain of\n$10.49, the taxpayer may not disregard the extra 49 cents in each of these; the\ntotal income or gain derived from these transactions is $1,059.49, and the\nright of election to report whole dollar amounts permits the taxpayer to\ndisregard only the 49 cents included in this total. (c) Assessment, refund, etc., in whole dollar\namounts. The Tax Commission, in any determination, assessment, addition, collection, refund or credit to be made pursuant to the provisions of this\n\nSubchapter, may disregard the fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to\none-half dollar or more, in which case it will be increased to one\ndollar. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n151.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
