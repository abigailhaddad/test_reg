  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.53 - Executive Order No. 53: Establishing a New York State Commission on Child Support. [*]\nState Regulations\n\nIt is estimated that one half of the children born this\nyear will live in single parent households before reaching the age of 18. Presently, 30 percent of the nine million single parent households live below\nthe poverty line. Although the majority of the children in these families have\nsupport obligations established on their behalf, many of them receive only\npartial payments or none at all. Often these families are forced to turn to\npublic assistance because of nonsupport by an absent parent. Willful nonsupport of children by financially able parents\nis tantamount to neglect. This phenomenon is increasing and we must address the\nproblem as we would any other illegality. It is essential that changes be made\nif the laws and procedures are ineffective. All children in the State of New\n\nYork, regardless of their financial status, are entitled to be supported. It is\nthe responsibility of the State as the ultimate protector of the children's\nwell-being to insure this support. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby establish a New York State Commission on\n\nChild Support. The commission shall: (1)\nexamine, investigate and study the\noperation of the State' s child and spousal support system, including existing\nlaws, judicial proceedings and enforcement mechanisms to determine their\neffectiveness; (2)\ndetermine if all\nfamilies are treated equitably under the system-both families receiving Aid to\n\nFamilies with Dependent Children and those not dependent on public\nassistance; (3)\nexamine, study and\ninvestigate specific problems such as the enforcement of interstate\nobligations, the establishment of appropriate objective standards for support, and visitation; (4)\nassess the\navailability, cost and effectiveness of existing enforcement services and\ninquire into the potential for cost reduction through more comprehensive\nutilization of existing enforcement mechanisms; (5)\ndetermine the extent to which existing\nlaws and permissible sanctions for nonsupport are being equitably and fully\nutilized; (6)\ndetermine the extent\nto which responsibilities and options derived from part D of title IV of the\n\nSocial Security Act are being implemented in New York State; and\n(7)\nrecommend to the Governor and the\n\nLegislature methods for improving the child support system and making it more\nresponsive to the needs of all children deemed eligible for support. The commission shall have no fewer than 20 members\nrepresenting all aspects of the child support system, including the\n\nLegislature; the Judiciary; the Executive; custodial and noncustodial parents; the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services; representatives of local\nsocial services agencies; the Executive Director of the Women's Division; the\n\nDirector of the Council on Children and Families; practicing attorneys in the\narea of family law; representatives of child welfare and social services\nagencies; and representatives of organizations concerned with the problems of\nchild support. The Governor shall designate a chairperson. The commission shall make a written report of its findings\nand recommendations, including the need for legislative changes, if any, to the\n\nGovernor and the Legislature, on or before October 1, 1985.
