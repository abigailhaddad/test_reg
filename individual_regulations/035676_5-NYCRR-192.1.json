  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 5 § 192.1 - Claiming credits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nparticipant must submit evidence of achieving the applicable job and investment\nrequirements to the department in order to receive benefits under the\nprogram. (b) For purposes of\nsatisfying requirements other than the additional requirements for Green CHIPS\nprojects listed under 191.4 of this Title, such evidence may include, but not\nbe limited to, submission of the NYS-45 form and, where applicable, submission\nof receipts specifically documenting research and development expenditures\nand/or qualified investments as such terms are defined in section\n352\nof\nthe Economic Development Law. This evidence will serve to demonstrate that the\nparticipant has satisfied all applicable eligibility requirements other than\nadditional requirements for Green CHIPS projects and form the basis for the tax\ncredit components. For purposes of satisfying the additional eligibility\nrequirements for Green CHIPS projects, the participant must also satisfy the\nreporting requirements outlined in Section\n194.2\nof this Title. (c) If a participant fails to demonstrate\nthat it has satisfied the eligibility requirements set forth in section\n191.2\n(h) of this\n\nTitle, the department shall not issue such participant a certificate of tax\ncredit. If a participant certified as a regionally significant project fails to\ndemonstrate that it has satisfied the eligibility requirements set forth in\nsection\n191.2\n(h) of this\n\nTitle, the department shall not issue such participant a certificate of tax\ncredit. Provided, however, if the participant fails to fully satisfy the\napplicable job creation projections in the preliminary schedule of benefits, the commissioner shall reduce the tax credit to an amount in proportion to the\npercentage of the job creation achieved. If the participant fails to create at\nleast 75 percent of the job creation projections, the commissioner shall not\nissue such participant a certificate of tax credit. (d) If a participant certified pursuant to\nsection\n191.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle fails to demonstrate that it has 25 full-time job equivalents or, if such\nbusiness is a business entity operating predominantly in manufacturing, five\nfull-time job equivalents or fails to demonstrate that is has a benefit-cost\nratio of at least 10 to one, the department shall not issue such participant a\ntax credit. (e) After reviewing\nsuch evidence and finding it sufficient, the department shall calculate the\nappropriate amount of tax credit and issue a certificate of tax credit for one\ntaxable year. The certificate shall specify the exact amount of each of the tax\ncredit components that a participant may claim pursuant to Part 193 of this\n\nTitle, and shall specify the taxable year in which such credit may be claimed. The tax credit components may only be claimed on tax returns for the tax year\nindicated on the certificate. If the participant is a business entity that\npasses through the tax credit components to its owners (such as partners in a\npartnership or members in a limited liability company), such owners can only\nclaim their share of the credit components on the tax return that corresponds\nto the tax year indicated on the certificate issued to the participant. In\norder to receive a certificate of tax credit for subsequent taxable years, the\nparticipant must submit to the department a performance report demonstrating\nthat the participant continues to satisfy the eligibility criteria specified in\nsections\n353\nand\n354\n(2)\nof the Economic Development Law. If such\neligibility criteria are met, a participant can receive tax credits based on\nthe interim job, investment or research and development milestones indicated in\nthe preliminary schedule of benefits in accordance with subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (f) A participant's\nincrease in employment, qualified investment, or Federal research and\ndevelopment tax credit attributable to research and development activities in\n\nNew York State above its projections listed in its application shall not result\nin an increase in tax benefits under this regulation. However, if the\nparticipant's expenditures are less than the estimated amounts, the credit\ncomponent shall be less than the estimate. (g) No costs used by an entertainment company\nas the basis for the allowance of a tax credit described in this Part shall be\nused by such entertainment company to claim any other credit allowed pursuant\nto the Tax Law.
