  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 65-2.6 - Other sources of first-party benefits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where more than one source of first-party benefits required by article 51 of the New York Insurance Law and article 6 or 8 of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law is available and applicable to an eligible injured person in any one accident, the self-insurer is liable to an eligible injured person only for an amount equal to the maximum amount that the eligible injured person is entitled to recover from the self-insurer, divided by the number of available and applicable sources of required first-party benefits. (b) An eligible injured person shall not recover duplicate benefits for the same elements of loss required to be recovered by the self-insurer or any mandatory first-party automobile or no- fault automobile insurance coverage issued in compliance with the laws of another state. If the eligible injured person is entitled to benefits under any such mandatory first-party automobile or no-fault automobile insurance for the same elements of loss required to be covered by the self- insurer, the self-insurer shall be liable only for an amount equal to the proportion that the total amount available from the self-insurer bears to the sum of the amount available from the self- insurer and the amount available under such mandatory insurance for the common elements of loss. However, where another state's mandatory first-party or no-fault automobile insurance law provides unlimited coverage available to an eligible injured person for an element of loss required to be covered by the self-insurer, the obligation of the self-insurer is to share equally for that element of loss with such other mandatory insurance until the $50,000, or $75,000 if provided, limit available from the self-insurer is exhausted by the payment of that element of loss and any other elements of loss. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n65-2.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
