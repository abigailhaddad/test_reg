  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 57.3 - Light service devices and systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) These are for use with trailers not\nexceeding 10,000 pounds gross weight. This includes but is not limited to such\ntypes as the utility, boat, camping, travel and other trailers which are\nnormally towed by the conventional passenger car, or similarly constructed\nvehicle or light-duty truck. This section is intended basically for the\nball-and-socket type of primary connecting system. It is not limited to this\ntype alone. (b) Light service hitch\nnomenclature. The following nomenclature has been adopted for uniformity in the\nterms used for this portion of the primary connecting system: (1)\n\nWeight distributing hitch means a\nmechanical device that connects the trailer to the towing vehicle, and by means\nof leverage applied on both trailer and car structures or axles, when properly\nadjusted, distributes the imposed vertical load at the hitch and coupling\nconnection between the structures or axles of towing vehicle and trailer. The\ntowing vehicle thus loaded tends to retain a level position with respect to the\nroad. (2)\n\nWeight carrying hitch. (i) Bumper hitch means a mechanical or\nstructural device that bolts or is otherwise fastened to the bumper of the\ntowing vehicle. No connection is made to other structural members of the towing\nvehicle. (ii)\n\nFrame hitch means a\nmechanical and/or structural device that bolts or is otherwise fastened to at\nleast two of the towing vehicle structural members which can include frame, unitized body, and bumper. (c) Trailer classification. (1)\n\nClass 1--Trailers with a gross weight\n(trailer weight including load) not exceeding 2,000 pounds. (2)\n\nClass 2--Trailers, with a gross weight\n(trailer weight including load) over 2,000 pounds but not exceeding 3,500\npounds. (3)\n\nClass 3--Trailers, with\na gross weight (trailer weight including load) over 3,500 pounds but not\nexceeding 5,000 pounds. (4)\n\nClass\n4--Trailers, with a gross weight (trailer weight including load) over 5,000\npounds but not exceeding 10,000 pounds. (d) Couplings. (1)\n\nCoupling classification. There shall be four major strength classifications, or\ndesignations, of couplings. The designation shall be based on the maximum gross\ntrailer weight the coupling is qualified to tow. The No. 1 couplings shall be\nused for towing class 1 trailers; No. 2 couplings for class 2 or smaller\ntrailers; No. 3 couplings for class 3 or smaller trailers; and No. 4 couplings\nfor class 4 or smaller trailers. This is not intended to limit the number or\nvariety of couplings in a given class, or designation. (2)\n\nCoupling ultimate strength. Each\ncoupling, when subjected to static bench tests, shall exhibit the minimum\nbreaking strengths required in table 1 for its strength classification, or\ndesignation. Each type of test load shall be applied independently. (3)\n\nAttachment of couplings. Each coupling is\nto be mounted to the trailer attaching member by bolting, welding or riveting\nin such manner that the maximum loading specified for the coupling designation\nin table 1 is safely and adequately transferred to that member. (4)\n\nProvisions for safety. Each coupling, regardless of classification, or designation must be equipped with a manually\noperated mechanism so adapted as to prevent disengagement of the unit while in\noperation. In addition to this positive locking mechanism, the coupling shall\nbe so designed that the trailer can be disconnected from the towing vehicle\nregardless of the angle of the trailer to the towing vehicle. (e) Hitches. (1)\n\nHitch rating. Hitches shall be rated by\nthe maximum gross trailer weight and the vertica l tongue weight each is\nqualified to tow. (2)\n\nHitch\nstrength requirements. Each hitch, when subjected to a static bench test, shall\nconform to the minimum strength requirements contained in table 2. (3)\n\nAttachment of hitch. Each hitch shall be\nattached to the structural member or members of the towing vehicle in such a\nmanner that the tension, compression and transverse thrust loads shown in table\n2 are transferred to the towing vehicle without residual distortion or failure\nof either the attachment or the vehicle structure which would affect the safe\ntowing of trailers, as defined in table 2. (4)\n\nVertical load on hitch. The weight load\ncarried by the hitch at its connection with the trailer coupling shall not, when on a level surface, exceed the maximum tongue weight load recommended by\nthe manufacturer for the hitch but in no case shall the tongue weight load\nexceed that specified in table 3 for the class of trailers and type of hitch\nused. (f) Safety chains\nand attaching means. Each towing system shall include safety chains. (1)\n\nStrength requirements. Each safety chain\nand each attaching means shall meet strength requirements as shown in table 4\nand defined in section\n57.2. (2)\n\nInstallation and connections. The means\nof attachment of safety chains shall be located equally distant from and on\nopposite sides of the longitudinal centerline of the towing vehicle and of the\ntrailer, except that where a single length of safety chain is connected to one\nsingle means of attachment of a trailer such single attachment shall be on the\ntrailer longitudinal centerline. Each means of attachment shall not be common\nwith or utilize fasteners common with a ball or coupling. No welding operation\nshall be performed on a safety chain subsequent to its manufacture. Safety\nchains shall be so connected that the slack for each length of chain between\ntrailer and towing vehicle is the same and is not more than necessary to permit\nthe proper turning of the vehicles. When passing forward to the towing vehicle, safety chains must be crossed under the tongue and oriented in such a manner as\nto prevent the tongue from dropping to the ground and to maintain connection in\nthe event of failure of the primary connecting system. (See figures 2 and 3, section\n57.5.)\n(g) Identification. (1)\n\nMarking. Each coupling and each hitch\nshall be legibly and permanently marked to show: (i) Manufacturer's or distributor's name, initials, or trademark, trade name or code symbol. (Code symbol shall mean one\nassigned and approved by appropriate regulatory authority.)\n(ii)\n\nModel number, part number, or style and, for couplings only, the class. (iii)\n\nMaximum gross trailer weight to be\ndrawn. (iv)\n\nMaximum vertical tongue\nweight to be imposed on the ball or other points of connection. (2)\n\nLabeling. Each crate, box or\nother container in which a coupling or hitch is packed shall be imprinted or\nlabeled to display at least the same information required in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision for marking, except that the maximum gross weight to be drawn\nmust be shown for each coupling regardless of class. Also, the year, make, and\nmodel of each vehicle on which a hitch may be installed and meet the\nrequirements of this Part shall be shown but may be shown on an enclosed sheet, or sheets, separate from the imprintation, or labeling, or on hitch\nmanufacturer's application tables which are kept available at the locations\nwhere the device or system is sold, either for resale or for use. However, this\nprovision shall not apply to hitches adaptable to a large number of vehicles\nand designated to be a universal type. (h) Full trailers. Light service connecting\ndevices or systems used with full trailers not exceeding 10,000 pounds gross\nweight shall meet all requirements of this section except as shown below: (1)\n\nCouplings for full trailers. The vertical\nstrengths shown in table 1 shall not be required. Such couplings shall be\nlegibly and permanently marked \"For Full Trailers Only\". (2)\n\nHitches for full trailers, (i) The vertical strengths shown in table 2\nshall not be required. However, the hitch must be capable of supporting the\nentire weight of the tow bar, drawbar or tongue and when undergoing the other\ntests shown in table 2 must not exhibit any vertical residual distortion which\nwould affect safe towing, as defined in table 2. Such hitches shall be legibly\nand permanently marked \"For Full Trailers Only\". (ii)\nA weight carrying hitch may be used in\nlieu of a weight distributing hitch. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
