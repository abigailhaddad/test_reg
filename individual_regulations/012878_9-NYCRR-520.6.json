  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 520.6 - Vacation of suspension\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nGenerally. (i) Only the commander who imposed the\npunishment and suspended it, his successor-in-command, or superior authority\nmay vacate a suspension. (ii)\n\nSuspension of punishment may be vacated only if the offender commits an offense\npunishable under the Military Law after the date of suspension and before the\nsuspension has automatically terminated. The newly committed offense may, but\nneed not also be the subject of a separate non-judicial punishment\naction. (iii)\nA single offense\nshould be the basis for both vacation action and a new non-judicial punishment\naction only when the new offense warrants substantial additional punishment. Separate actions must be initiated in such event. (iv)\n\nIn a suitable case, the original\npunishment may be continued in a suspended status and a separate action\ncommenced and punishment imposed for the new offense. (See section\n520.2\n(c)(1)(iv)\nof this Part.)\n(v) A vacation of\nsuspension action must be in writing, and is commenced when the notification of\nintent to vacate (recommend vacation of) the suspension of punishment is mailed\nor delivered to the offender (DMNA form 1067 [Appendix L-2(A29)]). (vi)\n\nThe vacation action need not be entirely\ncompleted during the suspension period if during the suspension period the\noffender has been properly notified of the intent to vacate. Once the\nsuspension period has terminated, a vacation action can no longer be commenced\neven though based on the alleged commission of an offense before the suspension\nhas terminated. However, this offense may be the basis of a new non-judicial\npunishment action. (vii)\n\nThe\ncommencement of a vacation action automatically extends the suspension period\nuntil the vacation action is decided. (viii)\n\nThere is no right to appeal a vacation\naction; however, the offender has the right to submit matters in extenuation, mitigation or defense. (ix)\n\nThe\nvacation action will be processed in the same manner regarding legal\nsufficiency review by the unit JA and forwarded to the commander, NYANG as the\noriginal non-judicial punishment action. (2)\n\nNotification, certificates of mailing or\npersonal delivery, acknowledgments of receipt of notification of vacation\naction, vacation of suspension. (i) All\nprocedures in administering non-judicial punishment (section\n520.3\n(a) of this Part) except concerning appeal, shall be followed in vacation\naction. (ii)\n\nThe person authorized\nto vacate the suspension or the person recommending the vacation action, as the\ncase may be, must include the following in the notification: (a) the specific offenses alleged to have\nbeen committed, the time, date and place of commission and the statute\nallegedly violated; and\n(b) the\ndate and nature of the original punishment imposed, the person imposing it and\nfor what offense; and\n(c) the date\nand portion of the punishment suspended and the termination date of the\nsuspension; and\n(d) the intention\nto vacate the suspension or to recommend same, as the case may be; and\n(e) the right of the offender\nto submit any matter in extenuation, mitigation, and defense to the charges, but that the offender need not do so, since any statement made by him may be\nused as evidence against him in a further non- judicial punishment action, or\nin a trial by court-martial; and\n(f) the directions to acknowledge receipt of\nthe notification, by signing, dating and returning it within a specified period\n(usually at least 10 days from the date of mailing or delivery), and to decide\nwhether or not to submit matters in extenuation, etc. accompanied by any such\nmatters; and the statement that the action may nevertheless proceed if the\noffender fails to respond or submit matters within the required time. (iii)\n\nThe certificates of mailing\nor delivery of the notification of vacation action are the same in this action\nas in the original non-judicial punishment action. (iv)\n\nThe acknowledgment of receipt of\nnotification is the same as in the original non-judicial punishment\naction. (v) The suspension may not\nbe vacated until the earlier of the following three dates: the date specified\nin the notification for a response, the date the offender has actually\nresponded, or the date the notification is returned unclaimed, addressee\nunknown, etc. The vacation of suspension includes: (a) the same alternative statements as used\nfor the imposition of punishment (see section\n520.3\n[a][5][i]\n[ a] and [b] of this Part); and\n(b) the action taken, referring to the nature and date of the punishment imposed, and the execution date of the punishment; and\n(c) if a suspended reduction is being\nvacated, the new date of rank and new rank; and\n(d) the direction to acknowledge receipt of\nthe vacation action by dating, signing and returning it (DMNA form 1068\n[Appendix L-2(A30)]). (vi)\n\nThe vacation of suspension is effective\non the date of vacation. No reply from the offender is required to further\nexecute the punishment. The achnowledgement is further proof of the offender's\nnotification of the vacation. (vii)\n\nAt any time before the suspension is vacated, the person authorized to vacate, his successor-in-command, or superior authority may terminate the action\nwithout vacation under circumstances in accordance with procedures specified in\nsection\n520.4\n(a) of this Part. (See note 3 to DMNA form 1068 [Appendix L-(A30)]). (viii)\n\nIn determining whether to vacate a\nsuspension, the commander shall adhere to the same standard of proof and\nguidelines as in a non-judicial punishment action (see action 520.4[a][2] of\nthis Part).
