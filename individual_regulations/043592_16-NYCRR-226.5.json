  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 226.5 - Test-standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All meter\ntest-standards shall be of types approved by this commission in accordance with\n\nPart 227 of this Title or, if not required to be approved in accordance with\n\nPart 227, whose accuracy is traceable to the National Institute of Standards\nand Technology. Certification will be conducted by this commission, by its\ndesignee, or by commission approved procedures conducted with standards or\nequipment that trace their accuracy to the National Institute of Standards and\n\nTechnology. (b) Test-standard\ncertification frequency. (1)\n\nBell provers\nshall be certified initially and at least once every two years. (2)\n\nTransfer provers shall be certified\ninitially and at least once every two years. This certification requirement may\nbe extended to once every five years provided that an annual comparison test\nbetween the transfer prover meter and a non-working reference standard agree to\nwithin +- 0.25 percent proof at no less than 16 points between 10 and 120\npercent of the rated capacity of the transfer prover. (3)\n\nSonic nozzle provers shall be certified\ninitially and at least once every two years. This certification requirement may\nbe extended to once every five years provided that an annual comparison test\nbetween the sonic nozzle prover and a nonworking reference standard agree to\nwithin +- 0.25 percent proof of the most recently certified sonic nozzle\ncalibration proof. (4)\nA\nnon-working reference standard meter shall be certified initially and at least\nonce every five years. Its accuracy should be established at no less than 16\npoints between 10 and 120 percent of its rated capacity. (5)\n\nTemperature and pressure test-standards\nshall be certified initially and at least once every five years. (6)\n\nAuxiliary equipment. Any type of\nauxiliary equipment connected to a test-standard shall be installed and tested\nin accordance with manufacturers' instructions or in a manner acceptable to the\ncommission or its designee. (c) Additional meter test-standard\nrequirements. (1)\n\nThe capacity of the meter\ntest-standard shall meet the open rate test requirements of the meter being\ntested. (2)\n\nEach certified meter\ntest-standard shall be provided with a certificate bearing the serial number, date of certification, correction factor(s) and test limitations, if\nany. (3)\n\nEach meter test-standard\nshall be recertified after being damaged, repaired, adjusted or disassembled\nwhere such could in any way affect its previous accuracy calibration. Also, each bell prover shall be recertified if moved. (4)\n\nOnly meter test-standards with an error\nof less than +- 0.25 percent shall be used without applying a correction\nfactor. (5)\n\nEach bell prover shall\nbe adjusted to a static pressure in the order of 1.5 inches of water column\nabove or below atmospheric pressure. (6)\n\nEach transfer prover or sonic nozzle\ntest-standard shall be adjusted to the same pressure and temperature or\ncorrected for any pressure and temperature difference between it and the meter\nunder test. (7)\n\nEach meter\ntest-standard shall be tested for connection-fitting tightness prior to its\nuse. (8)\nA nonvolatile sealing\nmedium meeting the applicable specifications of the American National Standards\n\nInstitute (ANSI) standard set forth in section\n227.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle shall be used in all bell provers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n226.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
