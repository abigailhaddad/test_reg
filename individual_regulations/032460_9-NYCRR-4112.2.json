  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4112.2 - Early closing events, stakes and futurities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In early closing events, stakes and\nfuturities no more than 12 horses on a half-mile track, or 16 horses on a track\nin excess of a half mile, in two tiers, allowing eight feet per horse, will be\nallowed to start in any dash or heat. Where there are more than 12 or 16\nhorses, as the case may be, declared in to start, the track conducting the\nevent must adopt one of the following methods to be stated before positions are\ndrawn. All elimination heats and the concluding heat must be programmed to be\nraced upon the same day or night unless published conditions provided\notherwise. (b) Division methods. (1)\n(i) In\nstakes and New York-sired events, the race may be divided into as many\ndivisions as necessary, each division racing one heat for the portion of the\npurse resulting from dividing the total purse (before allocation of starting\nfees) by the number of divisions and adding to each division the starting fees\npaid for each starter in such division. (ii)\n\nIn early closing events the race may be\ndivided by lot and at least 50 percent added to the advertised purse and raced\nin two divisions; each division racing for one half of the total increases\npurse as above provided. If three or more divisions are necessary, the track\nshall add an amount sufficient to allow each division to race for at least 75\npercent of the purse originally advertised. (2)\n\nThe race may be divided into two\ndivisions by lot and raced in two elimination heats with all money winners from\nboth heats competing in the final. Each division shall race one elimination\nheat for 20 percent of the total purse and the remainder of the purse shall be\ndistributed to the money winners in the final. (3)\n\nThe race may be divided by lot and raced\nin two divisions, each of which shall race two heats for 20 percent of the\npurse each heat. The heat winners from both divisions shall compete in a final\nheat for the remaining 20 percent of the purse which shall go to the\nwinner. (4)\n\nThe field may be\ndivided by lot into two divisions, the first division to race for 30 percent of\nthe purse, and the second division to race for 30 percent of the purse. The\nhorses qualifying in the first and second divisions shall race the third heat\nfor 30 percent of the purse. The race winner shall receive the remaining 10\npercent of the purse. If after the third heat no horse has won two heats, a\nfourth heat shall be raced by only the heat winner to determine the winners of\nthe race. (5)\n\nThe race may be\ndivided in two divisions by lot and raced in two elimination heats with the\nfirst four horses finishing in each heat competing in the final event. Each\ndivision shall race one elimination heat for 30 percent of the total purse and\nthe remainder of the purse shall be distributed to the money winners in the\nfinal event. (6)\n\nThe race may be\ndivided in such other method as set out in the conditions approved by the\ncommission. (7)\n\nIn the event there\nare more horses declared to start than can be accommodated by two qualifying\ndashes, there will be scheduled enough elimination dashes to take care of the\nexcess. The percent of the purse raced for in each elimination dash will be\ndetermined by dividing the number of elimination dashes into 60. The main event\nwill race for 40 percent of the purse. If there are two elimination dashes, the\nfirst four finishers in each dash qualify for the final; if three or four\nelimination dashes, the first three horses in each dash qualify for the final; if five or six elimination dashes, the first two horses in each dash qualify\nfor the final.
