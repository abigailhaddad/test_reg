  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 613-4.4 - Reporting, investigation, and confirmation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reporting\nresponsibilities. The reporting requirements of subdivisions (b) and\n(e) of this section apply to the following persons: (1)\nthe facility owner; (2)\nthe tank system owner; (3)\nthe operator; (4)\nthe carrier; (5)\nany contractor in a contractual\nrelationship with the facility owner, tank system owner, or operator; (6)\nany other party and its contractors who\nhave been retained as part of a business transaction relating to the\nfacility; (7)\nany person who causes\na spill at the facility. (b) Reporting of suspected\nleaks. (1)\n\nSuspected leaks must be\nreported to the Department's Spill Hotline (800-457-7362) within two hours\nafter discovery and the procedures in subdivision (d) of this section must be\nfollowed for any of the following conditions: (i) the discovery of petroleum outside of an\nAST system at the facility or in the surrounding area (\ne.g., the presence of free product or vapors in soils, basements, sewer and utility\nlines, and nearby surface water); (ii)\nunusual operating conditions observed\n(\ne.g., the erratic behavior of petroleum dispensing equipment, the sudden loss of petroleum from the AST system, an unexplained presence of\nwater in the tank, or water in the interstitial space of secondarily contained\ntank system components), unless the tank system component is found to be\ndefective but not leaking, and is immediately repaired or replaced; or\n(iii)\ninspection/monitoring/testing results, including alarms, from an inspection or\nleak detection method required under subdivisions\n4.2\n(h)(1), and\n4.3(a) and (b) of this Subpart which indicate that a leak may have occurred, unless: (a) the monitoring device is found to\nbe defective, and is immediately repaired, recalibrated, or replaced, and\nadditional monitoring does not confirm the initial result; or\n(b) the alarm was investigated and determined\nto be a non-spill event (\ne.g., from a power surge or caused by\nfilling the tank during leak detection testing). (2)\n\nWhen a leak is suspected, or\nwhere inspections or tests required by this Part have not been performed, the\n\nDepartment may order the facility to inspect and to test the AST system or\nequipment for tightness and structural soundness. If the facility fails to\nconduct such inspections and tests within ten days after receipt of the\n\nDepartment's order, the Department may conduct inspections or tests for\ntightness. The expenses of conducting such tests as ordered by the Department\nmust be paid by the tank system owner. (c) Investigation due to off-site\nimpacts. When required by the Department, the procedures in\nsubdivision (d) of this section must be followed to determine if the AST system\nis the source of off-site impacts. These impacts include the discovery of\npetroleum (\ne.g., the presence of free product or vapors in\nsoils, basements, sewer and utility lines, and nearby surface and drinking\nwaters) that has been observed by the Department or brought to its attention by\nanother party. (d) Leak\ninvestigation and confirmation steps. Unless corrective action is\ninitiated in accordance with Subpart 7 of this Part, any leak or suspected leak\nof petroleum must be investigated using either one of the methods described in\nparagraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision or another procedure approved by the\n\nDepartment. The investigation must commence immediately following the reporting\nrequired under subdivision (b) or (e) of this section. The investigation must\nbe completed, and the results submitted to the Department prior to any repairs\nand within seven days after the reporting required under subdivision (b) or (e)\nof this section. (1)\n\nInspection or\nsystem test. An inspection or testing must be conducted in accordance\nwith paragraph 4.3(c)(1), (c)(2), or (d)(2) of this Subpart to determine: whether a leak exists in the portion of the AST system (including delivery\npiping) suspected of leaking; and, in the case of petroleum reaching secondary\ncontainment, if a breach of secondary containment occurred. (i) If the test results indicate that a leak\nor release has occurred, the leaking AST system must be immediately emptied to\nprevent further leaks and be: (a) promptly\ntaken out of service in accordance with subdivision 4.5(a) of this Subpart and\nrepaired in accordance with subdivision\n4.2\n(j) of this\n\nSubpart; (b) replaced; or\n(c) permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision 4.5(b) of this Subpart. (ii)\n\nIf the test results indicate that a\nrelease has occurred, corrective action must also begin in accordance with\n\nSubpart 7 of this Part. (iii)\n\nIf\nthe test results do not indicate that a leak exists but environmental\ncontamination is the basis for suspecting a leak, a site check must be\nconducted in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nIf the test results do not indicate that\na leak exists and if environmental contamination is not the basis for\nsuspecting a leak, further investigation is not required. (2)\n\nSite check. The presence\nor absence of a release must be measured where contamination is most likely to\nbe present at the facility. In selecting sample types, sample locations, and\nmeasurement methods, the following must also be considered: nature of the\ntype(s) of petroleum previously stored in the AST system; type of initial alarm\nor cause for suspicion; type of backfill; depth of groundwater; and other\nfactors appropriate for identifying the presence and source of the release. (i) If the site check results indicate that a\nrelease has occurred, corrective action must begin in accordance with Subpart 7\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nIf the site\ncheck results do not indicate that a release has occurred, further\ninvestigation is not required. (e) Response to spills. (1)\n\nReleases must be reported to the\n\nDepartment's Spill Hotline (800-457-7362) within two hours after discovery and\ncorrective action must begin in accordance with Subpart 7 of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nSpills must be contained\nand reported to the Department's Spill Hotline (800-457-7362) within two hours\nafter discovery and the procedures in subdivision (d) of this section must be\nfollowed, unless the spill meets all of the following conditions: (i) The spill is known to be less than five\ngallons in total volume. (ii)\n\nIt is\ncontained and under the control of the spiller. (iii)\n\nIt has not reached and will not reach\nthe lands or waters of the State. (iv)\n\nIt is cleaned up within two hours after\ndiscovery. (v) The component of the\nAST system (including delivery piping) that leaked is promptly repaired in\naccordance with subdivision\n4.2\n(j) of this\n\nSubpart or replaced. (3)\n\nLeaking AST systems must be immediately emptied to prevent further leaks and\nbe: (i) promptly taken out of service in\naccordance with subdivision 4.5(a) of this Subpart and repaired in accordance\nwith subdivision\n4.2\n(j) of this\n\nSubpart; (ii)\nreplaced; or\n(iii)\npermanently closed in\naccordance with subdivision 4.5(b) of this Subpart.
