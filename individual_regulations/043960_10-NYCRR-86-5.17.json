Tit. 10 §§ 86-5.17 - Allowable costs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To be considered as allowable in determining reimbursement rates, costs shall be properly chargeable to necessary patient care. Except as otherwise provided in this Subpart, or in accordance with specific determination by the commissioner, allowable costs shall be determined by the application of the principles of reimbursement developed for determining payments under title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Act (Medicare) program. (b) Allowable costs shall include a monetary value assigned to services provided by religious orders and for services rendered by an owner and operator of a LTHHCP. (c) Allowable costs shall not include amounts in excess of reasonable or maximum title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Act (Medicare) costs or in excess of customary charges to the general public. This provision shall not apply to services furnished by public providers free of charge or at a nominal fee. (d) Allowable costs shall not include expenses or portions of expenses reported by individual LTHHCP which are determined by the commissioner not to be reasonably related to the efficient production of long-term home health care services because of either the nature or the amount of the particular item.

(g) Allowable costs shall not include costs of contributions or other payments to political parties, candidates or organizations.
