Tit. 6 §§ 380-5.1 - Dose limits for individual members of the public\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each person subject to this Part must\nminimize the disposal and release of radioactive material to the environment so\nthat: (1)\nthe total effective dose equivalent\nto individual members of the public from the disposal or release does not\nexceed 0.1 rem (1 mSv) in a year, exclusive of the dose contributions from\nbackground radiation, from any medical administration the individual has\nreceived, from exposure to individuals administered radioactive material which\nhave been released in accordance with a license, from voluntary participation\nin medical research programs, and from the licensee's disposal of material into\nsanitary sewerage in accordance with section\n380-4.2\nof this Part; (2)\nthe dose in any unrestricted area in the\nenvironment from external sources does not exceed 0.002 rem (0.02 mSv) in any\none hour; and\n(3)\ndoses to\nindividual members of the public are ALARA. (b) Constraint on airborne emissions. To implement the ALARA requirements of section\n380-7.2\nof this Part, and\nnotwithstanding the requirements in this section, a constraint on airborne\nemissions of radioactive material to the environment, excluding radon-222 and\nits decay products, must be established by permittees such that the individual\nmember of the public likely to receive the highest dose will not be expected to\nreceive a total effective dose equivalent in excess of 10 mrem (0.1 mSv) per\nyear from these emissions. If a permittee subject to this requirement exceeds\nthis dose constraint, the permittee must report the exceedance as provided in\n\nSubpart 380-9 of this Part and promptly take appropriate corrective action to\nensure against recurrence. (c) If a licensee allows members of the\npublic to have access to restricted areas in the environment (i.e., outdoors), the limits for members of the public continue to apply to those\nindividuals. (d) The Department may\nimpose additional restrictions on radiation levels in unrestricted areas in the\nenvironment and on the total quantity of radionuclides that may be disposed of\nor released in effluents in order to restrict collective dose.
