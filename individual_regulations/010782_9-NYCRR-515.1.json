  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.1 - Persons subject to the new york state military law\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Introduction. All forces of the organized\nmilitia of New York State including the Army National Guard, the Air National\n\nGuard, the Naval Militia, the New York Guard and such additional forces as may\nbe created by the Governor are subject to the jurisdiction of the New York\n\nState Military Law. It should be noted that when members of the organized\nmilitia are ordered to Federal active duty pursuant to  title 10, United States Code, section\n672\nand when New York Army National Guard or Air National Guard\nunits deploy OCONUS on title 10 orders they are also concurrently subject to\nthe provisions and jurisdiction of the Federal Uniform Code of Military Justice\n(UCMJ). Therefore, members serving on inactive duty training (IDT) (drills)\nunder title 32, section 502, or annual training (AT) under title 32, section\n503, or on Federal training duty (FTTD) under title 32, or while on\nadministrative duty, attending administrative nights or an additional training\ndays, whether paid or unpaid, or on state active duty (SAD) are all subject to\nthe New York State Military Law. (b) The code of military justice. Part of the\n\nNew York State Military Law includes article 7, The Code of Military Justice. Contained in the Code of Military Justice are the punitive articles (sections\n130.73 to 130.115) which are generally offenses of a military nature. (See\n\nPart 518 of this manual). However, since the members are also subject to the\npenal laws of the State of New York or of the state in which they are\nperforming duty, the punitive articles in the State Code of Military Justice do\nnot contain the more serious offenses such as murder, manslaughter, robbery, burglary, rape, sodomy, etc. Such offenses should be referred to the police\nwhere the offense occurred. The state where the offense occurred or the United\n\nStates Government may exercise jurisdiction over these or other offenses not\ncovered in the New York State Military Law. While the New York State Code of\n\nMilitary Justice and this Chapter are patterned after the Uniform Code of\n\nMilitary Justice, 1983 and the Manual for Courts Martial--United States, 1984\nrespectively, the state code and rules are tailored to be more practical for a\nlargely part-time force. In order that commanders, judge advocates and members\nof the organized militia be familiar with the forms and procedures utilized\nunder the Federal active duty system, the forms and procedures utilized to\nprocess a state court-martial are the same forms utilized by the active\nservices, as modified for State use. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n515.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
