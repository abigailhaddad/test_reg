  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2504.4 - Grounds for refusal to renew lease and proceed for eviction\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe landlord shall not be required to offer a renewal\nlease to a tenant, and may maintain an action or proceeding to recover\npossession in a court of competent jurisdiction only upon one or more of the\nfollowing grounds: (a) Occupancy by\nowner or immediate family. (1)\n\nAn owner, who\nis a natural person and demonstrates an immediate and compelling need to\nrecover possession of a housing accommodation for their own personal use and\noccupancy of their residence or for the personal use and occupancy of their\nimmediate family as a primary residence. (2)\n\nThe provisions of this subdivision shall\nnot apply where a member of the household is 62 years of age or older, or has\nbeen a tenant in a housing accommodation in that building for 15 years or more, or has an impairment which results from anatomical, physiological or\npsychological conditions, other than addiction to alcohol, gambling, or any\ncontrolled substance, which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical\nand laboratory diagnostic techniques, and which are expected to be permanent\nand which prevent such person from engaging in any substantial gainful\nemployment. (3)\n\nThe provisions of\nthis subdivision shall only permit one of the individual owners of any building\nto recover possession of only one dwelling unit for personal use and\noccupancy. (4)\n\nNo action or\nproceeding to recover possession pursuant to this subdivision shall be\ncommenced in court unless and until the owner shall have made application to\nthe division and the division has issued an order permitting the owner to\ncommence such action or proceeding in court and, in addition, where such order\nis subject to certain conditions and terms, until such conditions and terms\nhave been complied with. (b) Withdrawal from the rental market. The\nowner has established, upon application on the prescribed form, to the\nsatisfaction of the division after a hearing and under such conditions and\nterms as the division may set that he seeks in good faith to withdraw occupied\ndwelling units from both the housing and nonhousing rental markets, without any\nintent to rent or sell all or any part of the land or structure. (c) Other grounds. The owner has established\nupon an application on the prescribed form, after a hearing and under such\nconditions and terms as the division may determine to be warranted that the\nrequested removal or eviction of the tenant is not inconsistent with the\npurposes of the act or this Chapter and would not be likely to result in the\ncircumvention or evasion thereof. No action or proceeding to recover possession\nshall be commenced in court by the owner where he is proceeding under\nsubdivision (b) or (c) of this section, until the owner has made application to\nthe division and the division has issued an order permitting the owner to\ncommence such action or proceeding in court and, in addition, where the order\nof the division is subject to the owner complying with specified conditions and\nterms, that the said conditions and terms have been complied with. (d) Primary residence. The housing\naccommodation is not occupied by the tenant, not including subtenants or\noccupants, as his or her primary residence, as determined by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction. A tenant who is a victim of domestic violence, as\ndefined in section\nfour hundred\nfifty-nine-a\nof the Social Services Law, who has left\nthe unit because of such violence, and who asserts an intent to return to the\nhousing accommodation shall be deemed to be occupying the unit as his or her\nprimary residence. In addition, a tenant who has left the housing accommodation\nand is paying a nominal rent pursuant to Part 2500.9 (e)(7) of this Title shall\nbe deemed to be occupying the unit as his or her primary residence. For the\npurposes of this Section, where a housing accommodation is rented to a\nnot-for-profit for providing, as of and after the effective date of the chapter\nof the laws of two thousand nineteen that amended this Section, permanent\nhousing to individuals who are or were homeless or at risk of homelessness, affiliated individuals authorized to use such accommodations by such\nnot-for-profit shall be deemed to be tenants. (e) Election not to renew. Once an\napplication is filed under this section, with notification to all affected\ntenants pursuant to section\n2504.3\nof this Part, the owner may\nrefuse to renew all tenants' leases until a determination of the owner's\napplication is made by the division. For the purposes of subdivisions (b), (c)\nand (f) of this section, service of the application at any time shall be\nconsidered sufficient compliance with section\n2504.3\nof this part provided that\nno order may be issued less than 90 days from the date the last affected\ntenant's lease has expired. If such application is denied, or withdrawn, prospective renewal leases must be offered to all affected tenants within such\ntime and at such guidelines rates as directed in the division's order of denial\nor withdrawal. (f) Demolition. (1)\n\nThe owner seeks in good faith to demolish\nthe building. As part of the application, the owner shall submit proof of its\nfinancial ability to complete such undertaking to the division, and that the\nplans for the undertaking have been approved by the appropriate governmental\nagency. Demolition shall mean the removal of the entire building including the\nfoundation. (2)\n\nTerms and\nconditions upon which orders issued pursuant to this paragraph authorizing\nrefusal to offer renewal leases may be based: (i) The division shall require an owner to\npay all reasonable moving expenses and a stipend pursuant to clause (c) of\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. It shall afford the tenant a reasonable\nperiod of time within which to vacate the housing accommodation. If the tenant\nvacates the housing accommodation on or before the date provided in the\ndivision's final order, such tenant shall be entitled to receive moving\nexpenses and all stipend benefits pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. In addition, if the tenant vacates the housing accommodation prior\nto the required vacate date, the owner may also pay a stipend to the tenant\nthat is larger than the stipend designated in clause (c) of subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph. However, at no time shall an owner be required to pay a\nstipend in excess of this amount. If the tenant does not vacate the housing\naccommodation on or before the required vacate date, the stipend shall be\nreduced by one-sixth of the total stipend for each month the tenant remains in\noccupancy after such vacate date except if the eviction is stayed by the\ncommencement of judicial review of DHCR's order including any\nappeals. (ii)\n\nThe order granting\nthe owner's demolition application shall provide that the owner must either: (a) relocate the tenant to a suitable housing\naccommodation, as defined in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, at the same or\nlower legal regulated rent in a closely proximate area, or in a new residential\nbuilding if constructed on the site, in which case suitable interim housing\nshall be provided at no additional cost to the tenant; plus in addition to\nreasonable moving expenses, payment of a $5,000 stipend, provided the tenant\nvacates on or before the vacate date required by the final order; (b) where an owner provides relocation of the\ntenant to a suitable housing accommodation at a rent in excess of that for the\nsubject housing accommodation, in addition to the tenant's reasonable moving\nexpenses, the owner may be required to pay the tenant a stipend equal to the\ndifference in rent, at the commencement of the occupancy by the tenant of the\nnew housing accommodation, between the subject housing accommodation and the\nhousing accommodation to which the tenant is relocated, multiplied by 72\nmonths, provided the tenant vacates before the vacate date required by the\nfinal order; or\n(c) In addition to\nthe tenant's moving expenses, pay the tenant a stipend which shall be the\ndifference between the tenant's current rent and the average rent for vacant\nnon-regulated apartments as set forth in the New York City Housing and Vacancy\n\nSurvey as of the date of the determination, or such other data that may be made\navailable to the division. This difference is to be multiplied by seventy-two\nmonths. This stipend shall be increased each year by a guideline beginning the\nfirst year after the vacancy survey is issued and continuing until a new\nvacancy survey is issued. (iii)\n\nWherever a stipend would result in the\ntenant losing a subsidy or other governmental benefit which is income\ndependent, the tenant may elect to waive the stipend and have the owner at his\nor her own expense, relocate the tenant to a suitable housing accommodation at\nthe same or lower legal regulated rent in a closely proximate area. (iv)\n\nIn the event that the tenant dies prior\nto the issuance by the division of a final order granting the owner's\napplication, the owner shall not be required to pay such stipend to the estate\nof the deceased tenant. (v) Where\nthe administrator's or commissioner's order granting the owner's application is\nconditioned upon the owner's compliance with specified terms and conditions, if\nsuch terms and conditions have not been complied with, or if the division\ndetermines that the owner has not proceeded in good faith, the order may be\nmodified or revoked. (vi)\n\nNoncompliance by the owner with any term or condition of the administrator's or\ncommissioner's order granting the owner's application may result in the\ndivision initiating its own enforcement proceeding. The division shall retain\njurisdiction for this purpose until all of the terms and conditions in the\nadministrator's or commissioner's order granting the owner's application have\nbeen met and the project described in the owner's application has been\ncompleted. Subsequent owners shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the\ndivision's order. This subparagraph shall not be deemed to eliminate any remedy\nor claim that a tenant of the dwelling unit may otherwise have against the\nowner nor eliminate any independent authority that the division may be able to\nexercise by law or regulation. (vii)\n\nAn owner's failure to comply within a\nreasonable amount of time with any term or condition of the administrator's or\ncommissioner's order granting the owner's application or an owner's failure to\ncomplete the project described in the owner's application may be found to be a\nviolation of the ETPA and these regulations and subject the owner to any of the\npenalties and remedies described therein including but not limited to\nrevocation of the administrator's or commissioner's order granting the owner's\napplication and the division's continued jurisdiction under the ETPA over the\nbuilding or any subsequent construction. Any remedies and penalties prescribed\nby these regulations shall apply to and be binding against subsequent\nowners. (3)\n\nComparable\nhousing accommodations and relocation. In the event a comparable housing\naccommodation is offered by the owner, a tenant may file an objection with the\ndivision challenging the suitability of an housing accommodation offered by the\nowner for relocation within 10 days after the owner identifies the housing\naccommodation and makes it available for the tenant to inspect and consider the\nsuitability thereof. Within 30 days thereafter, the division shall inspect the\nhousing accommodation, on notice to both parties, in order to determine whether\nthe offered housing accommodation is suitable. Such determination will be made\nby the division as promptly as practicable thereafter. In the event that the\ndivision determines that the housing accommodation is not suitable, the tenant\nshall be offered another housing accommodation, and shall have 10 days after it\nis made available by the owner for the tenant's inspection to consider its\nsuitability. In the event that the division determines that the housing\naccommodation is suitable, the tenant shall have 15 days thereafter within\nwhich to accept the housing accommodation. A tenant who refuses to accept\nrelocation to any housing accommodation determined by the division to be\nsuitable shall lose the right to relocation by the owner, and to receive\npayment of moving expenses or any stipend. Suitable housing accommodations\nshall mean housing accommodations which are similar in size and features to the\nrespective housing accommodations now occupied by the tenants. Such housing\naccommodations shall be freshly painted before the tenant takes occupancy, and\nshall be provided with substantially the same required services and equipment\nthe tenants received in their prior housing accommodations. The building\ncontaining such housing accommodations shall be free from violations of law\nrecorded by the governmental agency having jurisdiction, which constitute fire\nhazards or conditions dangerous or detrimental to life or health, or which\naffect the maintenance of required services. The division will consider housing\naccommodations proposed for relocation which are not presently subject to rent\nregulation, provided the owner submits a contractual agreement that places the\ntenant in a substantially similar housing accommodation at no additional rent\nfor a period of six years, unless the tenant requests a shorter lease period in\nwriting.
