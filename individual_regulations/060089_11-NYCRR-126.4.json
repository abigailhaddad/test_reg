Tit. 11 § 126.4 - Permitted conditions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The trust agreement may provide that the trustee may resign upon delivery of a written notice of resignation, effective not less than 90 days after receipt by the beneficiary and grantor of the notice and that the trustee may be removed by the grantor by delivery to the trustee and the beneficiary of a written notice of removal, effective not less than 90 days after receipt by the trustee and the beneficiary of the notice, provided that no such resignation or removal shall be effective until a successor trustee has been duly appointed and approved by the beneficiary and the grantor and all assets in the trust have been duly transferred to the new trustee. (b) The grantor may have the full and unqualified right to vote any shares of stock in the trust account and to receive from time to time payments of any dividends or interest upon any shares of stock or obligations included in the trust account. Any such interest or dividends shall be either forwarded promptly upon receipt to the grantor or deposited in a separate account established in the grantor's name. (c) The trustee may be given authority to invest and accept substitutions of any funds in the account, provided that no such investment or substitution shall be made without prior approval of the beneficiary, unless the trust agreement specifies categories of investments acceptable to the beneficiary and authorizes the trustee to invest such funds and to accept such substitutions which the trustee determines are at least equal in market value to the assets withdrawn. Such categories shall be consistent with the restrictions in section\n126.5\n(a)(2)\nof this Part. (d) The trust agreement may provide that the beneficiary may at any time designate a party to which all or part of the trust assets are to be transferred. Such transfer may be conditioned upon the trustee receiving, simultaneously, other specified assets. (e) The trust agreement may provide that, upon termination of the trust account, all assets not previously withdrawn by the beneficiary shall, with written approval by the beneficiary, be delivered over to the grantor.
