Tit. 1§ 1.2 - Approval of laboratories\n\nState Regulations\n\nAny person who desires to have his laboratory approved by\nthe commissioner for determining the vitamin D level in milk samples taken\nunder the supervision of the commissioner, as herein provided, shall first\nsatisfy the commissioner that tests to be made in such laboratory will be\nconducted by persons qualified by training, experience and facilities to make\nsuch tests accurately. Laboratories operated and maintained by those persons\nwho thus satisfy the commissioner shall be designated \"Approved\n\nLaboratories\". For the purpose of determining whether or not a laboratory\nshall be designated as an \"approved laboratory\" the commissioner may designate\na qualified person or persons to examine the laboratory, its equipment, facilities and personnel, at the expense of the applying laboratory, and\nthereafter may have similar examinations made at the expense of the applying\nlaboratory for the purpose of determining whether or not such approval should\nbe continued. The approval of a laboratory for determining the vitamin D\nlevel in milk may be withdrawn by the commissioner if he is satisfied that the\nlaboratory, its facilities or personnel are not suitable for making accurate\ndeterminations of the vitamin D level of milk.
