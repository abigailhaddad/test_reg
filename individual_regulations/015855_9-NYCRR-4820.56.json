In either case, the percentage of sales to be awarded for each color, or the dollar amount of\nthe fixed prize to be awarded for each color, shall be listed on both the\norganization's application for license and the bingo program. (c) The dollar amount of the prize to be\nawarded in each color category shall be announced prior to the calling of the\nfirst number in each tri-color game.
