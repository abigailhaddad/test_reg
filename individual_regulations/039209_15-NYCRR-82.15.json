(2)\n\nTranscripts\ncan only be obtained from the agency which holds the contract for the\ntranscription of hearings held by the Department of Motor Vehicles. The cost of\nsuch transcript, which is payable by the appellant, shall be the price for such\ntranscripts as contained in the contract between the department and the\nindependent contractor. (3)\nA\ntranscript will be considered to have been submitted in timely fashion if it is\nphysically submitted to the review board, or if proof that the transcript has\nbeen ordered is submitted to the review board not later than 60 days from the\ndate after written notice was given of the determination appealed from or 30\ndays after the board has mailed an acknowledgment of receipt of the appeal with\ninstructions for ordering the transcript, whichever is later, excluding the\ndate of determination.

If the registrant\nappeals only from a determination made with respect to his repair shop\nregistration, he shall be entitled to review as provided in this Part; however, if he appeals from any determination or determinations made with respect to any\nother license or registration, as well as a determination with respect to his\nrepair shop registration, the appeals procedure established in article 3-A of\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law shall be followed in lieu of the procedure\nestablished in this Part.
