(j) Standards: delay of\nrepair. (1)\n\nDelay of repair of\nequipment for which leaks have been detected will be allowed if the repair is\ntechnically infeasible without a hazardous waste management unit shutdown. In\nsuch a case, repair of this equipment shall occur before the end of the next\nhazardous waste management unit shutdown. (2)\n\nDelay of repair of equipment for which\nleaks have been detected will be allowed for equipment that is isolated from\nthe hazardous waste management unit and that does not continue to contain or\ncontact hazardous waste with organic concentrations at least 10 percent by\nweight. (3)\n\nDelay of repair for\nvalves will be allowed if: (i) the owner or\noperator determines that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate\nrepair are greater than the emissions likely to result from delay of repair; and\n(ii)\nwhen repair procedures are\neffected, the purged material is collected and destroyed or recovered in a\ncontrol device complying with subdivision (k) of this section.

Delay of repair beyond the next hazardous waste management unit\nshutdown will not be allowed unless the next hazardous waste management unit\nshutdown occurs sooner than six months after the first hazardous waste\nmanagement unit shutdown. (k) Standards: closed-vent systems and\ncontrol devices. (1)\n\nOwners or\noperators of closed-vent systems and control devices subject to this section\nshall comply with the provisions of section\n373-3.27\n(d) of\nthis Subpart. (2)\n(i) The owner or operator of an existing\nfacility who cannot install a closed-vent system and control device to comply\nwith the provisions of this section on the effective date that the facility\nbecomes subject to the provisions of this section must prepare an\nimplementation schedule that includes dates by which the closed-vent system and\ncontrol device will be installed and in operation. The controls must be\ninstalled as soon as possible, but the implementation schedule may allow up 30\nmonths after the effective date that the facility becomes subject to this\nsection for installation and startup. (ii)\n\nAny unit that begins operation after\n\nDecember 21, 1990, and is subject to the requirements of this section when\noperation begins, must comply with the rules immediately\n(\ni.e., must have control devices installed and operating on\nstartup of the affected unit); the 30-month implementation schedule does not\napply. (iii)\n(a) If an existing facility is already\nsubject to\n40 CFR\n264.1033(a)(2)(iii)\nat the\ntime a State statutory or regulatory amendment renders the facility subject to\nthis section, the requirements established under\n40 CFR\n264.1033(a)(2)(iii), as\nincorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title, will\napply. (b) If an existing facility\nis not subject to\n40 CFR\n264.1033(a)(2)(iii)\nat the\ntime a State statutory or regulatory amendment renders the facility subject to\nthis section, the owner or operator of the facility in existence on the\neffective date of the State statutory or regulatory amendment that renders the\nfacility subject to this section shall comply with all requirements of this\nsection as soon as practicable but no later than 30 months after the State\namendment's effective date. When control equipment required by the section\ncannot be installed and begin operation by the effective date of the amendment, the facility owner or operator shall prepare an implementation schedule that\nincludes the following information: specific calendar dates for award of\ncontracts or issuance of purchase orders for the control equipment, initiation\nof on-site istallation of the control equipment, completion of the control\nequipment installation, and performance of any testing to demonstrate that the\ninstalled equipment meets the applicable standards of this section. The owner\nor operator shall enter the implementation schedule in the operating record or\nin a permanent, readily available file located at the facility. (iv)\n\nOwners and operators of\nfacilities and units that become newly subject to the requirements of this\nsection after December 8, 1997 due to an action other than those described in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph must comply with all applicable\nrequirements immediately (\ni.e., must have control devices\ninstalled and operating on the date the facility or unit becomes subject to\nthis section; the 30-month implementation schedule does not apply). (l) Alternative\nstandards for valves in gas/vapor service or in light liquid service: percentage of valves allowed to leak. (1)\n\nAn owner or operator subject to the\nrequirements of subdivision (h) of this section may elect to have all valves\nwithin a hazardous waste management unit comply with an alternative standard\nwhich allows no greater than two percent of the valves to leak. (2)\n\nThe following requirements shall be met\nif an owner or operator elects to comply with the alternative standard of\nallowing two percent of valves to leak: (i) A\nperformance test as specified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall be\nconducted initially upon designation, annually, and at other times requested by\nthe department. (ii)\n\nIf a valve\nleak is detected, it shall be repaired in accordance with paragraphs (h)(4) and\n(5) of this section. (3)\n\nPerformance tests shall be conducted in the following manner: (i) All valves subject to the requirements in\nsubdivision (h) of this section within the hazardous waste management unit\nshall be monitored within one week by the methods specified in paragraph (n)(2)\nof this section. (ii)\n\nIf an\ninstrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured, a leak is\ndetected. (iii)\n\nThe leak percentage\nshall be determined by dividing the number of valves subject to the\nrequirements in subdivision (h) of this section for which leaks are detected by\nthe total number of valves subject to the requirements in subdivision (h) of\nthis section within the hazardous waste management unit. (m) Alternative standards\nfor valves in gas/vapor service or in light liquid service: skip period leak\ndetection and repair. (1)\n\nAn owner\nor operator subject to the requirements of subdivision (h) of this section may\nelect for all valves within a hazardous waste management unit to comply with\none of the alternative work practices specified in subparagraphs (2)(ii) and\n(iii) of this subdivision. (2)\n(i) An owner or operator shall comply with\nthe requirements for valves, as described in subdivision (h) of this section, except as described in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nAfter two\nconsecutive quarterly leak detection periods with the percentage of valves\nleaking equal to or less than two percent, an owner or operator may begin to\nskip one of the quarterly leak detection periods (\ni.e., monitor for leaks once every six months) for the valves subject to the\nrequirements in subdivision (h) of this section. (iii)\n\nAfter five consecutive quarterly leak\ndetection periods with the percentage of valves leaking equal to or less than\ntwo percent, an owner or operator may begin to skip three of the quarterly leak\ndetection periods (\ni.e., monitor for leaks once every year)\nfor the valves subject to the requirements in subdivision (h) of this\nsection. (iv)\n\nIf the percentage of\nvalves leaking is greater than two percent, the owner or operator shall monitor\nmonthly in compliance with the requirements in subdivision (h) of this section, but may again elect to use this subdivision after meeting the requirements of\nsubparagraph (h)(3)(i) of this section. (n) Test methods and procedures. (1)\n\nEach owner operator subject to the\nprovisions of this section shall comply with the test methods and procedures\nrequirements provided in this subdivision. (2)\n\nLeak detection monitoring, as required in\nsubdivisions (c) through (m) of this section, shall comply with the following\nrequirements: (i) Monitoring shall comply\nwith Reference Method 21 in 40 CFR part\n60\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (ii)\n\nThe detection\ninstrument shall meet the performance criteria of Reference Method\n21. (iii)\n\nThe instrument shall be\ncalibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in\n\nReference Method 21. (iv)\n\nCalibration gases shall be: (a) zero air\n(less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); or\n(b) a mixture of methane or n-hexane and air\nat a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppm methane or\nn-hexane. (v) The\ninstrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as\nclose to the interface as possible as described in Reference Method\n21. (3)\n\nWhen equipment\nis tested for compliance with no detectable emissions, as required in\nparagraphs (c)(5) and (d)(9), subdivision (e), and paragraph (h)(6) of this\nsection, the test shall comply with the following requirements: (i) The requirements of subparagraphs (2)(i)\nthrough (iv) of this subdivision shall apply. (ii)\n\nThe background level shall be\ndetermined, as set forth in Reference Method 21. (iii)\n\nThe instrument probe shall be traversed\naround all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as\ndescribed in Reference Method 21. (iv)\n\nThe arithmetic difference between the\nmaximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level is\ncompared with 500 ppm for determining compliance. (4)\n\nIn accordance with the waste analysis\nplan required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an owner or operator of a\nfacility must determine, for each piece of equipment, whether the equipment\ncontains or contacts a hazardous waste with organic concentration that equals\nor exceeds 10 percent by weight using the following: (i) methods described in ASTM Methods D 4420, E 169, E 168, E 260 (incorporated by reference under section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); (ii)\n\nMethod 9060A of SW-846\n(incorporated by reference under section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) or analyzed for its individual organic constituents; or\n(iii)\napplication of the knowledge of the\nnature of the hazardous waste stream or the process by which it was produced. Documentation of a waste determination by knowledge is required. Examples of\ndocumentation that shall be used to support a determination under this\nprovision include production process information documenting that no organic\ncompounds are used, information that the waste is generated by a process that\nis identical to a process at the same or another facility that has previously\nbeen demonstrated by direct measurement to have a total organic content less\nthan 10 percent, or prior speciation analysis results on the same waste stream\nwhere it can also be documented that no process changes have occurred since\nthat analysis that could affect the waste total organic\nconcentration. (5)\n\nIf an\nowner or operator determines that a piece of equipment contains or contacts a\nhazardous waste with organic concentrations at least 10 percent by weight, the\ndetermination can be revised only after following the procedures in\nsubparagraph (4)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nWhen an owner or operator and the\ncommissioner do not agree on whether a piece of equipment contains or contacts\na hazardous waste with organic concentrations of at least 10 percent by weight, the procedures in subparagraph (4)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision can be used\nto resolve the dispute. (7)\n\nSamples\nused in determining the percent organic content shall be representative of the\nhighest total organic content hazardous waste that is expected to be contained\nin or contact the equipment. (8)\n\nTo\ndetermine if pumps or valves are in light liquid service, the vapor pressures\nof constituents may be obtained from standard reference texts or may be\ndetermined by ASTM D-2879 (incorporated by reference under section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (9)\n\nPerformance tests to\ndetermine if a control device achieves 95 weight percent organic emission\nreduction shall comply with the procedures of section\n373-3.27\n(e)(3)(i) through\n(iv)\nof this Subpart.
