  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10, app 75-A § 75-A.10 - Other systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Holding Tanks. The use of holding tanks shall not be permitted for new home construction except where occupancy of a home is permitted while the sewage treatment system is under construction. Tank size shall be based upon five days design flow or 1,000 gallons, whichever is greater and meet the same construction as a septic tank except that the holding tank shall not have an outlet. Holding tanks are not acceptable for long term use on year-round residences. (b) Non-Waterborne Systems. (1)\n\nGeneral. In certain areas of the State where running water is not available or is too scarce to economically support flush toilets, or where there is a need or desire to conserve water, the installation of non-waterborne sewage systems may be considered however, the treatment of wastewater from sinks, showers, and other facilities must be provided when non-flush toilets are installed. Household wastewater without toilet wastes is known as greywater. (2)\n\nComposters. These units shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturers instructions. The units shall have a label indicating compliance with the requirements of National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) Standard 41 or equivalent. Only units with a warranty of five years or more shall be installed. (3)\n\nChemical and Recirculating Toilets. (i) Chemical toilets provide a toilet seat located directly above a vault containing chemicals to disinfect and remove odors from the wastewater. Recirculating toilets use chemicals as the toilet flush fluid. The wastes are separated from the fluid, wastes discharged to an internal holding tank, and the fluid reused. (ii)\n\nThe liquids used in these types of toilets do not completely disinfect the wastes; therefore, waste products from these units shall not be discharged to surface waters or to the ground surface. (iii)\n\nThe reduced volume wastewater from recirculating toilets may be discharged to a larger holding tank but not to a subsurface absorption system. (4)\n\nIncinerator Toilets. These units accept human waste into a chamber where the wastes are burned. They have a very limited capacity and require a source of electricity or gas. The ash remains must be periodically removed. They must be installed according to the manufacturer's instructions. (5)\n\nGreywater Systems. Greywater systems shall be designed upon a flow of 75 gpd/bedroom and meet all the criteria previously discussed for treatment of household wastewater. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
