Tit. 19 § 150.8 - Filing date\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe date of filing of a certificate or other instrument\nsubmitted to the Division of Corporations for filing shall be the date the\ncertificate or other instrument is received by the Division as determined by\nthe Division. If a certificate or other instrument is determined by the\n\nDivision to be unacceptable for filing, the Division may return the certificate\nor other instrument to the filer, together with a brief written explanation of\nthe reason for the refusal to file. If the filer returns the certificate or\nother instrument to the Division with revisions within 30 days after it was\nmailed or otherwise returned to the filer by the Division and the Division\ndetermines the certificate or other instrument is acceptable for filing, the\nfiling date of the instrument will be the filing date that would have been\napplied had the original certificate or other instrument not been deficient. Revisions to the certificate or other instrument shall be limited to the reason\nfor the Division's refusal to file the certificate or other instrument. If a certificate or other instrument which has previously\nbeen determined by the Division to be unacceptable for filing is returned to\nthe Division with revisions within the time required by this section and the\n\nDivision again determines the certificate or other instrument to be\nunacceptable for filing, the Division may return the certificate or other\ninstrument to the filer, together with a brief written explanation of the\nreason for the refusal to file. If the filer subsequently returns the\ncertificate or other instrument to the Division with revisions in accordance\nwith the rules of the Division within 30 days after it was last mailed or\notherwise returned to the filer by the Division, and the Division determines\nthe certificate or other instrument is acceptable for filing, the filing date\nof the certificate or other instrument will be the filing date that would have\nbeen applied had the original certificate or other instrument not been\ndeficient. Revisions to the certificate or other instrument shall be limited to\nthe reason for the Division's refusal to file the certificate or other\ninstrument. This procedure may continue until the certificate or other\ninstrument is either accepted for filing by the Division or the filer does not\nreturn the certificate or other instrument to the Division within the time\nperiod required by this section.
