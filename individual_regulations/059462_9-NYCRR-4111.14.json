Tit. 9 § 4111.14 - Declarations-omissions, deletions, errors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Once drawn, post positions in stakes or early and late closing events shall be\nfinal, unless there is evidence satisfactory to the presiding judge that a\nhorse was properly declared and has been omitted from the race through the\nerror of either the track or its agent or employee. In such event, if the error\nis discovered prior to scratch time or the printing of the program, whichever\nis sooner, the horse shall be added to the race, and post positions therefore\nshall be redrawn. If such race has been divided however, the additional horse\nshall be added to the division determined by the presiding judge and only the\npost positions in such division shall be redrawn. (b) The provisions of this rule shall not\napply to overnight events. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
