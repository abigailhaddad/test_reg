  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8-2.1 - Apportionment of surcharge base to the MCTD\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 209-B)\n(a) A surcharge taxpayer must apportion its\nsurcharge base by multiplying such surcharge base by its MCTD apportionment\npercentage. The surcharge taxpayer's MCTD apportionment percentage is computed\nusing a formula consisting of three factors, expressed as percentages. The\nthree factors are: (1)\nreal and tangible\npersonal property that is located within the MCTD and all such property that is\nlocated in New York State, including real and tangible personal property that\nis rented to the surcharge taxpayer; (2)\nbusiness receipts from within the MCTD\nand all business receipts from New York State; and\n(3)\npayroll within the MCTD and all payroll\nfrom New York State. (b) The MCTD apportionment percentage is computed by adding together the surcharge\ntaxpayer's real and tangible personal property factor, business receipts factor\nand payroll factor, and dividing by three. If a factor is missing, the other\ntwo factors will be added together and the total divided by two. If two factors\nare missing, the remaining factor is the MCTD apportionment percentage. A\nfactor is missing only if both the numerator and the denominator are\nzero. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n8-2.1\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
