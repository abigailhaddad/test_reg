  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 223.6 - Procedures and responsibility for calibrating cherry holding tanks for volumetric measurement\n\nState Regulations\n\nProcedures and responsibility for calibrating cherry holding\ntanks for volumetric measurement shall be as follows: (a) Equipment required: (1)\n\nLevel surface, preferably a cement\nslab. (2)\n\nStand of a size and type\nto hold test measure full of water in a level position above tanks being\ncalibrated. (3)\n\nMeasuring rod of\nthe type approved for the commercial measurement of red tart cherries, or its\nequal. (4)\n\nTest measure, preferably\nsix cubic foot test measure or 50 gallon test measure with adjustable legs, bottom-opening \"quick-closing\" valve. Test measure will be calibrated and\ncertified to New York State standards. (5)\n\nLevel: a sensitive level three to four\nfeet long for leveling tanks. (6)\n\nAngle iron: a three inch angle iron long enough to bridge tank (approximately\n38 inches long) to suspend measuring rod. (7)\n\"C\" clamps: large enough to clamp angle\niron. (b) Calibration of\ntank. (1)\n\nPlace holding tank on level surface\ndirectly under the outlet valve of test measure. (2)\n\nSecure angle iron and measuring rod to\ntop of tank so the measuring rod is directly over the center of the\ntank. (3)\n\nLevel the holding\ntank. (4)\n\nRead and record the\nreading on the measuring rod with the rod extended to the bottom of the\ntank. (5)\n\nFill test measure with\nwater. (6)\n\nDischarge water from\ntest measure into holding tank. Let test measure drain 30 seconds after the\nmain flow of water has stopped (drainage period must be timed). (7)\n\nRepeat steps (5) and (6)\nhereof. (8)\n\nAllow surface motion of\nwater in holding tank to subside. Lower measuring rod to the surface of the\nwater. Read and record the reading on measuring rod. Record in inches and.02\ninches. (9)\n\nLower the measuring rod\nto the bottom of the tank. Allow surface motion of water in tank to subside. Read and record the reading on the measuring rod. (10)\n\nRecord the difference between the\nreadings in step (7) and step (8) as depth of water in the holding\ntank. (11)\n\nRepeat steps (5), (6), (8), (9) and (10) hereof two more times. (12)\n\nDetermine the cubic foot per inch depth\nat each of the three levels. Cubic foot per inch depth equals the amount of\nmeasured water added divided by the inch depth of water. (Do not include the\nresults of the first dump of water.)\n(13)\n\nDetermine the average cubic foot per\ninch depth by adding together the cubic foot per inch depth at the three levels\nand dividing by three. (14)\n\nIf the\nactual cubic foot/inch depth at any of the three levels varies from the average\ncubic foot/inch depth more than one percent, the tank must be\nrejected. (c) It shall\nbe the responsibility of the owner of cherry holding tanks to have the tanks\ncalibrated. The person or persons calibrating tanks shall be someone other than\na weights and measures official. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n223.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
