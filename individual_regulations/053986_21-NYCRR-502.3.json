  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 502.3 - Reports\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No later than\n\nMarch 1st of each year, each generator shall submit to the director a report\n(one copy), containing the information set forth in subdivision (c) of this\nsection, for the preceding calendar year; provided, that if a generator\ngenerated low-level radioactive waste at facilities located more than 25 miles\napart, or at facilities located 25 miles or less apart for which separate\nauthorizations are held, issued by the operator of a licensed LLRW disposal\nfacility (e.g., site use permit) or the host state in which a licensed LLRW\ndisposal facility is located, which authorize transfer of LLRW to a licensed\nLLRW disposal facility, the generator shall submit a separate report (one copy)\nfor each such facility. (b) In the\nevent two or more persons are generators with respect to the same low-level\nradioactive waste (for instance, because of their relationship as employer and\nemployee or principal and agent), those persons shall designate between or\namong themselves one person who shall submit the report required by this\nsection. The designee shall indicate on the report required by this section the\nidentities of each of the other generators who are not submitting the report, and the nature of the relationships between or among the designee and such\nother generators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subdivision, an employer may submit the report on behalf of its employees, and a medical\ninstitution or university may submit the report on behalf of its physicians, interns, staff, or students who generate LLRW as independent contractors to\nsuch medical institution or university, without identifying the employees, physicians, interns, staff, or students on behalf of whom the report is\nsubmitted. (c) Each report shall\ncontain the following information: (1)\ncalendar year reporting period; (2)\nname, principal office address (and, if different, address of the facility at\nwhich LLRW was generated), e-mail address, if available, and telephone number\nof the generator; (3)\ntype of\ngenerator (e.g., medical, university, industrial, electric utility, or\ngovernmental) and a description of the activity, process, or use of radioactive\nmaterial which results in the generation of LLRW; (4)\nthe information with respect to other\ngenerators, if applicable, described in subdivision (b) of this\nsection; (5)\nname, title, e-mail\naddress, if available, and telephone number of the individual who prepared the\nreport; (6)\nidentification of any\nand all radioactive material and nuclear facility licenses issued by the United\n\nStates Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the New York State Department of Health, or the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene under which LLRW\nis generated, including identification of the respective licensing\nagency; (7)\nidentification of any\nand all authorizations held by the generator, issued by the operator of a\nlicensed LLRW disposal facility (e.g., site use permit) or the host state in\nwhich a licensed LLRW disposal facility is located, which authorize transfer of\nLLRW to its respective licensed LLRW disposal facility; (8)\ndetails regarding LLRW transferred, either directly or through a broker or agent, for disposal at a licensed LLRW\ndisposal facility during the reporting period, including: (i) the total volume, volume by class, and\nactivity by radionuclide and class; (ii)\nthe types and specifications of\nindividual containers used and the number of each type transferred for\ndisposal; (iii)\nthe maximum surface\nradiation exposure level on any single container of LLRW transferred, the\nnumber of disposal containers with surface radiation exposure levels that\nexceed 200 mR/hour, and the identification of the contents of each such\ncontainer by volume, class, and activity by radionuclide; (iv)\nthe volume of Class A LLRW that meets\nthe United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission stability requirements, as set\nforth in section\n61.56(b)\nof title 10, Code of Federal Regulations; (v) the identification of each licensed LLRW\ndisposal facility to which LLRW was transferred, either directly or through a\nbroker or agent, and the volume and activity by class of LLRW transferred to\neach licensed LLRW disposal facility; (vi)\nthe identification of all brokers or\nagents to which LLRW was transferred, the volume and activity by class of LLRW\ntransferred to each, and the volume and activity by class of the generator's\nLLRW transferred by each such broker or agent to each licensed LLRW disposal\nfacility; (vii)\nthe weight of\nsource material by type (e.g., natural uranium, depleted uranium, or\nthorium); (viii)\nthe total number\nof grams of special nuclear material by radionuclide, and the maximum number of\ngrams of special nuclear material in any single shipment by\nradionuclide; (ix)\nas complete a\ndescription as practicable of the principal chemical and physical form of the\nLLRW by volume and radionuclide, including the identification of any known\nhazardous properties, other than its radioactive property; (x) for solidified or sorbed liquids, the\nnature of the liquid, the solidifying or sorbing agent used, and the final\nvolume; (xi)\nfor LLRW containing\nmore than 0.1 percent by weight chelating agents, the identification of the\nchelating agent, the volume and weight of the LLRW and the weight percentage of\nchelating agent; and\n(xii)\n\nWhere\nLLRW identified in this paragraph was treated, either by the generator or its\nagent or independent contractor, in preparation for transfer to a licensed LLRW\ndisposal facility, to reduce its volume or activity (including reduction by\nstorage for decay) or to change its physical or chemical characteristics (other\nthan by solidification or sorption of liquids as addressed in subparagraph (x)\nof this paragraph, a description of the treatment process and the generator's\nbest estimate of the effectiveness in terms of the quantitative volume or\nactivity reduction, or in quantitative or other relevant terms for changes in\nphysical or chemical characteristics, as applicable; (9)\nthe radionuclides originally contained in\nany LLRW generated during the reporting period which was held for decay and\ndisposed of as nonradioactive waste; (10)\na description, including, but not\nlimited to, the capacity in terms of volume of LLRW, of any facilities or parts\nthereof which the generator has dedicated to the storage of LLRW for periods in\nexcess of 90 days prior to transfer, either directly or through a broker or\nagent, to a licensed LLRW disposal facility, and the volume of LLRW stored by\nthe generator in such facilities at the end of the reporting period; (11)\nthe volume, volume by class, and\nactivity by radionuclide and class of that LLRW, if any, which the generator is\nholding at the end of the reporting period because the generator knows or has\nreason to believe that LLRW will not be accepted for disposal at any of the\nlicensed LLRW disposal facilities, and a description of the LLRW and the reason\nit is known or believed to be unacceptable for disposal at any of the licensed\nLLRW disposal facilities; and\n(12)\nan estimate of the period of time the generator could store its LLRW at its\nfacilities without disruption of its LLRW generating activities, should the\ngenerator be unable to transfer LLRW, either directly or through a broker or\nagent, to a licensed LLRW disposal facility. (d) In addition to the information required\nby subdivision (c) of this section, each report shall contain the generator's\nbest estimate in terms of total volume, and volume and activity by class and\nradionuclide, of LLRW that the generator expects to transfer to licensed LLRW\ndisposal facilities in each of the next five calendar\nyears.
