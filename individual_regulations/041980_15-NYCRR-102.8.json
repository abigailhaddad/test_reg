  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 102.8 - Manufacturer's responsibility and certification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions: (1)\n\nProducer. An entity which actually\nfabricates or makes limited use vehicles. (2)\n\nManufacturer. A producer of limited use\nvehicles, or a distributor, importer, subsidiary of the producer or similar\nentity designated by the producer and approved by the commissioner as the agent\nof the producer and approved by the commissioner as the agent of the producer\nfor the purpose of complying with the requirements of this Part. (3)\n\nManufacturer's statement of origin. A\ndocument issued by a manufacturer, the form and content of which is approved by\nthe commissioner, which identifies a specific limited use vehicle, including\nthe maximum performance and identifying year, and which is used by the\nmanufacturer to initially transfer that limited use vehicle. (4)\n\nModel. The name under which a series of\nlimited use vehicles is advertised and sold. A model may contain a number of\nsub-models, and a model may or may not be different than a trade\nname. (5)\n\nSub-model. If a model is\nmanufactured with different maximum performance speeds, limited use vehicles in\neach different maximum performance speed category shall be a sub-model. Each\nmaximum performance speed creates a different sub-model which must be certified\nseparately. Example:Klubnik Motors located in Lalala Republic creates\n\nZippy limited use motorcycles which are imported into New York by Moiety\n\nImporting Corp. Moiety modifies Zippy limited use motorcycles so that some have\na maximum performance speed of 29 m.p.h., some have a maximum performance speed\nof 24 m.p.h. and some have a maximum performance speed of 19 m.p.h.. Moiety\ncreates the statements or origin. Moiety advertises all Zippy limited use\nmotorcycles as Vizzies. Klubnik Motors designated Moiety Importing Corp. as its\nagent for complying with New York laws and regulations. Klubnik Motors is the\nproducer. Moiety Importing Corp. is the manufacturer. Zippy is the trade name. Vizzie is the model. Zippy Vizzie with maximum performance speed of 29 m.p.h is\none sub-model. Zippy Vizzie with maximum performance speed of 24 m.p.h is a\nsecond sub-model. Zippy Vizzie with maximum performance speed of 19 m.p.h is a\nthird sub-model. (6)\n\nTime\nof manufacture. The time at which the maximum performance speed of a limited\nuse vehicle is established by the manufacturer. (7)\n\nTrade name. The name used by the producer\nto identify its limited use vehicles, regardless of model. (8)\n\nIdentifying year. The calendar year used\nby the manufacturer to designate the year classification of the limited use\nvehicle. Such year may be the time of manufacture or it may be the time at\nwhich the manufacturer's statement of origin is issued. (b) Certification. (1)\n\nNo limited use vehicle will be registered\n(or titled, if required) unless a certification of the maximum performance\nspeed of that model (or sub-model, if applicable) limited use vehicle has been\nfiled with the commissioner by the manufacturer and approved by the\ncommissioner. The type of registration issued to a limited use vehicle shall be\nestablished by the commissioner based upon a certification submitted and\napproved for the model (or sub-model, if applicable) limited use\nvehicle. (2)\nA manufacturer's\ncertification may be based upon tests conducted with a production line vehicle\neither by the manufacturer or an independent testing laboratory. The\ncommissioner may require additional testing by a third party approved by the\ncommissioner in any case in which the manufacturer's certification is based\nupon tests conducted by the manufacturer, or for the purpose of confirming the\nvalidity of a prior certification. All expenses of testing shall be borne by\nthe manufacturer. (3)\n\nCertification\nsubmitted by the manufacturer shall contain the following information: name and\naddress of the producer (and manufacturer, if different than the producer); the\ntrade name, model (and sub-model, if applicable), identifying years covered by\nthe certification; the unladen weight of the vehicle, the brake horsepower and\ndisplacement of the engine or motor, a description and explanation of the\nvehicle identification numbers to be assigned by the manufacturer to units of\nthe model (or sub-model, if applicable) tested, including the location of such\nnumber on the frame; and a description (name and model number) of all equipment\non such vehicle which is required for such vehicle to be in compliance with the\nrequirements of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and this Part. The certification\nmust also contain a statement that the vehicle tested meets all requirements of\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law and this Part, and with respect to limited use\nmotorcycles, a statement that the seat or saddle for the operator is at least\n25 inches above the ground. If the seat or saddle is adjustable, that\ncertification shall apply to the seat or saddle in its lowest\nposition. (4)\n\nThe certification\nshall contain a full description of the test procedures used and shall state\nthe maximum speed attained within one quarter mile from a standing start and\nthe average speed of the vehicle for the next ensuing mile. The certification\nmust contain a statement that the vehicle tested is representative of vehicles\nof that model (or sub-model, if applicable) as manufactured for sale in this\n\nState. In addition, a completed sample of the manufacturer's statement of\norigin to be used for the model (or sub-model, if applicable), must be\nsubmitted for approval with the certification. The certification shall be\nsigned by the person who conducted the test who must vouch for its\naccuracy. (5)\n\nThe certification\nshould be submitted to the Bureau of Technical Assessment, Division of Vehicle\n\nSafety, Department of Motor Vehicles, Empire State Plaza, Albany, New York\n12228. (c) Required\ntesting for certification. The rest required for certification may be performed\neither by means of a road test or by means of suitable testing equipment which\nwill simulate road test conditions. The following procedures shall be used: (1)\n\nThe test shall be conducted on a hard, dry surface having a skid number (hardness) of 50 or less and a zero percent\ngrade with a wind velocity of no more than five miles per hour. (2)\n\nWhen testing the vehicle it shall be\nequipped as required for sale in this State, and the head lamps and tail lamps\nshall be lit throughout the test. (3)\n\nThe vehicle shall be tested under a load\nof 150 pounds, not including equipment, in or on the operator's position, and\nwith the engine operating at maximum output. (d) Vehicle identification number. The\nvehicle identification number assigned to a limited use motor vehicle must be\nunique for each limited use vehicle and must be embossed or engraved upon the\nframe of each limited use motorcycle and affixed to a limited use automobile in\naccordance with Federal standards. The number of characters of the vehicle\nidentification number must be in accordance with Federal standards. (e) Establishment of maximum performance\nspeed. If the certification submitted by the manufacturer is acceptable to the\ncommissioner, the maximum performance speed of the model (or sub-model, if\napplicable) so certified will be based upon the average speed of the model (or\nsub-model, if applicable) tested for the one mile distance after the\none-quarter mile acceleration distance. However, the commissioner reserves the\nright to determine a different maximum performance speed, if warranted by the\ntest report submitted. (f) Alternate certification of certain limited use vehicles. If an application for\nregistration of a limited use vehicle for which no certification has been\napproved by the commissioner is made and there is no manufacturer who can\nprovide such certification (examples, manufacturer out of business, homemade\nvehicle, model no longer manufactured and records not available), the Bureau of\n\nTechnical Assessment may prescribe and accept alternate methods of approval and\ncertification of maximum performance speed. (g) Once a certification has been approved, that certification shall apply to all vehicles of the same model (or sub-model, if applicable) manufactured thereafter unless there are changes in the\ntechnical specifications or performance standards. Upon any such change, the\nmanufacturer shall submit a new certification. However, the commissioner may, from time to time request a confirmation of the certification for models, (or\nsub-models, if applicable) manufactured after the identifying years specified\nin the approved certification. Upon such a request for confirmation, the\nmanufacturer must submit a new certification or confirmation of the continuance\nof the prior certification. (h) Verification of specific vehicles. A manufacturer must be able to certify to\nthe commissioner or to the owner of a limited use vehicle the maximum\nperformance speed of any limited use vehicle upon submission of the vehicle\nidentification number or other appropriate number. A manufacturer must honor a\nrequest for such information promptly upon receipt of such request. (i) The provisions of this subdivision shall\napply to low speed vehicles as defined in section\n102.10\n(a) of this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
