That percentage increases to 8% in 2011 and 10% in 2012; and\nWHEREAS, Executive Order 142 also directed that gasoline\npowered state vehicles should use E85 ethanol fuel to the greatest extent\npossible and that the Governor's Clean Vehicle Council should prepare a plan to\nmeet this goal; and\nWHEREAS, since the issuance of Executive Order 142\nadvancements in vehicle engine technology coupled with significant improvements\nin diesel fuel quality have reduced the incremental environmental benefits\nassociated with biofuels in the transportation sector; and\nWHEREAS, the State of New York is suffering though an\neconomic and budget crisis and must, as a result, identify and eliminate\nmandates that are not cost effective; and\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, David A. Paterson, Governor of the State\nof New York, by the virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution\nand Laws of the State of New York, do hereby rescind section II of Executive\n\nOrder 142, thereby eliminating the requirements that state agencies and\nauthorities purchase and utilize bio-diesel in their fleets, that state\nvehicles use E85 to the greatest extent possible and that the Governor's Clean\n\nVehicle Council prepare a plan to meet this goal; and\nFURTHER, my action in rescinding section II does not\nrescind sections III or IV of Executive Order 142, and these sections remain in\nforce.
