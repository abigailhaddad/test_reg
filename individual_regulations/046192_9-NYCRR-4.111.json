  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.111 - Executive Order No. 111: Directing the Attorney General to inquire into matters of bias-related crimes\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, violent criminal acts directed against persons or\ngroups because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, or sexual orientation are an especially pernicious form of criminal\nconduct that damages the fundamental precepts that support and make effective\nour democratic, pluralistic society; WHEREAS, such criminal acts require the immediate and swift\nattention of law enforcement officials because they have a potential to instill\nfear for personal and family security in the affected groups, provoke\ncountermeasures that may lead to further violence, and create an environment of\nhostility and division that is dangerous and counterproductive; WHEREAS, the investigation and prosecution of such criminal\nacts are facilitated by the involvement of personnel especially trained and\nexperienced in such matters and the availability of such personnel helps to\nassure that such criminal acts are forcefully deterred through effective\nprosecution on a consistent basis; WHEREAS, it is therefore appropriate and in the best\ninterest of the citizens of this State to provide for a body of experts, including prosecutors and investigators, specifically trained in the area of\ncrimes motivated by bias that may be called upon by any district attorney in\nthe State to assist in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, and particularly by subdivision eight of section\nsixty three\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, and in accordance with the statute and law in such case made and\nprovided, find it to be in the public interest to require that the Attorney\n\nGeneral inquire, in the circumstances and manner hereafter provided, into\nmatters concerning the public peace, public safety and public justice with\nrespect to possible criminal acts committed in violation of any laws of this\n\nState that may be bias-related crimes. When making an inquiry pursuant to this order, the Attorney\n\nGeneral shall assist in the investigation of bias-related crimes in cooperation\nwith the district attorney of the county wherein the offense or a portion\nthereof is alleged to have been committed, and assist in the prosecution of\nsuch crimes upon the request of the district attorney. In providing such\nassistance, the Attorney General shall only exercise such powers and perform\nsuch duties as are approved by such district attorney. Where such assistance is\nprovided the district attorney shall retain exclusive authority to direct the\ninvestigation and prosecution of the case. For the purposes of this Executive Order, the term\nbias-related crimes\nshall mean acts or threatened or attempted\nacts of intimidation, harassment or physical force directed against any person, or group, or their property or advocate, motivated either in whole or in part\nby hostility to their real or perceived race, ethnic background, national\norigin, religious belief, sex, age, disability, or sexual orientation, with the\nintention of deterring the free exercise or enjoyment of any rights or\nprivileges secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States or the\n\nState of New York whether or not performed under color of law. The Attorney General is hereby so directed in person or by\nhis or her assistant or deputies to have the powers and duties specified in\nsuch subdivision eight for the purpose of this order. The Director of Criminal Justice is hereby designated and\ndirected to receive any information obtained upon such inquiry from any office\nparticipating therein including such information as is contained in the weekly\nreport required to be transmitted to me pursuant to subdivision eight of\nsection\nsixty three\nof the\n\nExecutive Law. The Director of Criminal Justice is further directed to transmit\nto the Special Prosecutor Review Committee established pursuant to Executive\n\nOrder 109 information obtained upon such inquiry as is relevant to any pending\nrequest for the appointment of a Special Prosecutor or which should be reviewed\nby such committee.
