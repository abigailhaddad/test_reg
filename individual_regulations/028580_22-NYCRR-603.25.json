(c) Confidential nature of statements. (1)\n\nAll statements of retainer or closing\nstatements filed shall be deemed to be confidential and the information therein\ncontained shall not be divulged or made available for inspection or examination\nto any person other than the client of the attorney filing said statements\nexcept upon written order of the presiding justice of the Appellate\n\nDivision. (2)\n\nThe Office of Court\n\nAdministration of the State of New York shall reproduce in an alternative\nformat, as that terms is defined in section\n104.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle, all statements filed pursuant to this section by a means that shall\naccurately reproduce the original statements in all details thereof, and shall\nthereafter destroy the originals so reproduced. Such a reproduction in an\nalternative format shall be deemed to be an original record for all purposes, and an enlargement or facsimile thereof may be introduced in evidence in all\ncourts and administrative agencies and in any action, hearing or proceeding in\nplace and stead of the original statement so reproduced, with the same force\nand effect as though the original document were presented. (d) Deposit of collections; notice. (1)\n\nWhenever an attorney, who\nhas accepted a retainer or entered into an agreement as above referred to, shall collect any sum of money upon any such action, claim or proceeding, either by way of settlement or after a trial or hearing, he shall forthwith\ndeposit the same in a special account in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n603.15\nof this Part. Within 15\ndays after the receipt of any such sum he shall cause to be delivered\npersonally to such client or sent by registered or certified mail, addressed to\nsuch client at the client's last known address, a copy of the closing statement\nrequired by this section. At the same time the attorney shall pay or remit to\nthe client the amount shown by such statement to be due the client, and he may\nthen withdraw for himself the amount so claimed to be due him for compensation\nand disbursements. For the purpose of calculating the 15-day period, the\nattorney shall be deemed to have collected or received or been paid a sum of\nmoney on the date that he receives the draft endorsed by the client, or if the\nclient's endorsement is not required, on the date the attorney receives the\nsum. The acceptance by a client of such amount shall be without prejudice to\nthe latter's right in an appropriate action or proceeding, to petition the\ncourt to have the question of the attorney's compensation or reimbursement for\nexpenses investigated and determined by it. (2)\n\nWhenever any sum of money is payable upon\nany such claim, action or proceeding, either by way of settlement or after\ntrial or hearing, and the attorney is unable to locate a client, the attorney\nshall apply, pursuant to Rule 1.15(f) of the Rules of Professional Conduct\n(Part 1200 of this Title [Rule 1.15(f)]), to the court in which such action or\nproceeding was pending, or if no action had been commenced, then to the Supreme\n\nCourt in the county in which the attorney maintains an office, for an order\ndirecting payment to be made to the attorney of the fees and reimbursable\ndisbursements determined by the court to be due said attorney and to the\n\nLawyers Fund for Client Protection of the balance due to the client, for the\naccount of the client, subject to the charge of any lien found by the court to\nbe payable therefrom. (e) Contingent fees in claims and\nactions for personal injury and wrongful death. (1)\n\nIn any claim or action for personal\ninjury or wrongful death, other than one alleging medical, dental or podiatric\nmalpractice, whether determined by judgment or settlement, in which the\ncompensation of claimant's or plaintiff's attorney is contingent, that is, dependent in whole or in part upon the amount of the recovery, the receipt, retention or sharing by such attorney, pursuant to agreement or otherwise, of\ncompensation which is equal to or less than that contained in any schedule of\nfees adopted by this department is deemed to be fair and reasonable. The\nreceipt, retention or sharing of compensation which is in excess of such\nscheduled fees shall constitute the exaction of unreasonable and unconscionable\ncompensation in violation of any provision of the Rules of Professional Conduct\n(Part 1200 of this Title) with respect to conduct on or after April 1, 2009, or\nthe former Code of Professional Responsibility, as adopted by the New York\n\nState Bar Association effective January 1, 1970, as amended, with respect to\nconduct on or before March 31, 2009, unless authorized by a written order of\nthe court as hereinafter provided. (2)\n\nThe following is the schedule of\nreasonable fees referred to in paragraph (1) of this subdivision: either, SCHEDULE A\n(i) 50 percent on the first $1,000 of the sum\nrecovered, (ii)\n40 percent on the\nnext $2,000 of the sum recovered, (iii)\n35 percent on the next $22,000 of the\nsum recovered, (iv)\n25 percent on\nany amount over $25,000 of the sum recovered; or, SCHEDULE B\nA percentage not exceeding 33 percent of the sum\nrecovered. If the initial contractual arrangement between the client and the\nattorney so provides, in which event the procedure hereinafter provided for\nmaking application for additional compensation because of extraordinary\ncircumstances shall not apply. (3)\n\nSuch percentage shall be computed by one\nof the following two methods, to be selected by the client in the retainer\nagreement or letter of engagement: (i) on the\nnet sum recovered after deducting from the amount recovered expenses and\ndisbursements for expert testimony and investigative or other services properly\nchargeable to the enforcement of the claim or prosecution of the action; or\n(ii)\nin the event that the\nattorney agrees to pay costs and expenses of the action pursuant to Judiciary\n\nLaw section 488(2)(d), on the gross sum recovered before deducting expenses and\ndisbursements. The retainer agreement or letter of engagement shall describe\nthese alternative methods, explain the financial consequences of each, and\nclearly indicate the client's selection. In computing the fee, the costs as\ntaxed, including interest upon a judgment, shall be deemed part of the amount\nrecovered. For the following or similar items there shall be no deduction in\ncomputing such percentages: liens, assignments or claims in favor of hospitals, for medical care and treatment by doctors and nurses, or of self-insurers or\ninsurance carriers. (4)\n\nIn the event that claimant's or plaintiff's attorney believes in good faith\nthat Schedule A, above, because of extraordinary circumstances, will not give\nhim adequate compensation, application for greater compensation may be made\nupon affidavit with written notice and an opportunity to be heard to the client\nand other persons holding liens or assignments on the recovery. Such\napplication shall be made to the justice of the trial part to which the action\nhad been sent for trial; or, if it had not been sent to a part for trial, then\nto the justice presiding at the trial term calendar part of the court in which\nthe action had been instituted; or, if no action had been instituted, then to\nthe justice presiding at the trial term calendar part of the Supreme Court for\nthe county in the judicial department in which the attorney who filed the\nstatement of retainer, pursuant to this section, has an office. Upon such\napplication, the justice, in his discretion, if extraordinary circumstances are\nfound to be present, and without regard to the claimant's or plaintiff's\nconsent, may fix as reasonable compensation for legal services rendered an\namount greater than that specified in Schedule A, above; provided, however, that such greater amount shall not exceed the fee fixed pursuant to the\ncontractual arrangement, if any, between the client and the attorney. If the\napplication be granted, the justice shall make a written order accordingly, briefly stating the reasons for granting the greater compensation; and a copy\nof such order shall be served on all persons entitled to receive notice of the\napplication. (5)\n\nThe provisions of\nthis subdivision shall not apply to an attorney retained as counsel in a claim\nor action for personal injury or wrongful death by another attorney, if such\nother attorney is not subject to the provisions of this section in such claim\nor action, but all other subdivisions of this section shall apply. (6)\n\nNothing contained in this subdivision\nshall be deemed applicable to the fixing of compensation for attorneys\nrepresenting infants or other persons, where the statutes or rules provide for\nthe fixation of such compensation by the court. (7)\n\nNothing contained in this subdivision\nshall be deemed applicable to the fixing of compensation for attorneys for\nservices rendered in connection with the collection of first-party benefits as\ndefined by section\n5102\nof the\n\nInsurance Law. (8)\n\nThe provisions\nof paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall not apply to claims alleging\nmedical, dental, or podiatric malpractice. Compensation of claimant's or\nplaintiff's attorney for services rendered in claims or actions for personal\ninjury alleging medical, dental or podiatric malpractice shall be computed\npursuant to the fee schedule in Judiciary Law, section 474-a. (f) Preservation of records\nof claims and actions. Attorneys for both plaintiff and defendant in the\ncase of any such claim or cause of action shall preserve, for a period of seven\nyears after any settlement or satisfaction of the claim or cause of action or\nany judgment thereon or after the dismissal or discontinuance of any action, the pleadings and other papers pertaining to such claim or cause of action, including, but not limited to, letters or other data relating to the claim of\nloss of time from employment or loss of income; medical reports, medical bills, X-ray reports, X- ray bills; repair bills, estimates of repairs; all\ncorrespondence concerning the claim or cause of action; and memoranda of the\ndisposition thereof as well as cancelled vouchers, receipts and memoranda\nevidencing the amounts disbursed by the attorney to the client and others in\nconnection with the aforesaid claim or cause of action and such other records\nas are required to be maintained under section\n603.27\nof this\n\nPart.
