  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 100.12 - Universal Life Policies That Guarantee That Coverage Will Remain In Force As Long As The Accumulation Of Premiums Paid Satisfies The Secondary Guarantee Requirement Mortality Improvement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section applies to universal life policies that guarantee that coverage will remain in force as long as the accumulation of premiums paid satisfies the secondary guarantee requirement, issued on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2017, or on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2020 if optionally elected under subdivision (b) of this section. (b) An insurer that as of December 31, 2016 utilized the provisions of this section for any universal life policies that guarantee that coverage will remain in force as long as the accumulation of premiums paid satisfies the secondary guarantee requirement issued on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2017, may elect to continue to apply the provisions of this section to universal life policies that guarantee that coverage will remain in force as long as the accumulation of premiums paid satisfies the secondary guarantee requirement issued on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to January 1, 2020, provided that the insurer provides written notification to the superintendent by February 28, 2020. (c) An insurer shall use the methodology for applying mortality improvement scale LT in conjunction with either the 2001 CSO Mortality Table, or for preferred lives meeting the conditions of section\n100.9\nof this Part, the 2001 CSO Preferred Class Structure Mortality Table. The resulting mortality adjusted table shall be the minimum mortality standard for policies issued on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2017, or on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to January 1, 2020 if optionally elected under subdivision (b) of this section. (d) (1)\n\nThe annual improvement rates, LT1 and LT2, from mortality improvement scale LT shall be applied only within the first segment. The length of each segment shall be determined at issue by the Contract Segmentation Method, as described in Part 98.5 of this Title. The value, t, shall be the number of policy years after the year 2008. The annual improvement rates and the formula for applying the rate are shown in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe mortality rate for a person age x in year (2008 + t) is calculated as follows, where\nq\nx\n2008\nis the appropriate rate from the 2001 CSO Mortality Table, or for preferred lives meeting the conditions of section\n100.9\nof this Part, the 2001 CSO Preferred Class Structure Mortality Table: (i) q\nx\n2008+t\n=\nq\nx\n2008\n* (1 - LT1)\nt\nfor t = 1 through 40; (ii)\nq\nx\n2008+t\n=\nq\nx\n2008\n* (1 -LT1)\n40\n* (1 -LT2)\n(t-40)\nfor t = 41 and greater; (iii)\nLT1 equals 0.01; (iv)\nLT2 equals 0.005; (v) the mortality rate for attained ages 81 through 90 shall be linearly graded from the adjusted q\nx\n2008+t\nrates back to the unadjusted q\nx\n2008\nrates; and\n(vi)\nthe resulting\nq\nx\n2008+t\nshall be rounded to two decimal places per 1,000, e.g., 0.68 deaths per 1,000. After the first segment, the rates revert to the\nq\nx\n2008\nrates. (e) A numerical example of applying the annual improvement rates and formulas from subdivision (e) of this section follows. The example assumes a super-preferred 45 year old male non-smoker with issue year 2015. The unadjusted mortality table, q\nx\n2008, is the 2001 CSO M NS Super Preferred ANB Select & Ultimate Mortality Table. The first segment has a length of 75 years. Select mortality rates shall be used only for the first segment and the Ultimate rates of the 2001 CSO M NS Super Preferred ANB table must be used thereafter. The rates of mortality per 1,000 lives based on age nearest birthday through attained age 90 are shown below.
