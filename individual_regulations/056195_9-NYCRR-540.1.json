  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 540.1 - Purpose, intent and applicability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of this Part is to establish standards and procedures governing the\nuse and authentication of electronic signatures and the utilization of\nelectronic records in accordance with article III of the State Technology Law, which establishes the Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA). ESRA\nrequires the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS), as the electronic\nfacilitator, to establish rules governing the use of electronic signatures and\nrecords. ESRA recognizes the importance of technology to the State and the need\nto build a foundation for its acceptance, implementation and use by State\nagencies, local government, the private sector and citizens. Consistent with\nlegislative intent, ESRA establishes that electronic signatures and records\nhave the same force and effect as signatures and records produced by\nnonelectronic means and should be utilized to facilitate both business in, as\nwell as the business of, New York State. (b) ESRA and this Part, among other things, ensure that persons who voluntarily elect to use electronic signatures or\nelectronic records can do so with confidence that they carry the same force and\neffect as nonelectronic signatures and records. Consistent with ESRA and this\n\nPart, parties agreeing to engage in electronic transactions may deploy\nelectronic signatures and records in a manner that meets their practices and\nneeds. (c) New technologies are\nfrequently being introduced. The intent of this Part is to be flexible enough\nto embrace future technologies that comply with ESRA and all other applicable\nstatutes and regulations. The electronic facilitator shall conduct periodic\nreviews of the regulations to ensure that the regulations facilitate and\npromote the use of technological advancements and address privacy and\nconfidentiality issues. (d) Neither\nESRA nor this Part requires any person to use a document bearing an electronic\nsignature. Under ESRA and this Part, the use or acceptance of electronic\nrecords by governmental entities is voluntary. (e) In accordance with ESRA, the use of an\nelectronic signature as defined in ESRA shall have the same validity and effect\nas the use of a signature affixed by hand. Neither ESRA, nor this Part, shall\nin whole, or in part, be construed to limit any legal rights or privileges, contractual or otherwise, that parties may have in the use of electronic\nsignatures and records. (f) ESRA\nand this Part are designed to, among other things, afford governmental entities\nthe greatest latitude to determine the most effective protocols for producing, receiving, accepting, acquiring, recording, filing, transmitting, forwarding\nand storing electronic signatures and electronic records within the confines of\nexisting statutory and regulatory requirements regarding privacy, confidentiality and records retention. (g) This Part also establishes standards to\nimplement chapter 549 of the Laws of 2011 in relation to the electronic\nrecording of instruments affecting real property by recording officers in New\n\nYork State. Chapter 549 amended ESRA to allow for the use and acceptance of\nelectronic signatures and records with conveyances and other instruments\nrecordable under article nine of the Real Property Law. Chapter 549 also added\na new section 291-i to the Real Property Law, permitting, but not requiring, recording officers to participate in electronic recording of instruments\naffecting real property. Real Property Law section 291-i requires ITS, as the\nelectronic facilitator, to promulgate rules and regulations governing the use\nand acceptance of digitized paper documents, electronic records and electronic\nsignatures in the recording of instruments affecting real property. These rules\nand regulations are to prescribe standards to ensure that electronic records of\ninstruments affecting real property documents a re accurate, authentic, adequately preserved for long-term electronic storage and resistant to\ntampering.
