  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5.109 - Executive order no. 109: establishing a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute criminal acts relating to fraudulent motor vehicle insurance claims\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the Comprehensive Motor Vehicle Insurance\n\nReparations Act (commonly known as the \"No-Fault law\") was enacted by the New\n\nYork State Legislature over twenty-five years ago to ensure that every accident\nvictim will be compensated for economic loss, promptly and without regard to\nfault; WHEREAS, this No-Fault system has succeeded in stabilizing\nthe costs of automobile insurance in this State while benefitting consumers by\ncombining a package of first-party benefits for economic losses resulting from\ninjury and prompt payment of such benefits, in return for allowing suits for\nnon-economic damages only for specified serious injuries; WHEREAS, recently there has been a dramatic increase in the\ncost of some motor vehicle insurance coverages, and much of this increase is\nattributable to fraudulent and abusive motor vehicle insurance claims\npractices. In fact, it has been alleged that motor vehicle insurance fraud may\ncost the average New York consumer hundreds of dollars per year in higher\ninsurance premiums; WHEREAS, fraudulent and abusive claims activity harms\nconsumers, health care providers and insurers by increasing insurance costs, slowing claims processing and payment, and creating an increasingly adversarial\nrelationship among affected parties; WHEREAS, law enforcement agencies and District Attorneys\nhave made significant efforts to combat this growing motor vehicle insurance\nfraud problem and have acted with diligence to prosecute insurance cases in\ntheir jurisdictions. The investigation, development and prosecution of such\ncases require significant resources, however, and existing resources are being\nstretched in these efforts to respond to this fast-growing problem; WHEREAS, it is necessary to bolster and augment the\nimportant work being done by our State's law enforcement and prosecutorial\ncommunities by directing additional prosecutorial and investigative resources\nin areas where fraudulent motor vehicle insurance activity is prevalent; WHEREAS, the benefit to be derived from such efforts can be\nincreased further by fostering greater coordination among prosecutors and law\nenforcement officials in their battle against motor vehicle insurance\nfraud. NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, and particularly by subdivision eight of section\n63\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, and in accordance with the statute and law in such cases made\nand provided, find it to be in the public interest to require that the Attorney\n\nGeneral inquire, in the circumstances and the manner hereafter provided, into\nmatters concerning public peace, public safety and public justice with respect\nto criminal acts relating to fraudulent motor vehicle insurance claims. I. Special Prosecutor\n1. I hereby appoint the Attorney General as\n\nSpecial Prosecutor to coordinate the investigatory and prosecutorial efforts\npursuant to this Executive Order. The Attorney General and such deputies and\nassistants as he deems necessary shall have the powers and duties specified in\nsubdivision eight of section\n63\nof the\n\nExecutive Law for the purposes of this Executive Order. 2. The Superintendent of the Division of\n\nState Police and the Superintendent of the Department of Insurance are directed\nto authorize the Attorney General, pursuant to the provisions of subdivision\nthree of section\n63\nof the\n\nExecutive Law and the statutes and law in such cases made and provided, to\nconduct an investigation of the alleged commission of any indictable offense or\noffenses as provided by the Penal, Insurance or Vehicle and Traffic Laws\narising out of motor vehicle insurance claims, or to other crimes related to\nthis activity or uncovered by the Attorney General in connection with his\nactivities pursuant to this Executive Order, and to prosecute the person or\npersons believed to have committed the same and any crime or offense arising\nout of such investigation or prosecution or both, including, but not limited\nto, appearing before and presenting all such matters to a grand jury. 3. The Special Prosecutor is requested and\nauthorized to cooperate with and assist District Attorneys, the Division of\n\nState Police, the Insurance Department, the Division of Criminal Justice\n\nServices and other law enforcement officials in their efforts against\nfraudulent or otherwise criminal acts committed in violation of any laws of\nthis State in connection with motor vehicle insurance claims. II. Report\n\nThe Division of Criminal Justice Services, in consultation\nwith the Special Prosecutor, the Insurance Department and the Division of State\n\nPolice, shall prepare an annual report to the Governor regarding the efficacy\nof efforts to investigate and prosecute motor vehicle insurance fraud cases\nundertaken pursuant to this order on or before the first day of March of each\nyear. III. Assistance of\n\nState Agencies\n\nThe Division of State Police, the Division of Criminal\n\nJustice Services, the Insurance Department and every other State department, agency, division, board, bureau, commission and any other entity over which I\nhave executive power shall provide appropriate assistance and cooperate as\nnecessary with the Special Prosecutor, the State's District Attorneys and other\nlaw enforcement officials to fulfill the purposes of this Executive\n\nOrder.
