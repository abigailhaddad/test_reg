  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 4C.08 - Warrant 7. Crash Experience\n\nState Regulations\nINSERT the following paragraph: Support: 03A Types of accidents have an important bearing on the\nneed for signalization. However, installation of a signal because of one\nspectacular or highly publicized accident is not justified. Traffic control signals cannot be expected to reduce the\nfollowing types of accidents: Rear-end collisions (which usually increase after\nsignalization); Collisions between vehicles proceeding in the same or\nopposite directions where one turns across the path of the other, if no\nindependent signal interval will be provided for these turn movements; and\n\nAccidents involving pedestrians and turning vehicles when\nboth move during the same \"go\" interval. Traffic control signals when obeyed by drivers and\npedestrians can be expected to reduce the number and severity of the following\ntypes of accidents: Substantially right-angle collisions or those involving\nconflicts between vehicles which approach on intersecting highways: Those involving conflicts between straight-moving vehicles\nand crossing pedestrians; and\n\nThose involving straight-moving vehicles and left-turning\nvehicles approaching from opposite directions, if a protected left turn\ninterval will be provided during the signal cycle for the left turn\nmovement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n4C.08\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
