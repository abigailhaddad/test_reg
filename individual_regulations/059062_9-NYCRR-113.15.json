  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 113.15 - Laboratory Testing Requirements for Medical Cannabis\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Medical cannabis products produced by a\nregistered organization shall be examined by an independent laboratory\nphysically located in New York State that is permitted by the office and\napproved for the analysis of medical cannabis in accordance article 3 of the\n\nCannabis Law, and Part 130 of this Title. (b) No board member, officer, manager, owner, partner, principal stakeholder or member of a registered organization, or such\npersons' immediate family member, shall have an interest or voting rights in\nthe independent laboratory performing medical cannabis testing. (c) For final product testing, a\nrepresentative number of samples from the registered organization containing\nthe medical cannabis product in the respective product packaging shall be\nsampled and transported for final product testing in a manner approved by the\noffice. (d) Testing of the final\nmedical cannabis product is mandatory. However, at the option of the registered\norganization, testing may be performed on components used for the production of\nthe final medical cannabis product, including but not limited to water or\ngrowing materials. Testing may also be performed on intermediate cannabis\nextract (e.g. for phytocannabinoid profile verification or contaminant\ntesting). (e) Sampling and testing\nof each lot of final medical cannabis product shall be conducted with a\nrepresentative sample of a cannabis product batch by collecting a minimum\nnumber of sample increments relative to the batch size as set forth in guidance\nprovided by the Office. (f) Testing\nof the phytocannabinoid profile shall include, at a minimum, those analytes\nspecified in section\n113.12\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (g) Testing for\ncontaminants in the final medical cannabis product shall include analytes, pesticides, or growth regulators determined by the Office. The Office shall\nmake available a list of required analytes, pesticides or growth regulators for\nfinal product testing and the acceptable limits as determined by the\n\nOffice. (h) Stability testing shall\nbe performed by a registered organization or permitted independent laboratory\non each medical cannabis product as follows: (1)\n\nFor testing of open products, stability\ntesting shall be performed, at time zero when opened and then, at a minimum, at\nsixty (60) days from the date of first analysis. This shall establish use of\nthe product within a specified time once opened. (2)\n\nFor testing of unopened products, until\nstability studies have been completed, a registered organization may assign a\ntentative expiration date based on available stability information. The\nregistered organization must concurrently have stability studies conducted to\ndetermine the actual expiration date of an unopened product. (3)\n\nFor stability testing of both opened and\nunopened cannabis products, each cannabis product shall retain a total THC and\ntotal CBD concentration in milligrams per single serving that is consistent\nwith paragraph 113.12(b)(2) of this Part. If the product no longer retains a\nconsistent concentration of total THC and total CBD pursuant to paragraph\n113.12(b)(2) of this Part, the product shall be deemed no longer suitable for\nconsumption and destroyed by the registered organization in accordance with\nsection\n113.25\nof this Part. The registered\norganization shall demonstrate the ongoing stability over time of any product\nform produced as deemed necessary by, but not limited to, product stability\nconcerns or complaints, new stability information about cannabis, for internal\naudit, or as requested by the office and shall provide such documentation\nwhenever requested from the office. (4)\n\nThe Office may waive any of the\nrequirements of this subsection upon good cause shown. (i) Any submitted medical cannabis products\nthat are deemed unsuitable for testing shall be returned to the registered\norganization under chain of custody. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n113.15\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register February 22, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 08, eff. 2/22/2023\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register March 27, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 13, eff. 3/27/2024\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) Medical cannabis products produced by a\nregistered organization\nshall be examined by an independent laboratory physically located in New York\n\nState\nthat is permitted by the\n\nOffice\nand approved for the analysis of medical cannabis in accordance Article 3 of the Cannabis\n\nLaw, and this Part. A laboratory licensed by the New York\n\nState\n\nDepartment\nof Health to conduct medical cannabis testing shall be deemed a \"permittee\" and must continue to comply with all applicable sections set forth in Subpart 55-2 of Title 10 NYCRR, in addition to this Part. (b) No\nboard member, officer, manager, owner, partner, principal stakeholder or member of a\nregistered organization, or such persons' immediate\nfamily member, shall have an interest or voting rights in the independent laboratory performing medical cannabis testing. (c) For final product testing, a statistically significant number of samples from the\nregistered organization\ncontaining the final\nmedical cannabis product\nequivalent to the sealed\nmedical cannabis product\ndispensed to the patient (e.g., liquid extract in a sealed bottle or intact sealed bottle of capsules) shall be collected and submitted for final product testing in a manner approved by the\n\nOffice. (d) Testing of the final\nmedical cannabis product\nis mandatory. However, at the option of the\nregistered organization, testing\nmay\nbe performed on components used for the production of the final\nmedical cannabis product, including but not limited to water or growing materials. Testing\nmay\nalso be performed on intermediate cannabis extract (e.g. for\nphytocannabinoid\nprofile verification or contaminant testing). (e) Sampling and testing of each\nlot\nof final\nmedical cannabis product\nshall be conducted with a representative sample of a cannabis product batch by collecting a minimum number of sample increments relative to the batch size as set forth in guidance provided by the\n\nOffice. (f) Testing of the\nphytocannabinoid\nprofile shall include, at a minimum, those analytes specified in section\n113.12\n(b)(1)\nof this Part. (g) Testing for contaminants in the final\nmedical cannabis product\nshall include analytes, pesticides, or growth regulators determined by the\n\nOffice. The\n\nOffice\nshall make available a list of required analytes, pesticides or growth regulators for final product testing and the acceptable limits as determined by the\n\nOffice. (h) Independent laboratories performing final\nmedical cannabis product\ntesting pursuant to this section must report all results, which includes, but is not limited to, a\ncertificate of analysis, to the\n\nOffice, in a manner and timeframe prescribed by the\n\nOffice. (i) Stability testing shall be performed by a\nregistered organization\nor permitted independent laboratory on each\nmedical cannabis product\nas follows: (1)\n\nFor testing of open products, stability testing shall be performed, at time zero when opened and then, at a minimum, at sixty (60) days from the date of first analysis. This shall establish use of the product within a specified time once opened. (2)\n\nFor testing of unopened products, until stability studies have been completed, a\nregistered organization\nmay\nassign a tentative\nexpiration date\nbased on available stability information. The\nregistered organization\nmust concurrently have stability studies conducted to determine the actual\nexpiration date\nof an unopened product. (3)\n\nFor stability testing of both opened and unopened cannabis products, each cannabis product shall retain a total THC and CBD concentration in milligrams per single serving that is consistent with paragraph 113.12(b)(2) of this Part. If the product no longer retains a consistent concentration of THC and CBD pursuant to paragraph 113.12(b)(2) of this Part, the product shall be deemed no longer suitable for consumption and destroyed by the\nregistered organization\nin accordance with section\n113.25\nof this Part.
