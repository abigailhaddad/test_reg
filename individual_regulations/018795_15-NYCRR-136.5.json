Upon reviewing an application for relicensing, the Commissioner\nshall review the applicant's entire driving record and evaluate any offense\ncommitted between the date of the revocable offense and the date the\napplication is reviewed by the Commissioner as if it had been committed\nimmediately prior to the date of the revocable offense. For purposes of this\nsection, \"date of the revocable offense\" means the date of the earliest\nrevocable offense that resulted in a license revocation for which the\nrevocation has not been terminated by the Commissioner's subsequent approval of\nan application for relicensing. (b) Upon receipt of a person's application\nfor relicensing, the commissioner shall conduct a lifetime review of such\nperson's driving record. If the record review shows that: (1)\nthe person has four or more alcohol- or\ndrug-related driving convictions or incidents in any combination within his or\nher lifetime, then the Commissioner shall deny the application.

Such waiting period shall be in addition to the revocation period imposed\npursuant to the Vehicle and Traffic Law. After such waiting period, the\n\nCommissioner may in his or her discretion approve the application, provided\nthat upon such approval, the Commissioner shall impose the A2 restriction on\nsuch person's license for a period of five years and shall require the\ninstallation of an ignition interlock device in any motor vehicle owned or\noperated by such person for such five-year period. Such waiting period shall be\nextended for an additional five years if the Commissioner finds that the person\nhas any incidents of driving during the waiting period, as indicated by\naccidents, convictions or pending tickets or adjudications. If such license\nwith an A2 restriction is later revoked for a subsequent alcohol- or\ndrug-related driving conviction or incident or for a conviction which arises\nout of a fatal accident, such person shall thereafter be ineligible for any\nkind of license to operate a motor vehicle.

After such waiting period, the Commissioner may in his or\nher discretion approve the application, provided that upon such approval, the\n\nCommissioner shall impose an A2 restriction, with no ignition interlock\nrequirement, for a period of two years. Such waiting period shall be extended\nfor an additional two years if the Commissioner finds that the person has any\nincidents of driving during the waiting period, as indicated by accidents, convictions or pending tickets or adjudications. If such license with an A2\nrestriction is later revoked for a subsequent alcohol- or drug-related driving\nconviction or incident or for a conviction which arises out of a fatal\naccident, such person shall thereafter be ineligible for any kind of license to\noperate a motor vehicle; (5)\nthe person has two alcohol- or\ndrug-related driving convictions or incidents in any combination within the 25\nyear look back period, then the commissioner may in his or her discretion\napprove the application after the minimum statutory revocation period is\nserved; (6)\nthe person has been\ntwice convicted of a violation of subdivision three, four or four-a of section\n1192\nof the Vehicle and traffic law or of driving while intoxicated or of driving\nwhile ability is impaired by the use of a drug or of driving while ability is\nimpaired by the combined influence of drugs or of alcohol and any drug or drugs\nwhere physical injury, as defined in section\n10.00\nof the Penal\nlaw, has resulted from such offense in each instance, then the commissioner\nshall deny the application; (7)\nthe\nperson is otherwise eligible for relicensing under this section, but is\napplying for relicensing due to revocation arising out of an alcohol-related\nconviction involving a fatal accident, the Commissioner may approve the\napplication after the minimum revocation period is served, provided that upon\nsuch approval, the Commissioner shall impose the A2 restriction on such\nperson's license for a period of three years and shall require the installation\nof an ignition interlock device in any motor vehicle owned or operated by such\nperson for such period. For the purpose of this paragraph, \"alcohol-related\nconviction\" shall mean (i) a conviction of a violation of section\n1192\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, or (ii) a conviction of an offense under the\n\nPenal Law for which a violation of section\n1192\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law is an essential element. (c) The grounds for any denial shall be set\nforth in writing and a copy shall be made available to the person making the\napplication for relicensing. (d) While it is the Commissioner's general policy to act on applications in\naccordance with this section, the Commissioner shall not be foreclosed from\nconsideration of unusual, extenuating and compelling circumstances that may be\npresented for review and which may form a valid basis to deviate from the\ngeneral policy, as set forth above, in the exercise of discretionary authority\ngranted under sections\n510\nand\n1193\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. If an application is approved based upon the\nexercise of such discretionary authority, the reasons for approval shall be set\nforth in writing and recorded. If an approval is granted based upon unusual, extenuating and compelling circumstances, the applicant may be issued a license\nor permit with a problem driver restriction, as set forth in section\n3.2\n(c)(4)\nof this\n\nTitle, and may be required to install an ignition interlock device in any motor\nvehicle owned or operated by such person for a period of five years. The\nprovisions of this subdivision shall not apply to denials under paragraph (6)\nof subdivision (b) of this section. (e) If there are two alcohol or drugrelated\ndriving convictions or incidents on an applicant's driving record, the\nconsideration of an application for relicensing shall be held in abeyance if\nthe applicant has at least one ticket pending for alcohol or drugrelated\ndriving offenses where the pending ticket or tickets, if disposed of as a\nconviction of the original charge, would result in the denial of the\napplication. In addition, if, after an application for relicensing is approved, the Commissioner receives information that indicates that such application\nshould have been denied or that the applicant operated a motor vehicle prior to\napproval or after approval of such application but prior to obtaining a valid\npermit or license, the Commissioner shall rescind such approval and the license\nor privilege granted shall be revoked.
