Tit. 18 § 609.5 - Conditions of cost reimbursement\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept as otherwise required for particular programs or\nactivities, costs must be claimed as directed by the department and in\naccordance with the general reimbursement and allocation principles and\nconditions described in department regulations. (a) Administrative surveys or management\nstudies. Reimbursement will be available for the cost of surveys or management\nstudies made by private agencies only when prior written approval has been\nobtained from the department and the survey or management study is conducted in\naccordance with department requirements. Requests for approval under this\nsubdivision should contain the following information: (1)\nthe reason for the survey or management\nstudy; (2)\nthe scope of the survey\nor management study; (3)\nthe\ninformation needed to be collected during the survey or management\nstudy; (4)\nthe potential sources of\nthe information; (5)\nthe objectives\nor constraints imposed upon the survey or management study; (6)\nthe potential problems; (7)\nthe tentative schedule for\ncompletion; (8)\nthe format for\nrecommendations by the party conducting the survey or study; (9)\nthe cost effectiveness indications to be\ncontained in the recommendations of the survey or management study; and\n(10)\na personnel resource\nstatement indicating the availability of qualified and adequate staff, including the identification of a project director. (b) Medical examinations. Reimbursement is\navailable for administrative costs of medical examinations and consultations\nrequired for: (1)\nprogram determinations, such as eligibility or employability; (2)\nfoster parents and day care providers; and\n(3)\nestablishing child support\nresponsibility. (c) Transportation costs. Reimbursement is available for transportation costs as\nadministrative costs only when reimbursable expense does not include any\ntransportation tax and: (1)\npayment is not\nmade directly to a provider, vendor or other entity within the context of a\nspecified program; or\n(2)\nthe\ntransportation costs are for a recipient, his or her representative or\nwitnesses, including transportation costs related to child care, when such\ncosts are reasonably relevant to a fair hearing and have been authorized by a\nsocial services official pursuant to department regulations; or\n(3)\npayments are made to recipients of\nmedical assistance, their legal guardians, family members or attendants; or\n(4)\nexpenditures are made for\nbus passes, or for bus or subway tokens, where the costs are not identified to\nthe recipients or clients. (d) Reserved accommodations. Reimbursement is\navailable for payments made to certified foster boarding homes for assuring\nthat adequate accommodations will be available for immediate reception and\nproper care of children for whom the commissioner has responsibility to provide\nfoster care only when: (1)\npayments for\nreserved accommodations are based upon a rate that does not exceed 50 percent\nof the rate of payment when a child is in the home; (2)\nthe total number of reserved\naccommodations does not exceed five percent of the total number of certified\nboarding home beds in use on the last day of the previous month or other period\nreported in accordance with department requirements; and\n(3)\nthe home is not reimbursed solely for\nreserved accommodations without being utilized for the care of a foster child\nfor a period in excess of three consecutive months. (e) Electronic data processing (EDP)\nequipment and operations. Reimbursement is available for the cost of the\nacquisition and operation of EDP equipment only when prior approval has been\nobtained from the department. (f) Office space. Reimbursement is available only for costs supported as an actual\noutlay incurred in providing office space representing a benefit to a social\nservices district. Rental charges claimed must not exceed actual cost. Before\ncommitments are made for the construction, reconstruction, conversion or\npurchase of a public building in which a social services district is to occupy\noffice space, local social services officials must consult with the department\nfor the purpose of determining whether the proposed plans will adequately meet\nthe needs of the district. The department must also be consulted regarding\nplans for repairs or alterations to either publicly or privately owned office\nspace occupied or to be occupied by a social services district. (1)\n\nPrivately owned space. Reimbursement of\nrent paid by a governmental entity on behalf of a social services district for\nthe use of space in a privately owned building will be based on the actual rent\npaid by such entity. Where it is necessary for the governmental entity to pay, in addition to the rent, certain maintenance costs such as fuel, light, power, water, real estate taxes, insurance or materials, supplies and contractual\nservices for cleaning, decorating and recurring repairs, reimbursement will be\nbased on actual payments made. Reimbursement for repairs and alterations of a\nnonrecurring nature may be claimed, provided: (i) the cost of repairs and alterations plus\nthe rent paid does not exceed comparable commercial rent; (ii)\nthe repairs and alterations are\nnecessary to meet the particular office needs of the social services district\nand the cost is to be borne by the responsible governmental entity under the\nterms of the lease; (iii)\nthe\nproposed repairs and alterations will not unreasonably enhance the value of the\nproperty for the landlord upon the termination of the lease; and\n(iv)\nthe costs of major repairs and\nalterations are spread over the life of the lease and the amount of\nreimbursement to be paid during a particular claiming period is determined by\nmultiplying the total cost of the repairs and/or alterations by a fraction in\nwhich the length of the claiming period is the numerator and the total duration\nof the lease is the denominator. (2)\n\nPublicly owned space. Office space\noccupied by a governmental entity in a building owned by another governmental\nentity or subdivision will be considered to be publicly owned space. Reimbursement for interest costs will be available to the extent that federal\nparticipation is available for interest incurred to finance the capital\nexpenditures for office space. Other capital investments in public buildings\nmay be claimed only as maintenance costs in lieu of rent or as depreciation\nrepresenting such costs. Capital investments include the following: (i) construction of a building; (ii)\nconstruction of an addition to a\nbuilding; (iii)\npurchase of a\nbuilding and the repair, alteration or reconstruction of the building to make\nthe space suitable for occupancy; (iv)\nreconstruction or alteration of a\nbuilding; and\n(v) capital repairs\nand alterations of a nonrecurring nature. (3)\n\nMaintenance in lieu of rent. Reimbursement will be available for the cost of service and maintenance in lieu\nof rent in public buildings when such costs can be identified as the expense of\nmaintaining the space suitable for continuous occupancy. (i) Reimbursement may be claimed for direct\nexpenses of a social services district, including cleaning, fuel, light, power\nand water. Indirect expenses, including depreciation and allowable expenditures\nfor maintenance incurred by other governmental entities or subdivisions, may\nalso be claimed periodically at a monthly rate of 1/12 of the annual cost per\nsquare foot. (ii)\n\nMaintenance costs\nin lieu of rent will not exceed the comparable rent of privately owned space in\nthe community or similar location with equal convenience to the agency. Costs\nwill be computed on the basis of an annual square-foot rate, which is a\nreasonable approximation of actual costs, unless actual costs can be determined\nand claimed on a current basis. Subsequent to the close of the district's\nfiscal year, the approximated costs claimed for the previous year shall be\nadjusted on the basis of actual cost. (iii)\n\nClaims for reimbursement relating to\nspace must be reconciled with a statement of approximated annual maintenance\ncosts supported, except when otherwise instructed by the department, by three\nindependent written appraisals of comparable rent. The statement will also\ninclude an estimate of total direct and indirect costs, a total cost rate per\nsquare foot for comparison purposes, and an indirect expense rate per square\nfoot for use in claiming reimbursement. (iv)\n\nPrior approval of the department is\nrequired for reimbursement whenever the total cost rate per square foot exceeds\n75 percent of the lowest appraisal of comparable rent. The department will\nconsider granting such approval only if the district submits to the department\nthe necessary information on office space rental charges for publicly owned\nbuildings and a statement, with supporting documentation, of estimated annual\nmaintenance costs relating to space. (v) For the first year of occupancy, the\ninitial request for approval must be submitted no later than the end of the\nfirst quarter in which the space is occupied and the final schedules of\nestimated annual costs not later than the end of the second quarter. An\nextension of time may be requested if there is an unavoidable delay in the\ncompilation of the necessary data, provided that the department is notified\nimmediately in writing of the reasons for the expected delay. (vi)\n\nNot later than six months following the\nclose of the annual period upon which an estimated rate for maintenance in lieu\nof rent has been established, the rate must be revised based upon actual costs\ndetermined for the year. (vii)\n\nRetroactive claims for reimbursement based upon a revised rate must be made\nbefore the last day for submission of the regular claim for the period\nincluding the sixth month of the next fiscal year and may include adjustments\nfrom and including the first month of the prior fiscal year. If, when\ncalculating the actual costs for the prior year, it is found that total\nmaintenance costs exceed 75 percent of the lowest appraisal of comparable rent, then the district must submit the information on office space rental charges in\npublicly owned buildings with its retroactive claim. (viii)\n\nMaintenance in lieu of rent must be\nrevised by the local district if there is any change in the amount of space\noccupied or if the district should occupy space in buildings other than the\nones for which the rate was originally established. (g) Care in facilities operated by\nsocial services districts. (1)\n\nCosts of\nfacilities operated by social services districts will include net actual\nexpenditures made by the social services district for the operation and\nmaintenance of the facility and capital costs described in this subdivision. Operation and maintenance may include the value of services and supplies\nfurnished by other governmental entities for consumption or use in the\nfacility, except when such services or supplies rendered the facility are a\nlegal obligation of the entity rendering the service or supplies. The value of\nindirect expenditures for services and supplies must be computed at the actual\ncost to the entity rendering them to the facility, if such cost records are\nmaintained, or, in the absence of cost records, a rate reasonably related to\ncost, but not to exceed the fair value of the supplies or services\nrendered. (2)\n\nCosts of operation\nand maintenance of facilities by social services districts may not include\ncapital costs or expenditures made for purposes not associated with the\nprovisions of care of persons authorized to be cared for in such facilities by\na social services district. Operation and maintenance costs may include\nexpenditures for: (i) personal services, consisting of employee salaries and fees for services of persons engaged in the\nmaintenance and operation of the facility and the care of residents, including\nincidental payments to residents when made pursuant to law and payments made on\nbehalf of employees to retirement funds, social security taxes, worker\ndisability compensation funds or other salary-related benefits; (ii)\nequipment, consisting of furniture and\nfurnishings, kitchen and infirmary equipment, garage and shop equipment, motor\nvehicles and passenger cars, office and service equipment, and other equipment\nnot included in capital expenditures; (iii)\nsupplies and materials, consisting of\nfood, clothing, fuel, auto, office and other supplies and materials, motor\nvehicle materials, facility workshop materials, and other materials, including\nthe wholesale value of products supplied by a farm or other production facility\noperated by the district which are consumed in the facility; and\n(iv)\nother expenses, consisting of rent for\noffice or buildings, other rents, telephone, lighting, travel, insurance, repairs to equipment, other repairs, and expenditures which are incurred for\nthe operation and maintenance of the facility. (3)\n\nCapital additions or improvements to\nfacilities may be included in costs of care provided in social services\nfacilities only when they are reimbursable. (i) Nonreimbursable expenditures. Except for\ncosts authorized in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, expenditures made for\nacquisition or development of land or for construction of, or for additions, improvements, alterations or replacements of a fixed and durable character to, buildings are not subject to reimbursement. Capital expenditures include: (a) for new construction, all the initial\nequipment, supplies and furnishings installed in the facility to begin\noperations; and\n(b) for total or\npartial conversion of a facility from domiciliary care to infirmary care, the\ncost of alterations to buildings and the cost of equipment, supplies and\nfurnishings acquired in connection with the conversion. (ii)\n\nReimbursable costs. Reimbursement may be\napproved by the department for acquiring, reconstructing, rehabilitating or\nimproving a shelter for adults, as defined in Part 491 of this Title, to the\nextent that funds are appropriated for this purpose. (a) The following conditions for\nreimbursement must be observed: (1)\n\nThe\nproposed operator must be a social services district or a not-for-profit\ncorporation or an otherwise lawfully established charitable organization or be\na governmental entity or political subdivision which has entered into a\ncontract or an agreement with a social services district for the provision of\nshelter services. (2)\n\nThe proposed\noperator must have received approval from the department pursuant to section\n485.5\nof this Title to operate a\nshelter for adults. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment must give approval prior to the acquisition, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement for which reimbursement will be sought. (b) Reimbursement, or a pro rata\nportion thereof, provided under this subparagraph will not be permitted, or\nwill be required to be returned, if the facility fails to commence operations\nwithin 18 months of approval or ceases to be operated as a certified shelter\nfor adults within a period of seven years from the date when reimbursement is\nclaimed. (c) Reimbursement, or a\npro rata portion thereof, provided under this subparagraph to a shelter other\nthan one operated by a social services district will not be permitted, or will\nbe required to be returned, if the shelter ceases to provide shelter services\nto adults under a contract or an agreement with the district within a period of\nseven years from the date such reimbursement is claimed. Any pro rata portion\nof funds attributable to a period during which the facility fails to provide\nshelter services will be required to be repaid to the department by the\noperator. (4)\n\nCosts for certain classes of care must be excluded from costs of care provided\nin facilities operated by social services districts. (i) Care not authorized under Social Services\n\nLaw. When facilities providing authorized care are also used in part to provide\nother care not authorized under the Social Services Law, the costs of such\nother care must be excluded from costs of maintenance and operation of the\nfacility when per capita daily costs are computed for the facility. Per diem\nrates will be computed periodically by the department from reports on\noperations of facilities and will be certified to social services districts\nwhen such adjustments are required to differentiate between authorized social\nservices care and other care administered in the same facility. (ii)\n\nApproved infirmary care. Care provided\neligible recipients of supplemental security income (SSI) or medical assistance\n(MA) in approved public infirmary facilities will be excluded from total costs\nof maintenance and operation of the facility when per capita daily costs are\ncomputed for the facility, or for the infirmary, if a separate rate is computed\nfor the infirmary. A social services district having an approved public\ninfirmary may use the comprehensive per diem rate established by the department\nfor the facility and the infirmary, as computed and certified annually by the\ndepartment, or request the establishment of separate rates for the infirmary\nand for the remainder of the facility by submitting a request as instructed by\nthe department. The comprehensive rate established by the department for\nfacility and infirmary care will govern unless a district properly requests\nseparate rates that are established by the department. (5)\n\nWhen computing costs of care in\nfacilities operated by social services districts, the following deductions must\nbe made: (i) Current receipts from or in\nbehalf of patients receiving care. (a) Payments for persons receiving care in facilities, including all current income\nreceived by a district for persons receiving care in the facility, but not\nincluding monies received by the district which represent recovery of\nassistance or care furnished by the district to an individual, will be applied\nagainst operation and maintenance costs of the facility. (b) Receipts for specified groups of classes\nof cases for whose care the full cost is excludable from costs of operation and\nmaintenance of the facility will not be applied as a deduction against current\noperation and maintenance costs of the facility, but will be used separately to\noffset the cost value applicable to such excluded care. (c) Receipts will also include monies\navailable for receipt by a social services district but which the district\nelects not to collect. (ii)\n\nMiscellaneous receipts from sources\nother than residents. All revenues received by social services districts in the\noperation and maintenance of a facility from sources other than residents, including proceeds from sales of obsolete equipment or materials, repayments or\nrefunds from vendors, payments by facility employees for meals and other\nmiscellaneous revenue receipts, will be applied against operation and\nmaintenance costs of the facility. (h) Assistance or care not provided in\nfacilities operated by social services districts. (1)\n\nCosts for assistance or care not provided\nin facilities operated by social services districts may include: (i) net actual expenditures properly made for\nqualified recipients to suppliers of appropriate assistance and care; and\n(ii)\nexpenditures for capital\nacquisition, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of shelters for\nadults in accordance with provisions of department regulations. (2)\n\nWhen a supplier of authorized\nhospital or other institutional care is a facility operated by a governmental\nentity and no cash transaction is involved in payment for care authorized by\nthe social services official, costs will include the value of the services\nsupplied. (i) Other\ncosts. Reimbursement will be available for administrative expenses incurred in\nrelation to: (1)\ncooperative agreements; or\n(2)\nexpenditures for foster care\nparents incurred for: (i) awards; or\n(ii)\nrecognition\ndinners.
