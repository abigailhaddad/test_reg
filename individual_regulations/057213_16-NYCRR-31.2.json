Tit. 16 § 31.2 - Evidence to be presented at hearing\n\nState Regulations\n\nAt the hearing, the applicant shall be prepared to show\nby competent evidence the facts upon which it relies to establish that the\ntransaction is in the public interest, proof of the ability of the petitioner\nto render adequate service and that the statements in the petition are\ntrue. Note: As the Public Service Law prohibits the capitalization of\nfranchises, consents or rights to engage in utility business except as provided\nin the Public Service Law, the commission will not approve a transfer or lease\nwhere it appears that the transferee or the lessee is paying for a franchise, consent or right to engage in utility business in excess of legitimate original\ncost less proper amortization. Where the amount authorized to be paid exceeds\nthe original cost less accrued depreciation of the physical property\ntransferred or leased, together with the unamortized portion of the actual cost\nincurred in securing said franchise, consent or right, the commission may\nrefuse to approve the application unless the applicant will amortize\nimmediately said excess through charges to surplus.
