  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 461.18 - Criteria for determination of significance\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn order to determine whether a proposed Type I or unlisted\naction may have a significant effect on the environment, the impacts which may\nbe reasonably expected to result from the proposed action must be compared\nagainst the criteria in this section, whether or not an EAF has been prepared. The following list is not exhaustive; however, these criteria are considered\nindicators of significant effects on the environment: (a) a substantial adverse change in existing\nair quality, water quality or noise levels; a substantial increase in solid\nwaste production; a substantial increase in potential for erosion, flooding or\ndrainage problems; (b) the removal\nor destruction of large quantities of vegetation or fauna; substantial\ninterference with the movement of any resident or migratory fish or wildlife\nspecies; impacts on a significant habitat area; or substantial adverse effects\non a threatened or endangered species of animal or plant, or the habitat of\nsuch a species; (c) the encouraging\nor attracting of a large number of people to a place or places for more than a\nfew days, compared to the number of people who would come to such place absent\nthe action; (d) the creation of a\nmaterial conflict with a community's existing plans or goals as officially\napproved or adopted; (e) the\nimpairment of the character or quality of important historical, archeological, architectural or aesthetic resources or of existing community or neighborhood\ncharacter; (f) a major change in the\nuse of either the quantity or type of energy; (g) the creation of a hazard to human health\nor safety; (h) a substantial change\nin the use, or intensity of use, of land or other natural resources or in their\ncapacity to support existing uses; (i) the creation of a material demand for\nother actions which would result in one of the above consequences; (j) changes in two or more elements of the\nenvironment, no one of which has a significant effect on the environment, but\nwhich when taken together result in a substantial adverse impact on the\nenvironment; or\n(k) two or more\nrelated actions undertaken, funded or approved by an agency, no one of which\nhas or would have a significant effect on the environment, but which\ncumulatively meet one or more of the criteria in this section. (1)\n\nFor the purpose of determining whether an\naction will cause one of the foregoing consequences, the action shall be deemed\nto include other simultaneous or subsequent actions which are: (i) included in any long-range plan of which\nthe action under consideration is a part; (ii)\nlikely to be undertaken as a result\nthereof; or\n(iii)\ndependent\nthereon. (2)\n\nThe\nsignificance of a likely consequence (i.e., whether it is material, substantial, large or important) should be assessed in connection with: (i) its setting (i.e., urban or\nrural); (ii)\nits probability of\noccurring; (iii)\nits\nduration; (iv)\nits\nirreversibility; (v) its geographic\nscope; and\n(vi)\nits\nmagnitude. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n461.18\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
