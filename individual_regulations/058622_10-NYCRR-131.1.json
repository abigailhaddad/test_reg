(v) The alteration, addition or repair of existing privies shall be allowed if constructed as outlined in the NYSDOH publication, Individual Residential Wastewater Treatment Systems Design Handbook (1996) and the criteria set forth in clause (iv)(a) or (b) of this paragraph is met, and where approval from the NYSDOH or county health department having jurisdiction is obtained. An existing privy may be allowed to remain within 300 lineal feet of the lake and/or within 100 lineal feet of the watercourse if the bottom of the pit is at least two feet above bedrock and/or maximum high groundwater and grading is such that surface water is prevented from entering the pit.
