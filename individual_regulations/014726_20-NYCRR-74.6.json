  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 74.6 - Taxes imposed on qualified reservations\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 470, 471, 471-e and 475\n(a) General. (1)\n\nQualified Indians may purchase cigarettes\nfor such qualified Indians' own use or consumption exempt from cigarette tax on\ntheir nations' or tribes' qualified reservations. However, such qualified\n\nIndians purchasing cigarettes off their reservations or on another nation's or\ntribe's reservation, and non-Indians making cigarette purchases on an Indian\nreservation are not exempt from paying the cigarette tax when purchasing\ncigarettes within this State. (2)\n\nAll cigarettes sold on an Indian reservation to non-members of the Indian\nnation or tribe and to non-Indians will be taxed, and evidence of such tax will\nbe by means of an affixed cigarette tax stamp. (3)\n\nAll cigarettes sold by agents and\nwholesale dealers to Indian nations or tribes or reservation cigarette sellers\nlocated on Indian reservations must bear a tax stamp. (4)\n\nAs provided in subdivision (b) of this\nsection, an Indian nation or tribe may elect to participate in the Indian tax\nexemption coupon system established in section\n471-e\nof the Tax Law which provides a\nmechanism for the collection of tax on cigarette sales on its qualified\nreservation to non-members of the Indian nation or tribe and to non-Indians and\nfor the delivery of quantities of tax-exempt cigarettes to the Indian nation or\ntribe for the use or consumption of the nation or tribe or by its\nmembers. (5)\n\nIf an Indian nation or\ntribe within this State does not elect to participate in the Indian tax\nexemption coupon system, the prior approval system established in section\n471 (5)\nof the Tax Law will\nbe the mechanism for the delivery of quantities of tax-exempt cigarettes to the\n\nIndian nation or tribe for the use or consumption of the nation or tribe or by\nits members as set forth in subdivision (d) of this section. (b) Election to participate\nin the Indian tax exemption coupon system. (1)\n(i) In\norder to ensure an adequate quantity of cigarettes on Indian reservations that\nmay be purchased by an Indian nation or tribe or by its members for their use\nor consumption exempt from tax, the recognized governing body of an Indian\nnation or tribe may annually elect for the 12-month period beginning September\n1st and ending August 31st to participate in the Indian tax exemption coupon\nsystem for that period. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph, such election must be made by the August 15th occurring prior\nto the start of the 12-month period. (ii)\n\nThe department may allow the recognized\ngoverning body of an Indian nation or tribe to elect to participate in the\n\nIndian tax exemption coupon system after the August 15th date prescribed in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. If the recognized governing body of an\n\nIndian nation or tribe elects to participate in the Indian tax exemption coupon\nsystem after August 15th in accordance with this subparagraph, the Indian tax\nexemption coupon system shall apply with respect to that Indian nation or tribe\nfor the remainder of the 12-month period beginning September 1st. In this case, the amount of coupons provided to the recognized governing body for the first\nquarter during which the election applies shall be reduced to account for the\nquantity of tax-exempt cigarettes sold to the Indian nation or tribe or a\nreservation cigarette seller in compliance with the prior approval system\nduring the quarter. (2)\n\nIf the recognized governing body of an Indian nation or tribe timely elects to\nparticipate in the Indian tax exemption coupon system for the 12-month period\nbeginning September 1st and ending August 31st, the Tax Department will provide\nthe Indian nation or tribe with Indian tax exemption coupons for that period as\nset forth in subdivision (c) of this section. (3)\n\nFor any 12-month period beginning\n\nSeptember 1st and ending August 31st that the recognized governing body of an\n\nIndian nation or tribe does not elect to participate in the Indian tax\nexemption coupon system by the August 15th occurring prior to the start of such\nperiod, no Indian tax exemption coupons will be provided to that Indian nation\nor tribe for that 12-month period. Instead, for that 12-month period, the prior\napproval system set forth in subdivision (d) of this section will be used to\nensure that the Indian nation or tribe can obtain cigarettes upon which the tax\nwill not be collected that are for the use or consumption of the nation or\ntribe or by its members. (c) Indian tax exemption coupon\nsystem. (1)\n\nIf the recognized governing\nbody of an Indian nation or tribe timely elects to participate in the Indian\ntax exemption coupon system for any 12-month period beginning September 1st and\nending August 31st, the Indian nation or tribe and reservation cigarette\nsellers located on the nation's or tribe's qualified reservation will be able\nto present Indian tax exemption coupons to wholesale dealers licensed under\narticle 20 of the Tax Law in order to purchase stamped cigarettes exempt from\nthe imposition of the cigarette tax. Qualified Indians may purchase cigarettes\nfrom a reservation cigarette seller on their qualified reservations exempt from\nthe cigarette tax even though such cigarettes will have an affixed cigarette\ntax stamp. (2)\n\nThe Indian tax\nexemption coupons will be provided to such governing body to ensure that the\n\nIndian nation or tribe can obtain cigarettes upon which the tax will not be\ncollected that are for the use or consumption by the nation or tribe or by its\nmembers. The Indian tax exemption coupons will be provided to the Indian nation\nor tribe on a quarterly basis for each quarter of the 12-month period that the\nnation or tribe timely elects to participate in, beginning with the first day\nof September, December, March, and June. It is intended that Indian nations or\ntribes will retain the amount of Indian tax exemption coupons they will need\neach quarter to purchase cigarettes for official nation or tribal use, and will\ndistribute the remaining Indian tax exemption coupons to reservation cigarette\nsellers on such nations' or tribes' qualified reservations. Only Indian nations\nor tribes or reservation cigarette sellers on their qualified reservations may\nredeem such Indian tax exemption coupons pursuant to this section. (3)\n\nThe amount of Indian tax exemption\ncoupons to be given to the recognized governing body of each Indian nation or\ntribe that elects to participate in the Indian tax exemption coupon system will\nbe based upon the probable demand of the qualified Indians on such nations' or\ntribe's qualified reservation plus the amount needed for official nation or\ntribal use. (4)\n\nEach Indian tax\nexemption coupon will consist of a retention portion for a wholesale dealers's\nrecordkeeping purposes and a redemption portion for a wholesale dealer's\nsubmission to the department when claiming a refund as set forth in paragraph\n(6) of this subdivision, and will contain the following information: (i) the identity of the Indian nation or\ntribe to which it is issued; (ii)\nthe identity and the quantity of the product for which it is issued; (iii)\nthe date of issuance and the date of\nexpiration; and\n(iv)\nany other\ninformation as the commissioner may deem appropriate. (5)\n\nWholesale dealers may sell only\ntax-stamped cigarettes to Indian nations and tribes, reservation cigarette\nsellers, and all other purchasers, but shall not collect the tax from any\npurchaser to the extent the purchaser gives the wholesale dealer Indian tax\nexemption coupons entitling the purchaser to purchase such quantities of\ncigarettes as allowed for on each Indian tax exemption coupon without paying\nthe tax. Any sales of stamped untaxed packages of cigarettes made by an agent\nor a wholesale dealer to an Indian nation or tribe, reservation cigarette\nseller, and all other purchasers that are not covered by Indian tax exemption\ncoupons will be made in violation of the terms of article 20 of the Tax\n\nLaw. (6)\nA wholesale dealer\nlicensed under article 20 of the Tax Law who has one or more Indian tax\nexemption coupons may file a claim for refund as provided for in Part 77 of\nthis Title with respect to any tax previously paid on cigarettes, as\nrepresented by the affixed tax stamps, it sold without collecting the tax\nbecause it accepted an Indian tax exemption coupon from its purchaser pursuant\nto this Part, except that no deduction for commissions is required. The\ndepartment will issue expedited refunds or credits to wholesale dealers under\nthe Indian tax exemption coupon system. (d) Prior approval system. (1)\n\nFor any 12-month period beginning\n\nSeptember 1st and ending August 31st that a recognized governing body of an\n\nIndian nation or tribe has not timely elected to participate in the Indian tax\nexemption coupon system, a prior approval system as set forth in this\nsubdivision and pursuant to section\n471 (5)\nof the Tax Law will\nbe used to ensure an adequate quantity of tax-exempt cigarettes on such Indian\nnation's or tribe's qualified reservation for the use or consumption of the\nnation or tribe or by its members. Under this system the Indian nation or tribe\nor a reservation cigarette seller located on its reservation will be entitled\nto purchase up to a certain number of untaxed packages of cigarettes from New\n\nYork State licensed cigarette stamping agents and wholesale dealers. Such\npackages of cigarettes will nonetheless bear an affixed cigarette tax\nstamp. (2)\n\nThe amount of stamped\nuntaxed packages of cigarettes for each Indian nation or tribe will be an\namount determined by the department based upon the probable demand of the\nqualified Indians on the nation's or tribe's qualified reservation plus the\namount needed for official nation or tribal use. (3)\n\nPrior approval as to the amount of\nstamped untaxed packages of cigarettes that agents and wholesale dealers may\nsell to Indian nations or tribes or reservation cigarette sellers must be\nobtained from the Tax Department by the agents and wholesale dealers prior to\nmaking such sales. Any sales of stamped untaxed packages of cigarettes made by\nan agent or a wholesale dealer to an Indian nation or tribe or reservation\ncigarette seller without obtaining such prior approval will be made in\nviolation of the terms of article 20 of the Tax Law. The manner and form of\nprior approval will be determined by the department, and may include the use of\nan interactive web application. (4)\nA wholesale dealer licensed under article 20 of the Tax Law may file a claim\nfor refund as provided for in Part 77 of this Title with respect to any tax, as\nrepresented by the affixed tax stamps, previously paid on cigarettes it sold\nwithout collecting the tax pursuant to this subdivision, except that no\ndeduction for commissions is required. The department will issue expedited\nrefunds or credits to wholesale dealers under the prior approval\nsystem. (e) Probable demand. (1)\n\nProbable\ndemand will be determined by reference to, among other data, the United States\naverage cigarette consumption per capita, as compiled for the most recently\ncompleted calendar or fiscal year, multiplied by the number of qualified\n\nIndians for each such affected Indian nation or tribe. Except with respect to\nthe 12-month period beginning September 1, 2010, which determination is set\nforth below, each June the Tax Department will determine the annual amount of\nstamped untaxed packages of cigarettes for each of the Indian nations or tribes\nfor the forthcoming 12-month period beginning September 1st. The annual amount\nof stamped untaxed packages of cigarettes will be determined using a probable\ndemand methodology as follows: (i) the most\nrecent U.S. Census data available on tribal populations in New York State is\nobtained and then increased by 10 percent for each Indian nation or tribe to\nallow for potential undercounting in census enumeration and for nation or\ntribal use; and\n(ii)\neach Indian\nnation's or tribe's adjusted population is then multiplied by average annual\nper capita consumption amounts, as produced annually by the Federal government, for cigarettes. The estimated annual consumption amounts for each Indian nation\nor tribe are then prorated to quarterly periods for each of the four quarters\nbeginning with the first day of September, December, March, and June. The\nquarterly consumption amounts are then rounded upward to accommodate cases of\n300 packs of 20 cigarettes. Using the methodology above for the 12-month period\nbeginning September 1, 2010, the quarterly amounts of stamped untaxed packages\nof cigarettes for each of the Indian nations or tribes for any quarterly period\nduring which these provisions apply are calculated in the table below. As\nindicated in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, these amounts are subject to\nadjustment based on evidence provided by the Indian nations or tribes as to\ntheir actual consumption amounts for these periods. Indian Nation or Tribe: NYS Population (2000 census)\n\nQuarterly Cigarette Amount\n(Packs)\n\nCayuga\n947\n20,100\n\nOneida\n1,473\n31,200\n\nOnondaga\n2,866\n60,600\n\nPoospatuck (Unkechauge)\n376\n8,100\n\nSeneca (Allegany, Cattaraugus, Oil Springs)\n7,967\n168,600\n\nShinnecock\n1,915\n40,500\n\nSt. Regis Mohawk\n13,784\n291,600\n\nTonawanda Band of Senecas\n256\n5,700\n\nTuscarora\n1,025\n21,900\n\nTotal\n30,610\n648,300\n(2)\n\nIn making a determination of probable\ndemand, the department will take into consideration any evidence submitted by\nthe recognized governing body of an Indian nation or tribe relating to such\nprobable demand (\ne.g., a verifiable record of previous sales\nto qualified Indians or other statistical evidence) and/or relating to the\namount needed for such nation's or tribe's official use. In the case of the\nannual determination made by the department in June, any such evidence\nsubmitted by July 31st will be taken into consideration and any adjustments\nwill be made prior to the 12-month period beginning September 1st to which the\ndetermination relates. (f) Tax agreements with Indian nations\nor tribes. If an Indian nation or tribe enters into an agreement\nwith New York State pursuant to section\n471 (6)\nof the Tax Law\nregarding the sale and distribution of cigarettes on the nation's or tribe's\nqualified reservation, the terms of such agreement will take precedence over\nthe provisions of this Part.
