  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 24.7 - Leaves without pay\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Leave of\nabsence; duration. A permanent employee may, in the discretion of the\nadministrative authority, be granted a leave of absence, without pay, for a\nperiod not exceeding two years. Such leave may be extended beyond two years, for periods aggregating not in excess of an additional two years. In an\nexceptional case, a further extension may be permitted for good cause shown and\nwhere the interests of the Unified Court System would be served. For the\npurposes of this Part, time spent in active service in the military forces of\nthe United States or of the State of New York shall not be considered in\ncomputing the period of leave. (b) Successive leaves of absence. Where a leave of absence without pay has been\ngranted for a period which aggregates two years, or more if extended pursuant\nto subdivision (a) of this section, a subsequent leave of absence without pay\nmay not be granted until after the employee returns to his or her position and\nserves continuously therein for six months immediately preceding the subsequent\nleave of absence. (c) Leave for\nchild care. A combined confinement and child-care leave of absence without pay\nshall be granted to an employee who becomes the parent of a child up to four\nyears of age, either by birth, or by adoption, for a period of up to 12 months, provided that effective April 1, 2024, such leave shall also be available for\nfoster placements and adoptions of children of any age. In one instance per\nemployee only, a period beyond 12 months, but not more than another successive\n12-month period, may be granted at the discretion of the administrative\nauthority, subject to the staffing needs of the court or agency. (d) A grant of leave pursuant to this section\nshall not be construed to require extension of any employment beyond the time\nat which it would otherwise terminate by operation of law, rule or\nregulation.
