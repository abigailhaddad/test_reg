  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-6.2 - State taxes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Subdivision 1 of section\n52\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law, as amended, states that \"an authority shall be exempt from\nthe payment of (a) any taxes or fees to the state or any subdivision thereof\nand (b) any fees to any officer or employee of the State or any subdivision\nthereof, except where it is provided by or pursuant to law that such officer or\nemployee is personally entitled to such fees as compensation for services\nrendered or performed by him in his official capacity.\" With the exception of\nthe State tax on gasoline (see subdivision [c] of this section), the exemption\nappears to be automatic and neither the statute nor the regulations prescribe\nprocedures for local agencies to follow with respect to the\nexemptions. (b) Fees to salaried\nand non-salaried officials. Certain officials of the State or its subdivisions, such as city marshals, do not draw salaries from the State or subdivision, but\ndepend on fees, as fixed by statute, for their compensation. Local agencies are\nnot exempt from the payment of fees to such officials. Other officials of the\n\nState or its subdivisions, such as sheriffs, are salaried officials in some\nlocalities and are non-salaried officials, depending on fees fixed by statute\nfor their compensation, in other localities. Salaried officials are not, ordinarily, personally entitled by law to the fees and the local agency is\ntherefore exempt from the payment of fees to such officials. The local agency\nshould establish the status of the officials it deals with and should pay fees\nonly to such employees of the State or its subdivisions as are personally\nentitled by law to the fees as compensation for services rendered or performed\nby them. An opinion of the State Attorney-General holds that it is proper for a\nlocal agency to pay a sheriff for \"unpredictable disbursements which may arise, such as labor employed to make an eviction\" even though the local agency would\notherwise be exempt from the payment of fees to such official. The\n\"unpredictable\" in this opinion refers to the total amount of the charge to be\nmade for the services to be rendered or performed. (c) State gasoline tax. To obtain the\nexemption from the State gasoline tax of four cents per gallon, local agencies\nmust furnish their suppliers with an exemption certificate at the end of each\nmonth. The exemption certificate is not supplied by State, but is made out by\nthe local agency, preferably on its letterhead. A specimen exemption\ncertificate is shown as Exhibit 4 of Appendix S-6. This certificate must be\ntypewritten or prepared by using ink or indelible pencil. Changes or erasures\nmay void the certification. (d) Motor vehicle license plates. Local agencies must register their motor vehicles\nand secure license plates the same as any other user of public streets and\nroads. The local agency is however, exempt from the payment of any fees in\nconnection with the registration of motor vehicles owned or operated by the\nlocal authority under subdivision 1 of section\n52\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law. The Bureau of Motor Vehicles[FN*] should stamp the\nregistration \"exempt\" so that license plates may be issued to the local\nauthority without charge. [FN*] So in original. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-6.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
