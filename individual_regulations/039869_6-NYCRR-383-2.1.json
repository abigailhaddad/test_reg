(1)\n\nAcceptance of\nwaste\nmeans the acceptance of waste for disposal after receipt and\ncompletion of inspection and examination of the waste and a determination of\ncompliance with applicable regulations and the permit. (2)\n\nAlert\nmeans a situation\nin which events may occur, are in progress, or have occurred on the disposal\nsite that could lead to a release of radioactive materials, but that the\nrelease is not expected to require a response by off-site emergency responders\nto protect individuals off the site. (3)\n\nApplicant\nmeans the\nperson applying for a permit under this Part and must be the owner of the\nproposed land disposal facility. (4)\n\nAssociated facilities\nmeans common support facilities in addition to the disposal units that are\nlocated at the disposal site and are necessary for the construction, operation, closure, and/or post-closure monitoring and maintenance of the land disposal\nfacility.
