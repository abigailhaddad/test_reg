Upon finding that\nthe government has met the standard set forth in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph with respect to some or all of the classified information at issue, the military judge shall conduct an in camera proceeding. Prior to the in\ncamera proceeding, the government shall provide the accused with notice of the\ninformation that will be at issue. This notice shall identify the classified\ninformation that will be at issue whenever that information previously has been\nmade available to the accused in connection with proceedings in the same case. The government may describe the information by generic category, in such form\nas the military judge may approve, rather than identifying the classified\ninformation when the government has not previously made the information\navailable to the accused in connection with pretrial proceedings. Following\nbriefing and argument by the parties in the in camera proceeding the military\njudge shall determine whether the information may be disclosed at the\ncourt-martial proceeding. Where the government's motion under this paragraph is\nfiled prior to the proceeding at which disclosure is sought, the military judge\nshall rule prior to the commencement of the relevant proceeding.

The accused may seek reconsideration of the determination prior to or\nduring trial. (d) Alternatives to\nfull disclosure. If the military judge makes a determination under this\nparagraph that would permit disclosure of the information or if the government\nelects not to contest the relevance, necessity, and admissibility of any\nclassified information, the government may proffer a statement admitting for\npurposes of the proceeding any relevant facts such information would tend to\nprove or may submit a portion of summary to be used in lieu of the information. The military judge shall order that such statement, portion, or summary be used\nby the accused in place of the classified information unless the military judge\nfinds that use of the classified information itself is necessary to afford the\naccused a fair trail. (e) Sanctions. If the military judge determines that alternatives to full\ndisclosure may not be used and the government continues to object to disclosure\nof the information, the military judge shall issue any order that the interests\nof justice require. Such an order may include an order: (1)\nstriking or precluding all or part of the\ntestimony of a witness; (2)\ndeclaring a mistrial; (3)\nfinding\nagainst the government on any issue as to which the evidence is relevant and\nmaterial to the defense; (4)\ndismissing the charges, with or without prejudice; or\n(5)\ndismissing the charges or specifications\nor both which the information relates.

(iv)\n\nTaking of testimony. During the\nexamination of a witness, the government may object to any question or line of\ninquiry that may require the witness to disclose classified information not\npreviously found to be relevant and necessary to the defense. Following such an\nobjection, the military judge shall take such suitable action to determine\nwhether the response is admissible as will safeguard against the compromise of\nany classified information. Such action may include requiring the government to\nprovide the military judge with a proffer of the witness' response to the\nquestion or line of inquiry and requiring the accused to provide the military\njudge with a proffer of the nature of the information the accused seeks to\nelicit. (v) Closed session. If\ncounsel for all parties, the military judge, and the members have received\nappropriate security clearances, the military judge may exclude the public\nduring that portion of the testimony of a witness that discloses classified\ninformation.

In order\nto prevent unnecessary disclosure of government information after there has\nbeen a claim of privilege under this subdivision, the military judge may order\nadmission into evidence of only part of a writing, recording, or photograph or\nmay order admission into evidence of the whole writing, recording, or\nphotograph with excision of some or all of the government information contained\ntherein. (ii)\n\nContents of writing, recording, or photograph. The military judge may permit proof of the contents\nof a writing, recording, or photograph that contains government information\nthat is the subject of a claim of privilege under this subdivision without\nrequiring introduction into evidence of the original or a duplicate. (iii)\n\nTaking of testimony. During examination\nof a witness, the prosecution may object to any question or line of inquiry\nthat may require the witness to disclose government information not previously\nfound relevant and necessary to the defense if such information has been or is\nreasonably likely to be the subject of a claim of privilege under this\nsubdivision. Following such an objection, the military judge shall take such\nsuitable action to determine whether the response is admissible as will\nsafeguard against the compromise of any government information. Such action may\ninclude requiring the government to provide the military judge with a proffer\nof the witness' response to the question or line of inquiry and requiring the\naccused to provide the military judge with a proffer of the nature of the\ninformation the accused seeks to elicit. (11)\n\nProcedures to safeguard against\ncompromise of government information disclosed to courts-martial. The Secretary\nof Defense may prescribe procedures for protection against the compromise of\ngovernment information submitted to courts-martial and appellate authorities\nafter a claim of privilege. (g) Identity of informant. (1)\n\nRule of privilege. The United States or a\nstate or subdivision thereof has a privilege to refuse to disclose the identity\nof an informant. An informant is a person who has furnished information\nrelating to or assisting in an investigation of a possible violation of law to\na person whose official duties include the discovery, investigation, or\nprosecution of crime. Unless otherwise privileged under these rules, the\ncommunications of an informant are not privileged except to the extent\nnecessary to prevent disclosure of the informant's identity. (2)\n\nWho may claim the privilege. The\nprivilege may be claimed by an appropriate representative of the State, regardless of whether information was furnished to an officer of the United\n\nStates or a state or subdivision thereof. The privilege may be claimed by an\nappropriate representative of a state or subdivision if the information was\nfurnished to an officer thereof, except the privilege shall not be allowed if\nthe prosecution objects. (3)\n\nExceptions. (i) Voluntary disclosures; informant as witness. No privilege exists under this subdivision: (a) if the identity of the informant has been\ndisclosed to those who would have caused to resent the communication by a\nholder of the privilege or by the informant's own action; or\n(b) if the informant appears as a witness for\nthe prosecution. (ii)\n\nTestimony on the issue of guilt or innocence. If a claim of privilege has been\nmade under this subdivision, the military judge shall, upon motion by the\naccused, determine whether disclosure of the identity of the informant is\nnecessary to the accused's defense on the issue of guilt or innocence. Whether\nsuch a necessity exists will depend on the particular circumstances of each\ncase, taking into consideration the offense charge, the possible defense, the\npossible significance of the informant's testimony, and other relevant factors. If it appears from the evidence in the case or from other showing by a party\nthat an informant may be able to give testimony necessary to the accused's\ndefense on the issue of guilt or innocence, the military judge may make any\norder required by the interests of justice. (iii)\n\nLegality of obtaining evidence. If a\nclaim of privilege has been made under this subdivision with respect to a\nmotion under Mil. R. Evid. 311, the military judge shall, upon motion of the\naccused, determine whether disclosure of the identity of the informant is\nrequired by the Constitution of the United States, or the State of New York as\napplied to members of the Armed Forces. In making this determination, the\nmilitary judge may make any order required by the interests of\njustice. (4)\n\nProcedures. If a claim of privilege has been made under this subdivision, the military\njudge may make any order required by the interests of justice. If the military\njudge determines that disclosure of the identity of the informant is required\nunder the standards set forth in this subdivision, and the prosecution elects\nnot to disclose the identity of the informant, the matter shall be reported to\nthe convening authority. The convening authority may institute action to secure\ndisclosure of the identity of the informant, terminate the proceedings, or take\nsuch other action as may be appropriate under the circumstances. If, after a\nreasonable period of time disclosure is not made, the military judge, sua\nsponte or upon motion of either counsel and after a hearing if requested by\neither party, may dismiss the charge or specifications or both to which the\ninformation regarding the informant would relate if the military judge\ndetermines that further proceedings would materially prejudice a substantial\nright of the accused. (h) Political vote. A person has a privilege\nto refuse to disclose the tenor of the person's vote at a political election\nconducted by secret ballot unless the vote was cast illegally. (i) Deliberations of courts and juries. Except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 606, the deliberations of courts and grand\nand petit juries are privileged to the extent that such matters are privileged\nin trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but the\nresults of the deliberations are not privileged. (j) Waiver of privilege by voluntary\ndisclosure. (1)\nA person upon whom these rules\nconfer a privilege against disclosure of a confidential matter or communication\nwaives the privilege if the person or person's predecessor while holder of the\nprivilege voluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant\npart of the matter or communication under such circumstances that it would be\ninappropriate to allow the claim of privilege. This subdivision does not apply\nif the disclosure is itself a privileged communication. (2)\n\nUnless testifying voluntarily concerning\na privileged matter or communication, an accused who testifies in his or her\nown behalf or a person who testifies under a grant or promise of immunity does\nnot, merely by reason of testifying, waive a privilege to which he or she may\nbe entitled pertaining to the confidential matter or communication. (k) Privileged matter disclosed\nunder compulsion or without opportunity to claim privilege. (1)\n\nEvidence of a statement or other\ndisclosure of privileged matter is not admissible against the holder of the\nprivilege if disclosure was compelled erroneously or was made without an\nopportunity for the holder of the privilege to claim the privilege. (2)\n\nThe telephonic transmission of\ninformation otherwise privileged under these rules does not affect its\nprivileged character. Use of electronic means of communication other than the\ntelephone for transmission of information otherwise privileged under these\nrules does not affect the privileged character of such information if use of\nsuch means of communication is necessary and in furtherance of the\ncommunication. (l) Comment upon or inference from claim of privilege; instruction. (1)\n\nComment or inference not permitted. (i) The claim of a privilege by the accused\nwhether in the present proceeding or upon a prior occasion is not a proper\nsubject of comment by the military judge or counsel for any party. No inference\nmay be drawn therefrom. (ii)\n\nThe\nclaim of a privilege by a person other than the accused whether in the present\nproceeding or upon a prior occasion normally is not a proper subject of comment\nby the military judge or counsel for any party. An adverse inference may not be\ndrawn therefrom except when determined by the military judge to be required by\nthe interests of justice. (2)\n\nClaiming privilege without knowledge of\nmembers. In a trial before a court-martial with members, proceedings shall be\nconducted, to the extent practicable, so as to facilitate the making of claims\nof privilege without the knowledge of the members. This paragraph does not\napply to a special court- martial without a military judge. (3)\n\nInstruction. Upon request, any party\nagainst whom the members might draw an adverse inference from a claim of\nprivilege is entitled to an instruction that no inference may be drawn\ntherefrom except as provided in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this\nsubdivision.
