  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 §§ 271-5.4 - Mechanical cleaning and sanitizing\n\nState Regulations\n\nFacilities and/or equipment shall be available, either in\na servicing area or in place, to provide for proper cleaning and sanitizing of\nall food-contact surfaces including product modules, lids and dispensing\nutensils. Mechanical cleaning and sanitizing equipment and practices shall\nconform to the following requirements: (a) Cleaning and sanitizing may be done by\nspray-type or immersion dishwashing machines or by any other type of machine or\ndevice if it is demonstrated that it thoroughly cleans and sanitizes equipment\nand utensils. These machines and devices shall be properly installed and\nmaintained in good repair. Machines and devices shall be operated in accordance\nwith manufacturers' instructions, and utensils and equipment placed in the\nmachine shall be exposed to all dishwashing cycles. Automatic detergent\ndispensers, wetting agent dispensers and liquid sanitizer injectors, if any, shall be properly installed and maintained. (b) The pressure of final rinse water\nsupplied to spray-type dishwashing machines shall not be less than 15 nor more\nthan 25 pounds per square inch measured in the water line immediately adjacent\nto the final rinse control valve. A 1/4 inch IPS valve shall be provided\nimmediately upstream from the final rinse control valve to permit checking the\nflow pressure of the final rinse water. (c) Machine or waterline mounted numerically\nscaled indicating thermometers, accurate to plus or minus 3°F, shall be\nprovided to indicate the temperature of the water in each tank of the machine\nand the temperature of the final rinse water as it enters the\nmanifold. (d) Rinse water tanks\nshall be protected by baffles, curtains or other effective means to minimize\nthe entry of wash water into the rinse water. Conveyors in dishwashing machines\nshall be accurately timed to assure proper exposure times in wash and rinse\ncycles in accordance with manufacturers' specifications attached to the\nmachines. (e) Drain boards shall be\nprovided and be of adequate size for the proper handling of soiled utensils\nprior to washing and of cleaned utensils following sanitization and shall be so\nlocated and constructed as not to interfere with the proper use of the\ndishwashing facilities. This does not preclude the use of easily movable dish\ntables for the storage of soiled utensils or the use of easily movable dish\ntables for the storage of clean utensils following sanitization. (f) Equipment and utensils shall be flushed\nor scraped and, when necessary, soaked to remove gross food particles and soil\nprior to being washed in a dishwashing machine unless a prewash cycle is a part\nof the dishwashing machine operation. Equipment and utensils shall be placed in\nracks, trays or baskets, or on conveyors, in a way that food-contact surfaces\nare exposed to the unobstructed application of detergent wash and clean rinse\nwaters and that permits free draining. (g) Machines (single-tank, stationary-rack, door-type machines and spray-type glass washers) using chemicals for\nsanitization may be used, provided that: (1)\nthe temperature of the wash water shall not be less than 120°F; (2)\nthe wash water shall be kept\nclean; (3)\nchemicals added for\nsanitization purposes shall be automatically dispensed; (4)\nutensils and equipment shall be exposed\nto the final chemical sanitizing rinse in accordance with manufacturers'\nspecifications for time and concentration; (5)\nthe chemical sanitizing rinse water\ntemperature shall not be less than 75°F nor less than the temperature specified\nby the machine's manufacturer; (6)\nchemical sanitizers used shall meet the requirements of title 21 of the\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, section 178.1010, (revised as of\n\nApril 1, 2013), pages 362-371, published by the Office of the Federal Register\nand available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing\n\nOffice, Washington, DC 20402; and\n(7)\na test kit or other device that\naccurately measures the parts per million concentration of the solution shall\nbe available and used. (h) Machines using hot water for sanitizing\nmay be used provided that wash water and pumped rinse water shall be kept clean\nand water shall be maintained at not less than the temperature stated in\nsubdivision (g) of this section. (1)\n\nSingle-tank, stationary-rack, dual temperature machine: Wash temperature 150°F..................................................................... Final rinse temperature 180°F.............................................................. (2)\n\nSingle-tank, stationary-rack, single-temperature machine: Wash temperature 165°F..................................................................... Final rinse temperature 165°F.............................................................. (3)\n\nSingle-tank, conveyor machine: Wash temperature 160°F..................................................................... Final rinse temperature 180°F.............................................................. (4)\n\nMultitank, conveyor machine: Wash temperature 150°F..................................................................... Pumped rinse temperature 160°F........................................................ Final rinse temperature 180°F.............................................................. (5)\n\nSingle-tank, pot, pan, and utensil washer\n(either stationary or moving-rack): Wash temperature 140°F..................................................................... Final rinse temperature 180°F.............................................................. (i) All dishwashing machines shall be\nthoroughly cleaned at least once a day or more often when necessary to maintain\nthem in a satisfactory operating condition. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
