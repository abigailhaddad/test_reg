  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 622.11 - Evidence, burden of proof and standard of proof\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Evidence.'\n(1)\n\nBefore testifying, each witness must be\nsworn or make an affirmation. (2)\n\nIn order to ensure a fair and efficient hearing process, the ALJ may limit the\nrepetitious examination or cross-examination of witnesses or the amount of\ncorroborative or cumulative testimony. (3)\n\nThe rules of evidence need not be\nstrictly applied; provided, however, the ALJ will give effect to the rules of\nprivilege recognized by New York State law. (4)\n\nEvery party has the right to present\nevidence and cross-examine witnesses. (5)\n\nOfficial notice may be taken of all facts\nof which judicial notice could be taken and of other facts within the\nspecialized knowledge of the department. When official notice is taken of a\nmaterial fact not appearing in the evidence in the record and of which judicial\nnotice could not be taken, every party must be given notice thereof and must on\ntimely request be afforded an opportunity prior to the final order of the\ncommissioner to dispute the fact or its materiality. (6)\n\nHearsay. The proponents of hearsay\nevidence must demonstrate that the evidence offered falls within one of the\nfollowing exceptions: (i) Any writing or\nrecord, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a\nmemorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence or event, if the ALJ\nfinds that it was made in the regular course of any business and that it was\nthe regular course of the business to make it, at the time of the act, transaction, occurrence or event, or within a reasonable time thereafter. All\nother circumstances of the making of the memorandum or record, including lack\nof personal knowledge by the maker, may be proved to affect its weight, but\nwill not affect its admissibility. The term business includes a business, profession, occupation and calling of every kind; (ii)\n\nWhere a public officer is required or\nauthorized by special provision of law, to make a certificate or an affidavit\nto a fact ascertained, or an act performed by the officer in the course of the\nofficer's official duty, and to file or deposit it in a public office of the\n\nState, the certificate or affidavit so filed or deposited is prima facie\nevidence of the facts stated; (iii)\nA statement signed by an officer or a qualified agent or representative having\nlegal custody of specified official records of the United States or of any\nstate, county, town, village or city or of any court thereof, or kept in any\npublic office thereof, that a diligent search of the records was made and no\nrecord or entry of a specified nature was found, is prima facie evidence that\nthe records contain no such record or entry, but only if the statement is\naccompanied by a certification that legal custody of the specified official\nrecords belongs to that person. The certification must be made by a person\ndescribed in CPLR 4540; (iv)\n\nAll\nmaps, surveys and official records affecting real property, which are on file\nin the State in the office of the registrar of any county, any county clerk, any court of record or any department of the State or City of New York are\nprima facie evidence of their contents; (v) All written statements, charts, tabulations and similar data offered in evidence at the hearing, upon a showing\nthat the evidence offered is reliable, relevant and probative; (vi)\n\nExceptions provided by CPLR Article 45\nor other law; or\n(vii)\n\nThe evidence\noffered is shown to be reliable, relevant and probative. (7)\n\nBy permission of the ALJ, samples may be\ndisplayed at the hearing and may be described for purposes of the record, but\nneed not be admitted in evidence as exhibits. (8)\n\nWhere the testimony of a witness refers\nto a statute, a report or a document, the ALJ must, after being satisfied of\nthe identity of the statute, report or document, determine whether it will be\nproduced at the hearing and physically made a part of the record or if it will\nbe incorporated in the record by reference. (b) 'Burden of proof.'\n(1)\n\nDepartment staff bears the burden of\nproof on all violations alleged and matters affirmatively asserted in the\ndocument that commenced the proceeding. (2)\n\nRespondent bears the burden of proof\nregarding all affirmative defenses. (3)\n\nThe party making a motion bears the\nburden of proof on that motion. (c) 'Standard of proof.' Whenever factual\nmatters are involved, the party bearing the burden of proof must sustain that\nburden by a preponderance of the evidence unless a higher standard has been\nestablished by statute or regulation. This subdivision does not modify or\nsupplement the questions that may be raised in a proceeding brought pursuant to\nCPLR Article 78. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
