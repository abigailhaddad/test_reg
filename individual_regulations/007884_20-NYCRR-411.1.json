  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 411.1 - Registration of distributors\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 283(1), (3), (5)\n(a) Any person who or which imports or causes\nto be imported into this State motor fuel for use, distribution, storage or\nsale within this State, or who or which produces, refines, manufactures or\ncompounds motor fuel within this State is a distributor and must be registered\nwith the Department of Taxation and Finance as a distributor of motor fuels. Unless so registered, no person may (1) import motor fuel or cause motor fuel\nto be imported into New York State for use, distribution, storage or sale\nwithin the State; or (2) produce, refine, manufacture or compound motor fuel in\nthis State. Further, no distributor unless so registered may make any sale, transfer, use or other disposition of motor fuel within the State, except a\nsale, transfer, use or other disposition, if any, as to which the State cannot\nrequire registration as a prerequisite by reason of the United States\n\nConstitution and any laws enacted pursuant thereto. (b) Before any person may be registered as a\ndistributor of motor fuel, such person must submit to the department: (1)\na completed application for registration\nas a distributor of motor fuel (form TP-128.3); (2)\ncurrent unqualified financial statements\ncertified by a certified public accountant pursuant to an audit conducted by\nsuch accountant; and\n(3)\nan\nestimate of the monthly number of gallons of motor fuel expected to be: (i) imported or caused to be imported into\nthe State for use, distribution, storage or sale within the State; (ii)\nproduced, refined, manufactured or\ncompounded within the State; and\n(iii)\nsold, transferred, used or otherwise\ndistributed within the State. (c) The department (in order to protect\narticle 12-A-revenues, and articles 28 and 29-revenues with respect to motor\nfuel) will periodically review the financial status of registered distributors\nand may, at any time subsequent to registration of any person as a distributor, require any such distributor to submit to the department: (1)\ncompleted motor fuel distributor\ninformational reports; and\n(2)\ncurrent unqualified financial statements certified by a certified public\naccountant pursuant to an audit conducted by such accountant. (d) (1)\n\nCurrent unqualified financial\nstatements\nas used in this Part means unqualified financial statements\nfor a 12-month period of time ended not more than 18 months prior to the date\nsuch statements are submitted to the department. Where such unqualified\nfinancial statements are for a period ended more than six months prior to the\ndate of submission, in addition to such unqualified financial statements, interim financial statements (on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis) must be\nsubmitted to the department for a period of time ending within such six-month\nperiod. All financial statements submitted to the department must reflect the\nindividual activities of the applicant or of the distributor, as the case may\nbe. Where an unqualified certification is applicable to a consolidated group of\nentities, the financial spreadsheets upon which the certification was based, together with an analysis of all intercompany accounts, must also be\nprovided. (2)\n\nGenerally, if an\napplicant or distributor fails to supply current unqualified financial\nstatements as required by subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, the\napplicant will not be registered or such distributor's registration will be\ncancelled. However, on petition, either through the hearing process or on the\nmotion of the department, the requirement of submitting unqualified financial\nstatements may be waived. If such requirement is waived, the applicant or\ndistributor will be required to file a bond or deposit acceptable security in\nsuch amount as is deemed appropriate, regardless of the net worth or financial\nstatus of the applicant or distributor. (e) (1)\nA\ndistributor must immediately inform the Department of Taxation and Finance, in\nwriting, of any change in its address. Additionally, a distributor which is a\ncorporation or a partnership must immediately inform the department, in\nwriting, of any changes in such distributor's officers, directors or partners\nor any changes in such persons' addresses as shown in the distributor's\napplication for registration. (2)\n\nWhen shares of stock are acquired by any person such that a distributor which\nhad four or fewer shareholders owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, the voting stock of such distributor upon such acquisition has more than four\nshareholders so owning or controlling such stock, the distributor must\nimmediately file a notification of such acquisitions with the department. However, if in any such acquisitions, a person not previously owning or\ncontrolling, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the shares of\nvoting stock of such distributor acquires shares of stock such that the person\nowns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the shares of\nvoting stock of such distributor, such acquisition is a transfer of\nregistration subject to the provisions of section\n411.8\nof\nthis Part.
