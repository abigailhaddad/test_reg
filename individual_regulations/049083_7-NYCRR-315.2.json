  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 315.2 - Admissions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon placement of an incarcerated individual\ninto a residential rehabilitation unit, they shall be assessed as follows: (1)\nat a level one or level two facility, a\nsuicide prevention screening instrument shall be administered by staff from the\ndepartment, or the office of mental health, who has been trained for that purpose. If such a screening instrument reveals that the incarcerated individual is at risk\nof suicide, a mental health clinician shall be consulted, and appropriate safety\nprecautions shall be taken. Additionally, within one business day of the placement\nof such an incarcerated individual into a residential rehabilitation unit at a level\none or level two facility, the incarcerated individual shall be assessed by a mental\nhealth clinician. (2)\nat a level three\nor level four facility, a suicide prevention screening instrument shall be\nadministered by staff from the department or the office of mental health who has\nbeen trained for that purpose. If such a screening instrument reveals that the\nincarcerated individual is at risk of suicide, a mental health clinician shall be\nconsulted, and appropriate safety precautions shall be taken. All incarcerated\nindividuals placed in a residential rehabilitation unit at a level three or level\nfour facility shall be assessed by a mental health clinician, within seven days of\nsuch placement into segregated confinement. (3)\nat the initial assessment, if the mental\nhealth clinician finds that an incarcerated individual suffers from a serious mental\nillness, as defined in Correction Law Section 137(6)(e), that person shall be\ndiverted or removed from segregated confinement or a residential rehabilitation unit\nand a recommendation shall be made whether exceptional circumstances exist, as\ndescribed in paragraph (5) of this subdivision. (i) In a facility with a joint case management\ncommittee, such recommendation shall be made by such committee. In a facility\nwithout a joint case management committee, the recommendation shall be made jointly\nby a committee consisting of the facility's highest ranking mental health clinician, the deputy superintendent for security, and the deputy superintendent for program\nservices or their equivalents. (ii)\n\nAny\nsuch recommendation shall be reviewed by the joint central office review committee. The administrative process described in this clause shall be completed within seven\ndays of the initial assessment, and if the result of such process is that the\nincarcerated individual should be removed from segregated confinement or a\nresidential rehabilitation unit, such removal shall occur as soon as practicable, but in no event more than seventy-two hours from the completion of the\nadministrative process. (iii)\n\nNothing in\nthis section shall permit the placement of an incarcerated person with serious\nmental illness into segregated confinement at any time, even for the purposes of\nassessment. (4)\n\nIf an\nincarcerated individual with serious mental illness is not diverted or removed to a\nresidential mental health treatment unit, such incarcerated individual shall be\ndiverted to a residential rehabilitation unit and reassessed by a mental health\nclinician within fourteen days of the initial assessment and at least once every\nfourteen days thereafter. After each such additional assessment, a recommendation as\nto whether such incarcerated individual should be removed from residential\nrehabilitation unit shall be made and reviewed according to the process set forth in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. (5)\nA\nrecommendation or determination whether to remove an incarcerated individual from a\nresidential rehabilitation unit shall take into account the assessing mental health\nclinician's opinions as to the incarcerated individual's mental condition and\ntreatment needs, and shall also take into account any safety and security concerns\nthat would be posed by the incarcerated individual's removal, even if additional\nrestrictions were placed on the incarcerated individual's access to treatment, property, services, or privileges in a residential mental health treatment unit. A\nrecommendation or determination shall direct the incarcerated individual's removal\nfrom segregated confinement or a residential rehabilitation unit except in the\nfollowing exceptional circumstances: (i) when the\nreviewer finds that removal would pose a substantial risk to the safety of the\nincarcerated individual or other persons, or a substantial threat to the security of\nthe facility, even if additional restrictions were placed on the incarcerated\nindividual's access to treatment, property, services, or privileges in a residential\nmental health treatment unit; or\n(ii)\nwhen the assessing mental health clinician determines that such placement is in the\nincarcerated individual's best interests based on their mental condition and that\nremoving such incarcerated individual to a residential mental health treatment unit\nwould be detrimental to their mental condition. Any determination not to remove an\nincarcerated individual with serious mental illness from a residential\nrehabilitation unit shall be documented in writing and include the reasons for the\ndetermination. (6)\n\nIncarcerated individuals with serious mental illness who are not diverted or removed\nfrom a residential rehabilitation unit shall be offered a heightened level of mental\nhealth care, involving a minimum of three hours daily of out-of-cell therapeutic\ntreatment and programming. This heightened level of care shall not be offered only\nin the following circumstances: (i) The heightened\nlevel of care shall not apply when an incarcerated individual with serious mental\nillness does not, in the reasonable judgment of a mental health clinician, require\nthe heightened level of care. Such determination shall be documented with a written\nstatement of the basis of such determination and shall be reviewed by the Central\n\nNew York Psychiatric Center clinical director or their designee. Such a\ndetermination is subject to change should the incarcerated individual's clinical\nstatus change. Such determination shall be reviewed and documented by a mental\nhealth clinician every thirty days, and in consultation with the Central New York\n\nPsychiatric Center clinical director or their designee not less than every ninety\ndays. (ii)\n\nThe heightened level of care\nshall not apply in exceptional circumstances when providing such care would create\nan unacceptable risk to the safety and security of incarcerated individuals or\nstaff. Such determination shall be documented by security personnel together with\nthe basis of such determination and shall be reviewed by the facility\nsuperintendent, in consultation with a mental health clinician, not less than every\nseven days for as long as the incarcerated individual remains in a residential\nrehabilitation unit. The facility shall attempt to resolve such exceptional\ncircumstances so that the heightened level of care may be provided. If such\nexceptional circumstances remain unresolved for thirty days, the matter shall be\nreferred to the joint central office review committee for review. (7)\n\nAll incarcerated individuals in a\nresidential rehabilitation unit in a level one or level two facility who are not\nassessed with a serious mental illness at the initial assessment shall be offered at\nleast one interview with a mental health clinician within seven days of their\ninitial mental health assessment unless the mental health clinician at the most\nrecent interview recommends an earlier interview or assessment. All incarcerated\nindividuals in a residential rehabilitation unit in a level three or level four\nfacility who are not assessed with a serious mental illness at the initial\nassessment shall be offered at least one interview with a mental health clinician\nwithin thirty days of their initial mental health assessment, and additional\ninterviews at least every ninety days thereafter, unless the mental health clinician\nat the most recent interview recommends an earlier interview or\nassessment. (b) All\nresidential rehabilitation units shall create the least restrictive environment\nnecessary for the safety of incarcerated persons, staff, and the security of the\nfacility. (1)\n\nIncarcerated individuals placed in a\nresidential rehabilitation unit shall be offered at least six hours of daily\nout-of-cell congregate programming, services, treatment, and/or meals, with an\nadditional minimum of one hour for recreation. Recreation in all residential\nrehabilitation units shall take place in a congregate setting, unless exceptional\ncircumstances mean doing so would create a significant and unreasonable risk to the\nsafety and security of other incarcerated persons, staff, or the facility. Persons\nin residential rehabilitation units shall be offered programming and out-of-cell\ntime pursuant to directive(s). (2)\n\nNo\nlimitation on services, treatment, or basic needs such as clothing, food, and\nbedding shall be imposed as a form of punishment. If provision of any such services, treatment, or basic needs to an individual would create a significant and\nunreasonable risk to the safety and security of incarcerated persons, staff, or the\nfacility, such services, treatment, or basic needs may be withheld until it\nreasonably appears that the risk has ended. The department shall not impose\nrestricted diets or any other change in diet as a form of punishment. Persons in a\nresidential rehabilitation unit shall have access to all of their personal property\nunless an individual determination is made that having a specific item would pose a\nsignificant and unreasonable risk to the safety of incarcerated persons or staff or\nthe security of the unit. (3)\n\nUpon\nadmission to a residential rehabilitation unit, program and mental health staff\nshall administer assessments and develop an individual rehabilitation plan in\nconsultation with the resident, based upon their medical, mental health, and\nprogramming needs. Such plan shall identify specific goals and programs, treatment, and services to be offered, with projected time frames for completion and discharge\nfrom the residential rehabilitation unit. (4)\n\nAn incarcerated person in a residential\nrehabilitation unit shall have access to programs and work assignments comparable to\ncore programs and types of work assignments in general population. Such incarcerated\npersons shall also have access to additional out-of-cell, trauma-informed\ntherapeutic programming aimed at promoting personal development, addressing\nunderlying causes of problematic behavior resulting in placement in a residential\nrehabilitation unit, and helping prepare for discharge from the unit and to the\ncommunity. (5)\n\nIf the department\nestablishes that a person committed an act defined in Correction Law Section\n137(6)(k)(ii) while in a residential rehabilitation unit and poses a significant and\nunreasonable risk to the safety and security of other incarcerated persons or staff, the department may restrict such person's participation in programming and\nout-of-cell activities as necessary for the safety of other incarcerated persons and\nstaff. (i) If such restrictions are imposed, the\ndepartment must provide at least four hours out-of-cell time daily, including at\nleast two hours of therapeutic programming and two hours of recreation, and must\nmake reasonable efforts to reinstate access to programming as soon as possible. In\nno case may such restrictions extend beyond fifteen days unless the person commits a\nnew act defined herein justifying restrictions on program access, or if the\ncommissioner and, when appropriate, the commissioner of mental health personally\nreasonably determine that the person poses an extraordinary and unacceptable risk of\nimminent harm to the safety or security of incarcerated persons or staff. (ii)\n\nAny extension of program restrictions beyond\nfifteen days must be meaningfully reviewed and approved at least every fifteen days\nby the commissioner and, when appropriate, by the commissioner of mental health. Each review must consider the impact of therapeutic programming provided during the\nfifteen-day period on the person's risk of imminent harm and the commissioner must\narticulate in writing, with a copy provided to the incarcerated person, the specific\nreason why the person currently poses an extraordinary and unacceptable risk of\nimminent harm to the safety or security of incarcerated persons or staff. In no case\nmay restrictions imposed by the commissioner extend beyond ninety days unless the\nperson commits a new act defined herein justifying restrictions on program\naccess. (6)\n\nRestraints shall\nnot be used when incarcerated persons are participating in out-of-cell activities\nwithin a residential rehabilitation unit unless an individual assessment is made\nthat restraints are required because of a significant and unreasonable risk to the\nsafety and security of other incarcerated persons or staff. (c) Any sanction imposed on an incarcerated person\nrequiring segregated confinement shall run while the person is in a residential\nrehabilitation unit and the person shall be discharged from the unit before or at\nthe time such sanction expires. If a person successfully completes their\nrehabilitation plan before the sanction expires, the person shall have a right to be\ndischarged from the unit upon such completion. (1)\n\nIf an incarcerated person has not been discharged from a residential rehabilitation\nunit within one year of initial admission to such a unit or is within sixty days of\na fixed or tentatively approved date for release from a correctional facility, they\nshall have a right to be discharged from the unit unless they committed an act\nlisted in Correction Law Section 137(k)(ii) within the prior one hundred eighty days\nand they pose a significant and unreasonable risk to the safety or security of\nincarcerated persons or staff. In any such case the decision not to discharge such\nperson shall be immediately and automatically subjected to an independent review by\nthe commissioner and the commissioner of mental health or their designees. A person\nmay remain in a residential rehabilitation unit beyond the time limits provided in\nthis section if both commissioners, or both of their designees, approve this\ndecision. In extraordinary circumstances, a person who has not committed an act\nlisted in Correction Law Section 137(6)(k)(ii) within the prior one hundred eighty\ndays, may remain in a residential rehabilitation unit beyond the time limits\nprovided in this section if both the commissioner and the commissioner of mental\nhealth personally determine that such individual poses an extraordinary and\nunacceptable risk of imminent harm to the safety or security of incarcerated persons\nor staff. (2)\n\nThere shall be a\nmeaningful periodic review of the status of each incarcerated person in a\nresidential rehabilitation unit at least every sixty days to assess the person's\nprogress and determine if the person should be discharged from the unit. Following\nsuch periodic review, if the person is not discharged from the unit, program and\nmental health staff shall specify in writing the reasons for the determination and\nthe program, treatment, service, and/or corrective action required before discharge. The incarcerated person shall be given access to the programs, treatment, and\nservices specified, and shall have a right to be discharged from the residential\nrehabilitation unit upon the successful fulfillment of such requirements. (3)\n\nWhen an incarcerated person is discharged from\na residential rehabilitation unit, any remaining time to serve on any underlying\ndisciplinary sanction shall be dismissed. If an incarcerated person substantially\ncompletes their rehabilitation plan, they shall have any associated loss of good\ntime restored upon discharge from the unit. (d) All residential rehabilitation unit staff and\ntheir supervisors shall undergo specialized training prior to assignment to such\nunit, and regular specialized training thereafter, on substantive content developed\nin consultation with relevant experts, on topics including, but not limited to, the\npurpose and goals of the non-punitive therapeutic environment, trauma-informed care, restorative justice, and dispute resolution methods. (e) The department shall publish monthly reports\non its website, with semi-annual and annual cumulative reports, of the total number\nof people who are in segregated confinement and the total number of people who are\nin residential rehabilitation units on the first day of each month. The reports\nshall provide a breakdown of the number of people in segregated confinement and in\nresidential rehabilitation units by: (1)\nage; (2)\nrace; (3)\ngender; (4)\nmental health treatment level; (5)\nspecial health accommodations or\nneeds; (6)\nneed for and participation in\nsubstance use disorder programs; (7)\npregnancy status; (8)\ncontinuous length\nof stay in residential treatment units as well as length of stay in the past sixty\ndays; (9)\nnumber of days in segregated\nconfinement; (10)\na list of all\nincidents resulting in sanctions of segregated confinement by facility and date of\noccurrence; (11)\n\nNumber of incarcerated\npersons in segregated confinement by facility; and\n(12)\nthe number of incarcerated persons in\nresidential rehabilitation units by facility.
