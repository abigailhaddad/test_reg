  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 483.3 - Redetermination of hazardous waste program fees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The annual program fee determined for the\ncurrent calendar year is an estimated fee based upon the fee determined for the\npreceding calendar year. Once the current calendar year ends on December 31st, it may be necessary for the department to redetermine the fee based upon\nwhether the actual amounts of hazardous waste generated or received by each\nregulated entity were overestimated or underestimated. (b) A person having to pay an annual program\nfee may request that the annual program fee for that calendar year be\nredetermined based upon the actual volume of hazardous waste generated or\nreceived during that calendar year. This request must be made under the\nprovisions of section\n481.9\nof this Title, except that\ntime limits are extended as provided in section\n481.4\nof this Title. (c) The department may change a program fee\nfor a calendar year at any time during that calendar year or within the next\nthree calendar years. (d) If a\nperson wants to challenge the correctness of the department's change, that\nperson must follow the procedures set forth in section\n481.9\nof this Title. (e) If the department finds that the person\noverpaid an annual program fee due for that calendar year, the department will\nrefund or credit the amount of that overpayment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n483.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
