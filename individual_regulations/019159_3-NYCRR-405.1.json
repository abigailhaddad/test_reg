Tit. 3 § 405.1 - Books and records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Until payment in full, every licensee\nshall file each premium finance agreement or duplicate originals, thereof, and\nall original documents relating thereto (except those papers returned to the\ninsured) so as to be readily available for inspection at any time. All such\npapers and instruments shall bear a common identifying number. (b) Every insurance premium finance agreement\nwhich originates with a broker or agent shall contain a statement of the amount\nof the charge under Insurance Law, section 2119, and a statement as to the\nservices for which such charge is made. A statement that \"the services for\nwhich the charge pursuant to Insurance Law, section 2119, is imposed are in\nconnection with obtaining and servicing the policies listed hereon\" will\nnormally suffice. If such charge is not being financed, the amount thereof, if\nany, need not be set forth in the calculations required under Banking Law, section 567(3)(b), but may be set forth separately in the agreement with an\nappropriate indication that it is not being financed. An insurance premium\nfinance agreement which does not originate with an agent or broker need not\ncontain such statement unless the charge pursuant to Insurance Law, section\n2119, is being financed. Unless such premium finance agreement contains a\nstatement with respect to such charge, every premium finance agency, as defined\nin Banking Law, section 554(7), shall obtain from the insured at the time of\nentering into the premium finance agreement a separate statement, to be signed\nby the insured, stating that the insured has paid no such charge, or if such\ncharge has been paid, the amount thereof. Nothing herein contained shall be\nconstrued to impose any duty upon a premium finance agency to verify whether a\ncharge pursuant to Insurance Law, section 2119, has been imposed or, if so\nimposed the amount thereof or the reasons therefor. (c) Every licensee shall maintain a register, ledger or combination of records containing a summary of premium finance\nagreements acquired, other than pursuant to a pledge, which can readily show; (1)\nthe date of acquisition; (2)\nthe name of the insured; (3)\nthe identifying number; (4)\nthe principal balance; (5)\nthe amount of service charge; (6)\nthe time balance; (7)\na distribution of proceeds showing the\ndates, amounts, purposes and names of the person to whom any part of the\nproceeds is distributed. The record shall also show the application of any part of\nthe proceeds to an unpaid balance due on an existing premium finance agreement\nwhich is terminated by a refinance agreement. For the purpose of this Part, the\ntime balance shall mean the sum of the principal balance plus the amount of the\nservice charge. (d) Every licensee shall maintain a record\nwhich will readily disclose at any time, the aggregate number and outstanding\ntime balances of all premium finance agreements held by it, other than pursuant\nto a pledge. (e) Every licensee who\nis an insurance agent or broker and who holds a license pursuant to and\nrestricted by Banking Law, section 566(1), shall keep a separate record which\nwill readily disclose at all times the aggregate number and outstanding time\nbalances of premium finance agreements reacquired by the agent or broker from a\npremium finance agency under an agreement, entered into as an incident to the\nbona fide sale or pledge thereof to the premium finance agency, to reacquire it\nin case of default by the insured. (f) Every licensee shall maintain an\nindividual ledger card or appropriate combination of records with respect to\neach premium finance agreement showing: (1)\nthe name and address of the insured; (2)\nthe identifying account number; (3)\nthe name of the producer; (4)\nthe amount of the principal\nbalance; (5)\nthe date of\nacquisition; (6)\nthe name or names\nof the insurers and the policy numbers of the related insurance\ncontracts; (7)\nthe date from which\nthe service charge is payable and whether such date is the inception date of\nthe insurance contract or the due date of the premium financed or\nneither; (8)\nthe service\ncharge; (9)\nthe time\nbalance; (10)\nschedule of required\npayments. (g) The ledger\ncard shall also show all receipts setting forth their application to\noutstanding time balance, fines and other charges, if any, with the type of\nsuch charge clearly specified. (h) With respect to cancellation of insurance the licensee shall record the\neffective date of such cancellation, the date of notice to the insured and the\ndate of notice to the insurer. There shall also be recorded the amount of\nreturn premium, if any, received and the disposition thereof. (i) In connection with the prepayment of a\npremium finance agreement the ledger card shall show the amount of service\ncharge refund required to be made and the date such refund is made. (j) With respect to any premium finance\nagreement, whether charged off or not, upon which legal proceedings have been\ntaken, every licensee shall clearly indicate in permanent form on the insured's\nledger card or on a separate sheet or card or file bearing the identifying\naccount number, the following: (1)\nthe date\nof referral to an outside counsel for collection; (2)\nthe date and terms of any settlement\nagreed upon or the results of any legal or summary action taken for or against\nthe licensee; (3)\nthe nature of any\ncollection expense incurred by the licensee in connection with litigation and\ncharged to or paid by the insured or other obligor. Records bearing any notation made in conformity with this\nsubdivision shall be kept in a binder or file separate from other records, provided that the record as to premium finance agreement which has been paid in\nfull, or which is current as to payments, or concerning which a decision has\nbeen officially made to abandon collection efforts of every kind, may be placed\nelsewhere.
