  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 86-2.13 - Adjustments to provisional rates based on errors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Errors resulting from submission of fiscal and statistical information by a residential health care facility may be corrected if brought to the attention of the State Commissioner of Health within 120 days of receipt of the commissioner's initial rate computation sheet. Errors on the part of the State Department of Health resulting from the rate computation process may be corrected if brought to the attention of the commissioner within 120 days of receipt of the commissioner's initial rate computation sheet. Subsequent errors on the part of the State Department of Health resulting from the revision of a rate may be corrected if brought to the attention of the commissioner within 30 days of receipt of the commissioner's revised rate computation sheet. In no event, however, shall a facility have less than 120 days from receipt of the initial rate computation sheets to bring errors to the attention of the commissioner. (b) Rate appeals pursuant to this section, if not commenced within 120 days of receipt of the commissioner's initial rate computation sheet, may be initiated at time of audit of the base year cost figures at or prior to the audit exit conference. Such rate appeals shall be recognized only to the extent that they are based upon errors in the cost and/or statistical data submitted by the residential health care facility, or by revisions initiated by a third-party fiscal intermediary, or in the case of a governmental facility, by the sponsor government or errors made by the Department of Health.
