  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 661.13 - Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Companies shall apply interperiod tax\nallocation (tax normalization) to all book/tax timing differences which would\nbe considered material for published financial report purposes. Furthermore, companies shall also apply interperiod tax allocation if any item or group of\nsimilar items when aggregated would yield debit or credit entries which exceed\nor would exceed five percent of the gross deferred income tax expense debits or\ncredits during any calendar year over the life of the timing difference. Book/tax timing differences, other than those resulting from accelerated\ndepreciation or waiver, however, shall be phased in over a period of five years\nas directed by this commission. The tax effects of all book/tax timing\ndifferences shall be normalized and the deferrals shall be included in the\nfollowing accounts: 1360 Current Deferred Income Taxes--Dr\n1510 Noncurrent Deferred Income Taxes--Dr\n4100 Current Deferred Operating Income Taxes--Cr\n4110 Current Deferred Nonoperating Income\n\nTaxes--Cr\n4340 Noncurrent Deferred Operating Income\n\nTaxes--Cr\n4350 Noncurrent Deferred Nonoperating Income\n\nTaxes--Cr\n\nIn lieu of the accounting prescribed herein, any company\nshall treat the increase/reduction in current income taxes payable resulting\nfrom the use of flow through accounting in prior years and the phase-in years\nas an increase/reduction in current income tax expense. (b) Supporting documentation shall be\nmaintained so as to separately identify the amount of deferred taxes which\narise from the use of an accelerated method of depreciation. (c) With respect to the tax differentials\nthat are phased in, companies shall maintain underlying entries to and the\nbalances in the above accounts so as to show that the deferred tax amounts are\nnot greater than the phase-in percentage allowed by this commission. (d) The records supporting the activity in\nthe deferred income tax accounts shall be maintained in sufficient detail to\nidentify the nature of the specific timing differences giving rise to both the\ndebits and credits to the individual accounts. (e) Any company that uses accelerated\ndepreciation (or recognizes taxable income or losses upon the retirement of\nproperty) for income tax purposes shall normalize the tax differentials\noccasioned thereby as indicated in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nWith respect to the retirement of\nproperty the book/tax difference between (i) the recognition of proceeds as\nincome and the accrual for salvage value and (ii) the book and tax capital\nrecovery, shall be normalized. (2)\n\nRecords shall be maintained so as to show the deferred tax amounts by vintage\nyear separately for each class or subclass of eligible depreciable telephone\nplant for which an accelerated method of depreciation has been used for income\ntax purposes. When property is transferred to nonregulated activities, the\nassociated deferred income taxes shall also be identified and transferred to\nthe appropriate nonregulated accounts. Accumulated deferred investment tax\ncredits associated with deregulated assets shall be transferred with the\nrelated asset, unless otherwise directed by the commission. (f) The tax differentials to be\nnormalized as indicated herein shall also encompass the additional effect of\nstate and local income tax changes on Federal income taxes produced by the\nprovision for deferred state and local income taxes for book/tax timing\ndifferences related to such income taxes. (g) Companies that receive the tax benefits\nfrom the filing of a consolidated income tax return by the parent company, (pursuant to closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service, effective\n\nJanuary 1, 1966) representing the deferred income taxes from the elimination of\nintercompany profits for income tax purposes on sales of regulated equipment, may credit such deferred taxes directly to the plant account which contains\nsuch intercompany profit rather than crediting such deferred taxes to the\napplicable accounts in subdivision (a) of this section. If the deferred income\ntaxes are recorded as a reduction of the appropriate plant accounts, such\nreduction shall be treated as reducing the original cost of the plant and\naccounted for as such.
