  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 10075.4 - Sanitary facilities required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Connections. Sanitary facilities for all\nstructures in the City of Buffalo shall be provided in accordance with chapter\nXI of the Ordinances of the City of Buffalo: Buffalo Housing and Property Code, chapter XII of the Ordinances of the City of Buffalo: Buffalo Building Code and\nchapter XXV of the Ordinances of the City of Buffalo: Buffalo Health Ordinance\nand shall be connected with the facilities of the authority. (b) Building or house connections. Building\nservice sewers to residential, commercial or industrial buildings shall be\nrequired in accordance with applicable ordinances and with the Plumbing Code of\nthe City of Buffalo adopted by the Examining Board of Plumbers on February 4, 1957 and approved by the Erie County Health Department on April 2, 1957, as the\nsame may be amended from time to time, and all other sewer construction shall\nbe governed by such code and other ordinances of the city. (c) Private disposal system. Where a public\nsanitary or combined sewer is not available, a private sewage disposal system\nshall be required, and shall be installed in accordance with all laws of the\n\nState of New York, Code of the City of Buffalo and regulations of the State\n\nDepartment of Health. This installation shall be subject to the approval of the\n\nCommissioner of Health of the County of Erie, and shall be maintained and\noperated in a sanitary manner. (d) Existing connections. (1)\n\nExisting\nconnections to the combined sewer system will be allowed to function in their\npresent form until such time that separate sanitary and storm water sewers are\nconstructed to service such premises. At such time, all sanitary sewer outlets\nshall be required to be connected only to the sanitary sewers and stormwater\ndischarges to the MS4. (2)\n\nAmong\nothers, a purpose of this regulation is to deter, prevent and eliminate, as far\nas possible, the introduction of storm waters into the B.S.A. combined or trunk\nsewer system and all public sewers tributary thereto. However, it is recognized\nthat in certain areas the immediate and strict application and enforcement of\nthese regulations against existing and established connections would not be\nfeasible. (3)\n\nThis statement shall\nnot be construed to mitigate in any way the application and enforcement of\nthese regulations against the construction of any new combined sewers and\nagainst any new connections discharging storm water to the B.S.A. combined or\ntrunk sewer system and public sewers tributary thereto. Nor shall this\nstatement of policy be construed to be used as a defense against any changes\nwhich may be ordered by State or Federal regulatory agencies. (e) Other laws, rules and\nregulations. These regulations are in addition to the applicable charter and\ncode of the City of Buffalo, and the laws, rules and regulations of the State\nof New York and the United States. Where such laws, codes, rules and\nregulations contain provisions more restrictive than those contained in these\nregulations, the former shall apply. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n10075.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
