  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4608.3 - Standards for construction of bell jar tickets\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll bell jar tickets sold in the State of New York shall\ncomply with the following standards: (a) All bell jar tickets offered for sale or\nresale in New York shall have a commission-approved logo or manufacturer's name\nprinted thereon. (b) All bell jar\ntickets manufactured for sale or resale in New York after January 1, 1999 shall\ninclude a winner verification code on tickets redeemable for prizes with a\nvalue of $50 or more. Each manufacturer shall establish its own winner\nverification code for each bell jar ticket game or series of games. The winner\nverification code shall be a method of verifying winning bell jar tickets, after they have been purchased and opened, from nonwinning, altered or forged\nbell jar tickets. Manufacturers may use special numbers, colors, designs, ink\nor any combination thereof to establish the winner verification code. Manufacturers shall submit to the commission a letter explaining the winner\nverification code and shall keep the commission informed, by written notice, of\nany changes. Winner verification codes shall not be required for banded\nsingle-sided single-tabbed, doublesided single-tabbed and folded bell jar\ntickets. (c) Bell jar tickets shall\nbe constructed so that it is impossible to determine the covered or concealed\nnumber, color, symbol, set of symbols or game protection code on the bell jar\nticket by any method or device, including, without limitation, use of a\nmarking, variance in size, variance in paper color and fiber or examination by\n500-watt high-intensity light, until the bell jar ticket has been dispensed to\nand opened by the player. (d) All\nbell jar tickets, except banded bell jar tickets, shall be constructed using\npaper stock of at least two ply. (e) The manufacturer shall conspicuously\nprint on each bell jar ticket, excluding banded, single-sided single-tabbed and\ndouble-sided single-tabbed bell jar tickets, at least the following\ninformation: (1)\nthe game serial\nnumber; (2)\nthe name of the\nmanufacturer and/or the commission approved logo; (3)\nthe name of the game which must be\nidentical to the name of the game appearing on the flare for the\ndeal; (4)\nthe manufacturer's form\nnumber; (5)\nprice per individual\nbell jar ticket; and\n(6)\nthe number\nof winners in each tier and respective winning numbers or symbols and prize\namounts. On banded, single-sided single-tabbed and double-sided singletabbed\nbell jar tickets, the game serial number, the name of the manufacturer and/or\ncommission approved logo shall be printed so both are readily visible prior to\nopening the bell jar ticket. (f) No serial number used on a deal of bell\njar tickets may be repeated on that same manufacturer's form number within a\nthree-year period. Each tabbed bell jar ticket shall contain perforated and/or\nclean-cut openings over the numbers, colors or symbols on one side of each bell\njar ticket in such a manner as to allow easy opening by the consumer after\npurchase of the bell jar ticket, while not permitting bell jar tickets to be\nopened prematurely in normal handling. Perforation should exist on both the\nhorizontal lines of the opening with either perforate or clean-cut on the\nvertical or elliptical line where the ticket must be grasped for opening after\nbending the edge of the ticket. The numbers, colors or symbols must be fully\nvisible in the window and must be placed so that no part of the numbers, colors\nor symbols remain covered when a tab is removed. Placement of the numbers, colors or symbols to the left or right of center is allowed for increased game\nsecurity. On banded bell jar tickets, the paper stock of the band shall be\ncolor coded when individual serial numbers are repeated. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
