  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 218-5.2 - Remedial action plans for model-years 1993, 1994, 1996 and subsequent model-years\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Remedial\naction plans for facilities covered under California's reporting requirement'. If the state of California requires a remedial action plan based upon full\ncalendar or partial calendar quarter testing, under the California Code of\n\nRegulations, title 13, sections\n2065, 2109\nand\n2110\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), such plan\nwill apply to all vehicles certified to the California standards intended for\nsale in New York State. Such plan will not apply to vehicles that have\npreviously been sold to ultimate purchasers in New York. (b) Facilities not audited under California's\nreporting requirements. (1)\n\nNew vehicle\nassembly-line inspection testing. If reports required by an assembly-line test\nprocedure under section\n218-5.1\nof this Subpart are not in\naccordance with reporting requirements or if surveillance under section\n218-5.4\nof this Subpart indicates\nthat assembly-line inspection testing is being improperly performed, or that\nvehicles are being manufactured that do not comply with the assembly-line\nemission standards or functional test requirement at facilities that\nmanufacture cars certified to California standards, but do not ship cars to\n\nCalifornia, the department may require corrections of reporting or test\nprocedures in accordance with California Code of Regulations, title 13, section\n2106 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). (2)\n\nRemedial action plans for facilities not\naudited under California's reporting requirement. (i) Remedial action for assembly-line quality\naudit testing of a full or combined calendar quarter. (a) When required by the department, the\nmanufacturer must submit a remedial action plan to bring all new motor vehicles\nin possession of the manufacturer, distributors and dealers into compliance. The manufacturer must submit the plan within 30 calendar days after\nnotification. The department may require execution of the plan with such\nchanges and additions as necessary, including additional testing and reporting, consistent with the applicable assembly-line test procedures. The plan must\ninclude a schedule for implementing actions to be taken, including identified\nincrements of progress towards implementation, and deadlines for completing\neach such increment. (b) The\nmanufacturer may, within 15 calendar days of its receipt of the department's\ndemand for remedial action, request a public hearing, pursuant to Part 622 of\nthis Title, on the necessity for or scope of any corrective action required by\nthe department. (c) Failure by a\nmanufacturer to carry out all corrective actions required by the department\npursuant to the remedial action plan constitutes a violation of that plan and\nof section\n218-2.1\nof this Part. The\ndepartment may extend any deadline in the plan if it finds in writing that a\nmanufacturer has demonstrated that such a deadline will create an unreasonable\ntechnological burden upon the manufacturer. Each vehicle required by the plan\nissued by the department (including any modifications made by the department)\nto receive remedial action that does not receive such action by the deadline(s)\nincluded in the plan constitutes a separate violation of the plan. (d) Failure to comply with the remedial\naction plan or any part of such plan required pursuant to this Subpart may\nresult in penalties as permitted under article 71 of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law. (ii)\n\nRemedial action for assembly-line quality audit testing of less than a full\ncalendar quarter of production. (a) When\nrequired by the department, the manufacturer must submit a remedial action plan\nto bring all new motor vehicles in possession of the manufacturer into\ncompliance. The manufacturer must submit the plan within 30 calendar days after\nnotification. The department may require execution of the plan with such\nchanges and additions as necessary, including additional testing and reporting, consistent with the applicable assembly- line test procedures. The plan must\ninclude a schedule for implementing actions to be taken, including identified\nincrements of progress towards implementation, and deadlines for completing\neach such increment. (b) The\nmanufacturer may, within 15 calendar days of its receipt of the department's\ndemand for remedial action, request a public hearing, pursuant to Part 622 of\nthis Title on the necessity for or scope of any corrective action required by\nthe department. (c) Failure by a\nmanufacturer to carry out all corrective actions required by the department\npursuant to the remedial action plan constitutes a violation of that plan and\nof section\n218-2.1\nof this Part. The\ndepartment may extend any deadline in the plan if it finds in writing that a\nmanufacturer has demonstrated that such a deadline will create an unreasonable\ntechnological burden upon the manufacturer. Each vehicle required by the plan\nissued by the department (including any modifications made by the department)\nto receive remedial action that does not receive such action by the deadline(s)\nincluded in the plan constitutes a separate violation of the plan. (d) Failure to comply with the remedial\naction plan or any part of such plan required pursuant to this Subpart may\nresult in penalties as permitted under article 71 of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law.
