  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 77.1 - Refunds\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 171, 475 and 476\n(a) (1)\n\nWhenever any cigarettes upon which stamps evidencing the payment of the\ncigarette tax have been placed on packages thereof: (i) are sold and shipped into another state\nor other identified location outside of New York State for sale or use in such\nother state or location; or\n(ii)\nare destroyed; a dealer, including a licensed cigarette agent, shall be\nentitled to a refund of the actual amount of cigarette tax which was paid and\nborne by the dealer with respect to such cigarettes, provided an application\nfor refund is timely filed. Further, whenever any cigarettes upon which stamps\nhave been placed on packages thereof: (iii)\nbecome unfit for use and consumption; or\n(iv)\nbecome unsalable; a dealer who is a licensed agent shall, upon timely\napplication, be entitled to such a refund. Accordingly, a retail dealer and a\nwholesale dealer may be entitled to a refund of the face value of the stamps, including the city tax in the case of joint stamps. Where the dealer is a\nlicensed cigarette agent and has purchased and affixed said stamps, such agent\nmay be entitled to a refund of the face value of the stamps, less any\ncommissions allowed the agent pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law and the\n\nAdministrative Code of the City of New York. In the event that an agent cannot\nestablish the date of purchase of such stamps for purposes of ascertaining the\napplicable rate or rates of commission to be used in computing the net amount\nof refund due, the rate or rates in effect at the time of such sale, destruction or determination of unsuitability may be used, with the prior\nconsent of the Department of Taxation and Finance. (2)\n(i) Every dealer applying for a refund on the basis of cigarettes sold\nout-of-State, cigarettes destroyed or cigarettes determined to be unfit or\nunsalable must certify, in such application, that cigarette stamps were affixed\nto the packages of such cigarettes and that the dealer assumed the payment of\nthe tax. The dealer must also certify that such cigarettes, in fact, were sold\nout-of-State, destroyed or became unsuitable for use or sale and that no other\nclaim for refund has been, or will be, made with respect to such\ncigarettes. (ii)\nA dealer who sells\npackages of cigarettes upon which stamps have been placed to an out-of-State\npurchaser must obliterate or otherwise void such stamps prior to the time that\nthe cigarettes are shipped to the out-of-State location. Additionally, the\ndealer must require and receive from the out-of- State purchaser, at the time\nof each shipment and in support of any claim for refund, a certificate to the\neffect that the cigarettes (evidenced by a detailed invoice or other such\ndocument to be attached to the certificate) have been received by the purchaser\nwithout payment of the New York State cigarette tax, that the cigarettes will\nbe immediately removed from the State to an identified location for purposes of\nresale or use and that such cigarettes shall not be returned to the State for\nsale or use herein. The certificate must be signed by the purchaser and must be\nproperly completed as described in subdivision (d) of section\n76.1\nof this\n\nTitle. Where such cigarettes are sold by other than the stamping agent, the\ninvoice or other document to be attached to the subject certificate must, in\naddition to any other information, reflect the date that each container of\ncigarettes was received from the stamping agent. In lieu of furnishing the date\nfor each container, a dealer may elect to furnish the date that the oldest\ncontainer in the shipment was received from the stamping agent, with the\nunderstanding that such date may be used as an indication of the timeliness of\nany application for refund resulting from the out-of-State sale. A copy of the\ncertificate and the attachments must accompany any such claim for\nrefund. (iii)\nA dealer who makes an\napplication for a refund on the basis of cigarettes, in packages upon which\nstamps have been placed, which have been destroyed must preserve the packages\nof cigarettes, to the extent possible, in their original dated containers until\nsuch time as the department can inspect such packages or until notified\notherwise by the department. The provisions of this section with respect to\ncigarettes destroyed shall also apply with the same force and effect to\ncigarette stamps which have been affixed to packages of cigarettes and which\nstamps have been subsequently damaged so as to be considered\nworthless. (iv)\nA dealer who as a\nlicensed agent makes an application for a refund on the basis of cigarettes, in\npackages upon which stamps have been placed, which have not been destroyed but\nwhich have been determined to be unfit for use and consumption or unsalable\n(\ne.g., stale cigarettes) must establish to the satisfaction of\nthe department: (a) that, if applicable, the\nagent replaced such cigarettes or otherwise compensated any dealer who returned\nthe cigarettes to the agent to the extent that the payment of the cigarette tax\nwas again assumed by the agent; and\n(b) that the cigarettes were returned by the\nagent to the manufacturer or to the person who introduced such cigarettes into\nthe State and that such manufacturer or person did not reimburse the agent for\nthe payment of the tax. (b) (1)\n\nExcept if precluded in this Title, upon timely application, a person making\nsales of cigarettes in packages upon which stamps have been placed to an exempt\npurchaser described in Part 76 of this Title, or the exempt purchaser of such\ncigarettes, may, in extraordinary circumstances, be entitled to a refund of the\nactual amount of cigarette tax which was paid and borne by such seller or\npurchaser. The seller or exempt purchaser, as the case may be, must establish\nto the satisfaction of the Department of Taxation and Finance that the\ncigarette tax has been assumed by such seller or purchaser, that no other claim\nfor refund has been or will be made with respect to the subject cigarettes and\nthat no liability for the tax exists pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law. The\nseller or exempt purchaser must also establish, to the department's\nsatisfaction, the nature of the extraordinary circumstance which necessitated\nthe sale or purchase of cigarettes upon which the tax had been paid. For\nexample, the department may require a written explanation as to why such\nexemption could not have been effectuated in accordance with the provisions of\n\nPart 76 of this Title. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subdivision and pursuant to section\n76.5\nof this\n\nTitle, upon timely application, a person who acquires cigarettes in packages\nupon which stamps have been placed on behalf of the United Nations, or the\n\nUnited Nations as the purchaser of such cigarettes, will be entitled to a\nrefund of the actual amount of cigarette tax which was paid and borne by such\nperson or the United Nations. Provided however, such cigarettes must be\nacquired for the official use of the United Nations within its facilities and\nsuch cigarettes shall not be made available or sold to the general\npublic. (3)\n\nAny seller or exempt\npurchaser who makes an application for a refund pursuant to this subdivision\nmust obliterate or otherwise void the cigarette tax stamps on all packages of\ncigarettes which are the subjects of such claim. (c) Whenever the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance determines that any tax imposed by article 20 of the Tax Law has been\npaid in error, the dealer, including a licensed agent, shall be entitled to a\nrefund of the actual amount of tax paid, provided an application therefor is\ntimely filed. Such application, in addition to any other information as may be\nrequired, must disclose the exact nature of the erroneous payment of\ntax. (d) (1)\n\nUnless otherwise specifically provided in\nthis Title or elsewhere, an application for a refund must be filed with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance within two years after the cigarette stamps\nwere affixed to the packages of cigarettes which are the subjects of such\nclaim. For purposes of this section and unless otherwise established, cigarette\nstamps will be deemed affixed by a licensed cigarette agent immediately prior\nto the time that the cigarettes are sold by the agent, destroyed while in the\npossession of the agent or determined by the agent to be unfit or unsalable, whichever is earlier. Since persons other than agents are precluded from\npurchasing and affixing stamps, an application for refund must be filed by such\na person within two years after the date that the cigarettes were purchased\nfrom the stamping agent, as evidenced by purchase invoices or other such\ndocuments and by the dates that the cigarettes were received from the stamping\nagent, marked on the containers of such cigarettes pursuant to subdivision (c)\nof section\n74.3\nof this Title. (2)\n\nWhere, pursuant\nto section\n79.1\nof this\n\nTitle, a taxpayer has consented in writing to extend the period of time in\nwhich a determination of tax may be made and such agreement is made within the\ntwo-year periods specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the period of\ntime in which a taxpayer may file a claim for refund of cigarette tax paid will\nnot expire prior to six months after the expiration of the extended period\nwithin which a determination of tax may be made. (e) A refund will be allowed only to the\nextent that the claimant has paid and assumed the tax. If the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance is satisfied that any dealer or any other person is\nentitled to a refund, it may, subject to audit by the Comptroller, make a\nrefund of the cigarette tax paid. Where such dealer is a licensed cigarette\nagent, the department is authorized to issue to such agent cigarette stamps of\nsufficient value to cover the refund of the tax on cigarettes. No interest\nshall be paid by the department on any refund of the cigarette\ntax. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
