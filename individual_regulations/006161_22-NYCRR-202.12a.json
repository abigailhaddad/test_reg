Any P.O. Box or other\nalternate addresses associated with the defendant of which the servicer or its\nattorney is aware shall also be listed. If the mortgage servicer involved in\nthe case and listed on the RJI is changed at any time following the filing of\nthe RJI, plaintiff shall file with the court and serve on all the parties a\nnotice setting forth the name and contact information of the new or substituted\nmortgage servicer. (2)\n\nUpon the\nfiling of the RJI, the court shall send either a copy of the RJI, or the\ndefendant's name, address and telephone number (if available), to a housing\ncounseling agency or agencies funded by the New York State Office of the\n\nAttorney General's Homeowner Protection Program for the judicial district in\nwhich the defendant resides, for the purpose of that agency making the\nhomeowner aware of free foreclosure prevention services and options available\nto the parties. (3)\n\nIn such county\nor counties as the Chief Administrator shall direct, in the event that a\nplaintiff fails to file proof of service of the summons and complaint in a\nresidential mortgage foreclosure action with the county clerk within one\nhundred twenty days after the commencement of the action, or fails to file the\nRJI at the time of the filing of proof of service, the county clerk shall\nprovide the Chief Administrator with the case name, index number, property\naddress, and contact information of parties and counsel in the action.
