  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-4.3 - Tenants accounts receivable ledger\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis record has been given the short title, tenants\nledger. The procedures described herein are generally applicable to all types\nof operations. (a) Preparation of\nledger. The preparation of the tenants ledger sheets, the assigning of account\nnumbers, and the arrangement of the sheets by account numbers has been\ndescribed in section\n1642-3.13, to which reference\nshould be made. (b) New accounts. As described in section\n1642-3.13, a new tenants ledger\nsheet is prepared as a unit or space is leased. The authorization for a charge\nto a new tenant moving in shall be a move-in and collect notice (Exhibit 32, Appendix S-8) prepared and approved by the project manager. A charge to a\ntenant transferring from one unit to another shall, be supported by a move-out\nnotice (Exhibit 33, Appendix S-8) and move-in and collect notice, prepared and\napproved by the project manager. The pro rata rent specified in the move-in\nnotice shall be checked against the pro rata rent schedule to ascertain the\ncorrectness of the computation. Referring to the pro rata rent schedule, outlined in section\n1642-4.2, where the effective date\nof tenancy of a tenant moving into a dwelling unit with an authorized monthly\nrent of $19.95 was June 2, the pro rata rent charge to the tenant for the\nbalance of the month would be $19.29. (c) Posting monthly rent charges. As of the\nfirst day of the month, there shall be posted to each tenant's account, the\nauthorized monthly rent appearing in the heading of the tenants ledger sheet or\ncard. The authorized monthly rent consists of the basic rent and the rent\nsurcharge, if any. It will not be necessary to post the basic rent and the\nsurcharge separately. Simultaneously, all units vacant or vacated on the last\nday of the preceding month shall be listed, by account number, in the rent roll\nand vacancy loss control book (Exhibit 26, Appendix S-8), the full monthly\nbasic rent being entered in the vacancy loss debit column (column 18). The sum\nof the total charges to tenants accounts and to vacancy losses, as determined\nby an adding machine tape, shall agree with the total authorized dwelling rent\nroll, as of even date, as reflected in the rent roll and vacancy loss control\nbook. Interim rent charges shall be posted to the tenants ledger from move-in, and move-out notices, and rent change authorizations, signed by the project\nmanager. In order to post the rental charges before the first day of the month, it may be necessary to close the last day's business early. If this practice is\nfollowed, subsequent transactions that day shall be dated as of the first day\nof the following month. (d) Collections. (1)\n\nIn most instances, tenants\nwill be required to pay a full month's rent prior to occupancy. In the instance\ncited in subdivision (b) above, a tenant moving into a unit with an authorized\nmonthly rental of $19.95 would be charged to $19.29 for the remaining part of\nthe month if the effective date of occupancy was June 2. Prior to occupancy, the tenant would, however, pay the full month's rent of $19.95. As of June 30, the tenant's ledger sheet would show a credit balance, indicating prepaid rent, of $.66. On July 1, the tenant would be charged the full month's rent of\n$19.95, but would pay only the difference between the full month's rent and the\nprepaid balance, or $19.29. (2)\n\nReceipts shall be issued for all collections and shall be prepared in\nduplicate. A specimen form of receipt, for a hand posting system, is shown as\n\nExhibit 21 of Appendix S-8. One copy shall be given the tenant and the\nduplicate copy shall be kept at the project office for posting purposes. Receipts for hand posting shall be prenumbered. When a receipt is \"voided\", the\noriginal and duplicate shall be so marked and both copies stapled and retained. The receipt shall be signed by the person handling the transaction and may be\nfurther validated by an official stamp. Each person authorized to collect rents\nshould be assigned a set of receipts for his or her sole use. A control record\nshall be kept of all receipt forms purchased and issued. (3)\n\nAs an aid in proving the cash received\nagainst the receipts issued during the day and in making up the summary entry\nin the cash receipts register, it is recommended that a daily collection sheet\nbe utilized. A specimen form of daily collection sheet is shown as Exhibit 27\nof Appendix S-8. The essential minimum information which should be recorded on\na daily collection sheet (if used) upon the issuance of a receipt is the\nreceipt number, tenant's account number, name of tenant, and amount received. The specimen form of daily collection sheet exhibited provides additional\ncolumns to indicate the mode of payment, the analysis of the amounts received\nand to record such circumstances surrounding the payment as may be deemed\npertinent. The information provided by such additional columns is desirable but\nnot essential as it is already of record on the duplicate receipt. It should\nnot be insisted upon if its recording simultaneously with the minimum essential\ninformation proves to be too burdensome on the cashier and unduly holds up the\nline of tenants seeking to make payments. The daily collection sheet exhibited\ncan also be used to handle amounts received at the project office from others\nthan tenants, such as commissions on washing machine and coin telephone\ninstallations. If so used, all cash received at the project office can be more\nreadily accounted for and controlled. (4)\n\nAdequate provisions shall be made for the\nsafekeeping of collections while on the project premises or in transit to the\nbank. Collections, for example, should not be permitted to accumulate in the\ncash drawer, but should be placed in the project safe until the daily deposit\nis made up, etc. (e) Posting receipts. The medium for recording the individual amounts of cash\nreceipts in the appropriate individual tenant's accounts shall always be the\nproject's copy of the rental receipt. The receipt shall be initialed by the\nemployee after posting. Tenants' receipts shall be posted currently to the\ncredit side of the tenants' ledger accounts, and the date of entry shall be the\ndate the payment was received, as indicated on the receipt. After posting the\nreceipts, they shall be arranged in numerical sequence, including voided\nreceipts, and bound with an Acco or similar fastener, so that the receipts of\neach day are fastened together in a permanent file and are not mingled with the\nreceipts of other dates. However, if a bound book form of receipt is used, the\nduplicate receipt shall not be detached from the book. In small projects, the\nuse of a counter-register machine has been found to be advantageous. (f) Deposits. Deposits shall be made daily. Procedures in connection therewith, the various safeguards and precautions to\nbe taken, the use of night depositary facilities to avoid keeping collections\novernight in the project safe, the use of duplicate deposit tickets, etc., having been described in section\n1642-1.3. (g) Move-outs and rent refunds. As described\nin section\n1642-4.2, standard provisions in\nlease agreements require the tenant to give the local agency one full month's\nnotice of intent to vacate. The accounting section should be furnished with a\ncopy of the tenant's notice, which it should maintain in a tickler file against\nthe receipt of the move-out notice, prepared and approved by the project\nmanager, when the unit is vacated. The move-out notice establishes the\ncharge-through date. On the first of the month, all tenants are invariably\ncharged a full month's rent. No change in this procedure is made upon receipt\nof the copy of the tenant's notice of intent to vacate. When the move-out\nnotice establishing the charge-through date is received, however, the unearned\nrent, if any, is determined from the pro rata rent schedule and a miscellaneous\ncredit ticket for the unearned rent, supported by the move-out notice and the\ntenant's notice of intent to vacate, is prepared and posted to the tenant's\naccount. After the necessary rent adjustments have been made and it is\ndetermined that a refund is due on the tenant, the accounting section prepares\nand certifies a request for rent refund for the project manager's\ncertification. An account payable voucher, supported by the certified request\nfor rent refund, is then prepared and a check is drawn. All refunds shall be\nmade by check. No refunds shall be made out of cash receipts. The latter must\nbe deposited intact. When the refund is made, a miscellaneous charge ticket is\nprepared and posted to the tenant's account to close out the credit balance. If\na tenant moves prior to the expiration of the period for which he has paid\nrent, and the unit is subsequently rented, a refund should be made to the\nformer tenant for any portion of the period occupied by the new tenant. Under\nno circumstances shall rent be charged for the same period to two tenants for\nthe same space. (h) Surcharge\nadjustments. (1)\n\nRent surcharges refer to\nthat portion of the rent charged to tenants which is in excess of the basic\nrent for the dwelling unit. Rent surcharges are made in instances where\nfamilies are permitted, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Housing\n\nLaw, to continue in occupancy after their incomes exceed the statutory limit. Rent surcharges may be made, and, once made, may be adjusted upward or\ndownward, or eliminated entirely, as a result of a voluntary disclosure by the\ntenant or of a periodic income recheck. In no event, however, may a tenant be\ncharged less than the basic rent established for the dwelling unit. (2)\n\nSurcharge adjustments are ordinarily made\neffective with the date of the change in the family income and may therefore\nresult in retroactive surcharges. To avoid confusion in adjusting the rent roll\ncontrol totals, the last day of the month in which the rent change\nauthorization is approved by the project manager should be used as the cutoff\ndate for the period to which the retroactive surcharges shall apply. Retroactive surcharges may result in a charge or a credit to the\ntenant. (3)\nA change in a rent\nsurcharge and the retroactive surcharge, if any, not resulting from a move-in, move-out, or transfer, shall be authorized by a rent change authorization, prepared and approved by the project manager. After checking the rent change\nauthorization for arithmetical accuracy and conformity with local agency policy\nrelating surcharges to family income, the accounting section shall use the rent\ncharge authorization as the basis for charging or crediting the tenant's\naccount. An entry reflecting the surcharge adjustment and the retroactive\nsurcharge, if any, shall be simultaneously made in the rent roll and vacancy\nloss control book (see §\n1642-4.7\n). (i) Miscellaneous charge and credit tickets. Charges to all accounts, with the exception of monthly rent, and credits to all\naccounts with the exception of cash receipts shall be supported by\nmiscellaneous charge and credit tickets. Miscellaneous charge and credit\ntickets shall be numbered consecutively, contain complete explanatory\ninformation and be approved by the project manager. Miscellaneous charge and\ncredit tickets shall be posted daily to the tenants ledger. (j) Trial balance of tenants ledger. (1)\n\nThe taking of a trial balance of the\ntenants ledger at the close of each month, to agree with the control balance of\nthe tenants charges and credits book, has been described in section\n1642-3.13. It is recommended that\ntrial balances also be taken around the 15th and 25th of the month, so that\nerrors that may have occurred during the month may be localized. An extra copy\nshould be retained by the project account to be made available to the State\nauditor on his visits. (2)\n\nAt the\nend of each financial reporting period, the tenants accounts receivable\nbalances shall be analyzed and the debit balances separated from the credit\nbalances. The former shall be reported as Tenants Accounts Receivable (1122) on\nthe assets side of the balance sheet and the latter as Tenants Prepaid Rents\n(2240) on the liabilities side. The journal voucher entry to reflect the above, is a debit to account 1122 and a credit to account 2240. At the beginning of\nthe following reporting period, the above entry is reversed. (3)\n\nAs an aid to managements' collection\npolicy, the accounts receivable should be \"aged\" periodically. The separation\nof debit and credit balances and the aging of accounts receivable can be\nreadily accomplished from a trial balance of tenants accounts\nreceivable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
