  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 3000.11 - Stipulations for hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n(i) With the exception of those instances\nwhere the petitioner does not desire to stipulate any facts, the parties are\nrequired to stipulate, to the fullest extent to which complete or qualified\nagreement can or fairly should be reached, all facts not privileged which are\nrelevant to the pending controversy. Included in matters required to be\nstipulated are all facts, all documents and papers or contents or aspects\nthereof, and all evidence which fairly should not be in dispute. Where the\ntruth or authenticity of facts or evidence claimed to be relevant by one party\nis not disputed, an objection on the ground of materiality or relevance may be\nnoted by any other party but is not to be regarded as just cause for refusal to\nstipulate. The requirement of stipulation applies under this Part without\nregard to where the burden of proof may lie with respect to the controversies\ninvolved. Documents or papers or other exhibits annexed to or filed with the\nstipulation shall be considered to be part of the stipulation. (ii)\n\nAfter the petitioner initiates\nconferences with the office of counsel to facilitate agreement on the facts, the petitioner shall draw a proposed stipulation of facts and submit it to the\noffice of counsel. Failure to complete a stipulation is not a basis for\nadjournment of the hearing, and the parties shall endeavor to conclude the\ndrafting of the stipulation in advance of the scheduled hearing. The office of\ncounsel shall review the proposed stipulation drawn by the petitioner and shall\nindicate its agreement or disagreement with every proposed fact to be\nstipulated. Where the office of counsel disagrees, its position as to the fact\nin question should be stated. (2)\n\nThe fact that any matter may have been\nobtained through any other authorized procedure is not a ground for omitting\nsuch matter from the stipulation. Such other procedures should be regarded as\naids to stipulation, and matter obtained through them, which is within the\nscope of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, must be set forth comprehensively\nin the stipulation, in logical order in the context of all other provisions of\nthe stipulation. (b) Form. Stipulations shall be in writing, signed by the parties thereto or by\ntheir representative, and shall be filed with the supervising administrative\nlaw judge in duplicate. Only one set of exhibits shall be required. Documents\nor other papers, which are the subject of stipulation in any respect and which\nthe parties intend to place before the Division of Tax Appeals, shall be\nannexed to or filed with the stipulation. The stipulation shall be clear and\nconcise. Separate items shall be stated in separate paragraphs, and shall be\nappropriately numbered. Exhibits attached to a stipulation shall be lettered\nserially. (c) Filing. Executed\nstipulations prepared pursuant to this subdivision, and related exhibits, shall\nbe filed by the parties with the supervising administrative law judge, at or\nbefore commencement of the hearing of the controversy, unless the supervising\nadministrative law judge shall otherwise specify. A stipulation, when filed, need not be offered formally to be considered in evidence. (d) Objections. Any objection to all or any\npart of a stipulation should be noted in the stipulation, but the\nadministrative law judge or presiding officer will consider any objection to a\nstipulated matter made at the commencement of the hearing or for good cause\nshown, made during the hearing. (e) Binding effect. A stipulation shall be treated, to the extent of its terms, as\na conclusive admission by the parties to the stipulation, unless otherwise\npermitted by the tribunal, administrative law judge or presiding officer, or\nagreed upon by the parties. The tribunal, administrative law judge or presiding\nofficer will not permit a party to a stipulation to qualify, change or\ncontradict a stipulation in whole or in part, except where justice requires. A\nstipulation and the admissions therein shall be binding and have effect only in\nthe pending proceeding and not for any other purpose, and cannot be used\nagainst any of the parties thereto in any other proceeding. (f) Noncompliance by a party. (1)\n\nMotion to compel stipulation. If, at the\ndate of issuance of a hearing notice in a controversy, a party has refused or\nfailed to confer with his or her adversary with respect to entering into a\nstipulation in accordance with this section, or has refused or failed to make a\nstipulation of any matter within the terms of this section, the party proposing\nto stipulate may, within 90 days of service of the proposed stipulation, make a\nmotion to the tribunal, on notice to the other party or representative, if any, for an order directing that the matters covered in the motion should be deemed\nadmitted for the purposes of the hearing. The motion shall be filed with the\nsupervising administrative law judge and shall: (i) show with particularity and by separately\nnumbered paragraphs each matter which is claimed for stipulation; (ii)\nset forth the specific stipulation which\nthe moving party proposes with respect to each such matter, together with a\ncopy of each document or other paper as to which the moving party desires a\nstipulation; (iii)\nset forth the\nsources, reasons, and bases for claiming, with respect to each such matter, why\nit should be stipulated to; (iv)\nshow that the other party has been informed of and has had reasonable access to\nthe sources or bases for the stipulation, and the reasons for stipulation; and\n(v) show proof of service of a\ncopy of the motion papers on the other party or the party's representative, if\nany. (2)\n\nProcedure. Within 20 days of the service of the notice of the motion, that party shall\nfile a response with the supervising administrative law judge, with proof of\nservice of a copy thereof on the other party or representative, if any, showing\nwhy the matter set forth in the motion papers should not be deemed admitted for\npurposes of the pending controversy. The response shall list each matter\ninvolved on which there is no dispute, referring specifically to the numbered\nparagraphs in the motion to which the admissions relate. Where a matter is\ndisputed only in part, the response shall show the part admitted and the part\ndisputed. Where the responding party is willing to stipulate in whole or in\npart with respect to any matter in the motion by varying or qualifying a matter\nin the proposed stipulation, the response shall set forth the variance or\nqualification and the admission which the responding party is willing to make. Where the response claims that there is a dispute as to any matter in part or\nin whole, or where the response presents a variance or qualification with\nrespect to any matter in the motion, the response shall show the sources, reasons and bases on which the responding party relies for that purpose. The\nsupervising administrative law judge, where it is found appropriate, may\nschedule the motion for a hearing before an administrative law judge at such\ntime as the supervising administrative law judge shall determine. (3)\n\nFailure to respond. If no response is\nfiled within the period specified with respect to any matter or portion\nthereof, or if the response is evasive or not fairly directed to the proposed\nstipulation or portion thereof, that matter or portion thereof will be deemed\nstipulated for purposes of the pending controversy, and an order will be\nentered accordingly. (4)\n\nMatters\nconsidered. Opposing claims of evidence will not be weighed unless such\nevidence is patently incredible. Nor will a genuinely controverted or doubtful\nissue of fact be determined in advance of the hearing. The supervising\nadministrative law judge will determine whether a genuine dispute exists, or\nwhether in the interests of justice a matter ought not be deemed\nstipulated. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
