  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 155.23 - Multi-year cost allowance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfollowing methodology establishes a multi-year cost allowance which shall apply\nto school districts and boards of cooperative educational services for the\npurpose of computation of building aid: (1)\n\nEvery school district and board of cooperative educational services shall\nsubmit a building condition survey report as required by section\n155.4\nof this Part. (2)\n\nCost allowances for reconstructing or\nmodernizing structures shall not exceed 100 percent of the cost allowances for\nthe equivalent new construction over the projected useful life of the building. Building aid cost allowances shall not exceed the maximum cost allowance for\nthe projected useful life of a new building, addition or reconstruction and\nalterations, using a declining balance method. Once the maximum cost allowance\nhas been exhausted, no further building aid shall be calculated until the\nprojected useful life span has been exhausted. (3)\n\nThe architect or engineer of record shall\ncertify to the commissioner the probable useful life of any capital\nconstruction work submitted to the commissioner. (4)\n\nThe architect or engineer of record shall\nprovide documentation to the commissioner regarding the proper operation and\nmaintenance for each system. (5)\n\nThe probable useful life of any building system shall be the period described\nin section\n11.00\nof\nthe Local Finance Law. In the absence of any reference to section\n11.00\nof\nthe Local Finance Law regarding periods of probable useful life, the following\nshall apply: 30 years for new buildings; 20 years for additions; 15 years for\nreconstruction projects. (6)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may reduce the probable useful life expectancy for purposes of the\ncalculation of building aid upon a finding that replacement or renovation of\nthe existing building is necessary to protect the health and safety of students\nor staff, and that the need to replace or renovate the building was not caused\nby a failure to properly operate and maintain the building. (b) Appeals to the commissioner. A\nschool district or a board of cooperative educational services may appeal a\ndetermination of the commissioner that a building has not been adequately\nmaintained. To appeal, a school district or a board of cooperative educational\nservices shall submit documentation describing: how the building was\nmaintained; why the building and/or any of its major building systems, as\ndefined in Education Law section 3602(6)(4), did not last as long as\nanticipated; what steps, if any, are being taken to remedy the failure of the\nbuilding and/or any of its major building systems to last for the entire period\nof probable usefulness; and any other relevant information requested by the\ncommissioner. In addition, the district or board of cooperative educational\nservices shall submit information regarding any claims for recoveries, including insurance guarantee and warranty claims, and the status of any such\nclaims.
