  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.8 - Full disclosure\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1170 ]\nThe concept of full disclosure\nrequires that all significant data be clearly and completely reflected in\naccounting reports. If, for example, a hospital were to change its method of\naccounting for certain transactions, within the limitations of this manual, and\nif the change had a material effect on the reported financial position or\noperating results, the nature of the change in method and its effect must be\ndisclosed when reporting costs to any agency. No fact that would influence the\ndecisions of management, the governing board, or other users of financial\nstatements should be omitted from or concealed in accounting reports. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
