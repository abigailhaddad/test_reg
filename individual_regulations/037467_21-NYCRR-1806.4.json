  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1806.4 - Projects requiring review and approval\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except for activities relating to site\nevaluation or those authorized under section\n1806.34\nof this Part, no person\nshall undertake any of the following projects without prior review and approval\nby the commission. The project sponsor shall submit an application in\naccordance with sections\n1806.10\n-1806.16 of this Part and\nshall be subject to the applicable standards in sections\n1806.20\n-1806.25 of this Part. (1)\n\nConsumptive use of water. Any consumptive\nuse project described below shall require an application to be submitted in\naccordance with section\n1806.13\nof this Part, and shall be\nsubject to the standards set forth in section\n1806.22\nof this Part, and, to the\nextent that it involves a withdrawal from groundwater or surface water, shall\nalso be subject to the standards set forth in section\n1806.23\nof this Part. Except to\nthe extent that they involve the diversion of the waters of the basin, public\nwater supplies shall be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding\nconsumptive use; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued to exempt individual consumptive users connected to any such public\nwater supply from the requirements of this section. Provided the commission\ndetermines that low flow augmentation projects sponsored by the commission's\nmember states provide sufficient mitigation for agricultural water use to meet\nthe standards set forth in section\n1806.22\nof this Part, and except\nas otherwise provided below, agricultural water use projects shall not be\nsubject to the requirements of this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an agricultural water use project involving a diversion of the waters of the\nbasin shall be subject to such requirements unless the property, or contiguous\nparcels of property, upon which the agricultural water use project occurs is\nlocated at least partially within the basin. (i) Any project initiated on or after January\n23, 1971, involving a consumptive water use of an average of 20,000 gallons per\nday (gpd) or more in any consecutive 30-day period. (ii)\n\nWith respect to projects previously\napproved by the commission for consumptive use, any project that will involve\nan increase in a consumptive use above that amount which was previously\napproved. (iii)\n\nWith respect to\nprojects that existed prior to January 23, 1971, any project that increases its\nconsumptive use by an average of 20,000 gpd or more in any consecutive 30-day\nperiod above its pre-compact consumptive use. (iv)\n\nAny project, regardless of when\ninitiated, involving a consumptive use of an average of 20,000 gpd or more in\nany 30-day period, and undergoing a change of ownership, unless such project\nsatisfies the requirements of subdivision (b) or (c) of this section or the\nexisting commission approval for such project is transferred pursuant to\nsection\n1806.6\nof this Part. (2)\n\nWithdrawals. Any project\ndescribed below shall require an application to be submitted in accordance with\nsection\n1806.13\nof this Part, and shall be\nsubject to the standards set forth in section\n1806.23\nof this Part. Hydroelectric projects, except to the extent that such projects involve a\nwithdrawal, shall be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding\nwithdrawals; provided, however, that nothing in this subdivision shall be\nconstrued as exempting hydroelectric projects from review and approval under\nany other category of project requiring review and approval as set forth in\nthis section, section\n1806.5\nof this Part, or 18 CFR\npart\n801. The taking or removal of water by a public water supplier indirectly\nthrough another public water supply system or another water user's facilities\nshall constitute a withdrawal hereunder. (i) Any project initiated on or after the applicable dates specified in\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, withdrawing a consecutive 30-day average\nof 100,000 gpd or more from a groundwater or surface water source, or a\ncombination of such sources. (ii)\n\nWith respect to projects previously approved by the commission, any project\nthat increases a withdrawal above that amount which was previously approved and\nany project that will add a source or increase withdrawals from an existing\nsource which did not require approval prior to January 1, 2007. (iii)\n\nAny project which involves a withdrawal\nfrom a groundwater or surface water source and which is subject to the\nrequirements of this subdivision regarding consumptive use. (iv)\n\nWith respect to groundwater projects in\nexistence prior to July 13, 1978, and surface water projects in existence prior\nto November 11, 1995, any project that will increase its withdrawal from any\nsource, or initiate a withdrawal from a new source, or combination of sources, by a consecutive 30-day average of 100,000 gpd or more, above that maximum\nconsecutive 30-day amount which the project was withdrawing prior to the said\napplicable date. (v) Any project, regardless of when initiated, involving a withdrawal of a consecutive 30-day\naverage of 100,000 gpd or more, from either groundwater or surface water\nsources, or in combination from both, and undergoing a change of ownership, unless such project satisfies the requirements of subdivision (b) or (c) of\nthis section or the existing commission approval for such project is\ntransferred pursuant to section\n1806.6\nof this Part. (3)\n\nDiversions. Except with\nrespect to agricultural water use projects not subject to the requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the projects described in subparagraphs\n(i)-(iv) of this paragraph shall require an application to be submitted in\naccordance with section\n1806.13\nof this Part, and shall be\nsubject to the standards set forth in section\n1806.24\nof this Part. The project\nsponsors of out-of-basin diversions shall also comply with all applicable\nrequirements of this Part relating to consumptive uses and withdrawals. The\nprojects identified in subparagraphs (v) and (vi) of this paragraph shall be\nsubject to regulation pursuant to section\n1806.22\n(f) of\nthis Part. (i) Any project initiated on or\nafter January 23, 1971, involving the diversion of water into the basin, or\ninvolving a diversion of water out of the basin of an average of 20,000 gallons\nof water per day or more in any consecutive 30-day period. (ii)\n\nWith respect to diversions previously\napproved by the commission, any project that will increase a diversion above\nthe amount previously approved. (iii)\n\nWith respect to diversions initiated\nprior to January 23, 1971, any project that will increase a diversion into the\nbasin by any amount, or increase the diversion of water out of the basin by an\naverage of 20,000 gpd or more in any consecutive 30-day period. (iv)\n\nAny project, regardless of when\ninitiated, involving the diversion of water into the basin or involving a\ndiversion of an average of 20,000 gallons of water per day or more in any\nconsecutive 30-day period out of the basin, and undergoing a change of\nownership, unless such project satisfies the requirements of subdivision (b) or\n(c) of this section or the commission approval for such project is transferred\npursuant to section\n1806.6\nof this Part. (v) The interbasin diversion of any flowback\nor production fluids from hydrocarbon development projects from one drilling\npad site to another drilling pad site for use in hydrofracture stimulation, provided it is handled, transported and stored in compliance with all standards\nand requirements of the applicable member jurisdiction, shall not be subject to\nseparate review and approval as a diversion under this paragraph if the\ngenerating or receiving pad site is subject to an approval by rule issued\npursuant to section\n1806.22\n(f) of\nthis Part and provided all monitoring and reporting requirements applicable to\nsuch approval are met.
