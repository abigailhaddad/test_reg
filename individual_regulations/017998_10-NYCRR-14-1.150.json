  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 14-1.150 - Garbage and refuse storage and disposal\n\nState Regulations\n\nGarbage and refuse are to be stored, handled and disposed of in a manner that protects food and food-contact surfaces from contamination and the premises from litter. (a) Garbage and refuse is to be kept in durable, easily cleanable, insect-proof and rodent-proof containers. Plastic and wet-strength paper bags may be used to line garbage and refuse containers and for storage inside the food service establishment. (b) Garbage and refuse containers in food preparation and utensil washing areas are to be covered when not in use, and after they are filled. (c) Garbage and refuse containers stored outside the establishment, and dumpster, compactors and compactor systems, are to be easily cleanable, provided with tight-fitting lids, doors or covers, and kept covered when not in actual use. In containers designed with drains, drain plugs are to be in place at all times except during cleaning. (d) A sufficient number of containers are to be provided to hold all the garbage and refuse that accumulates between periods of pickup and removal. Containers are to be cleaned at a frequency to prevent insect and rodent attraction. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
