  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 921-6.2 - Faltering company\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This exception applies only to plant closings as defined under the Act. An\nemployer qualifies for a reduced notice under this exception if at the time\nnotice would have been required: (1)\n\nThe\nemployer was actively seeking capital or business and identifies the specific\nactions taken to obtain such capital or business. For example, the employer\nmust demonstrate its efforts to obtain financing or refinancing through the\narrangement of loans, the issuance of stocks, bonds, or other methods, or to\nobtain additional money, credit, or business through any other commercially\nreasonable method; and\n(2)\n\nThere\nwas a realistic opportunity to obtain the capital or business sought; and\n(3)\n\nThe capital or business\nsought would have been sufficient, if obtained, to enable the employer to avoid\nor postpone the plant closing; and\n(4)\n\nThe employer reasonably and in good faith\nbelieved that giving notice would have precluded the ability to obtain the\nneeded capital or business. The employer must be able to objectively\ndemonstrate that a potential customer or financing source would have been\nunwilling to provide the new business or capital if notice were given. This\ncondition may be satisfied if the employer can show that the financing or\nbusiness source would not choose to do business with a troubled company or with\na company whose workforce would be looking for other jobs. (b) For the purposes of this Part, the\nemployer's actions will be viewed in a company-wide context. A company with\naccess to capital markets or with cash reserves may not avail itself of this\nexception by looking solely at the financial condition of the single site of\nemployment to be closed and doing so shall constitute a violation of the Act\nand this Part.
