No product shall be wholly or partly enclosed in any wrapper, packaging or other container that is so wholly or partly enclosed in any\nwrapper, packaging or other container that is so made, formed or filled as to\nbe misleading. (b) The labels and\ncontainers of product shall comply with the following provisions, as\napplicable: (1)\n\nTerms having geographical\nsignificance with reference to a lacality other than that in which the product\nis prepared may appear on the label only when qualified by the word \"style\", \"type\" or \"brand\", as the case may be, in the same size and style of lettering\nas in the geographical term, and accompanied with a prominent qualifying\nstatement identifying the country, State, territory or locality in which the\nproduct is prepared, using terms appropriate to effect the qualification. When\nthe word \"style\" or \"type\" is used, there must be a recognized style or type of\nproduct identified with and peculiar to the area represented by the\ngeographical term and the product must possess the characteristics of such\nstyle or type and the word \"brand\" shall not be used in such a way as to be\nfalse or misleading; provided, that a geographical term which has come into\ngeneral usage as a trade name and which has been approved by the commissioner\nas being a generic term may be used without the qualifications provided for in\nthis paragraph. The terms \"frankfurter\", \"vienna\", \"bologna\", \"lebanon\nbologna\", \"braunschweiger\", \"thuringer\", \"genoa\", \"leona\", \"berliner\", \"holstein\", \"goteborg\", \"milan\", \"polish\", \"italian\" and their modifications, as applied to sausages, the terms \"brunswick\" and \"irish\" as applied to stews\nand the term \"boston\" as applied to pork shoulder butts need not be accompanied\nwith the word \"style\", \"type\" or \"brand\" or a statement identifying the\nlocality in which the product is prepared.
