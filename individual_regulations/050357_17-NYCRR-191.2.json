  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 191.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following words and phrases used in this Part are\ndefined as follows: (a) Curb. A vertical or sloping member along the edge of a roadway\nclearly defining the pavement edge. (b) Highway. The entire width between the boundary lines of every way\npublicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for\npurposes of vehicular travel. For the purposes of this Part, the word\nhighway\nis a generic term for parkway, road, street, avenue, drive, boulevard, lane, etc. (c) Intersection. The area embraced when two or more highways join one\nanother. Where a highway includes two roadways 30 feet or more apart, then\nevery crossing of each roadway of such divided highway by an intersecting\nhighway shall be regarded as a separate intersection. In the event such\nintersecting highway also includes two roadways 30 feet or more apart, then\nevery crossing of two roadways of such highways shall be regarded as a separate\nintersection. There is no differentiation between intersections involving\nmajor highways and intersections involving minor highways. Each intersection is\nevaluated on its own merits by calculating the hazard points from the\nappropriate chart in section\n191.4\nof this Part. (d) Narrow bridge or\nunderpass. A bridge or underpass which, because of significant\nreduction in pavement widths on or under the structure, requires students to\nwalk on the roadway due to the absence of shoulders or sidewalks. In addition, for a location to be considered as a narrow bridge or underpass, at least one\nof the following roadway widths shall exist: (1)\ntwo way traffic with a width of less than\n18 feet; (2)\ntwo way traffic with a\nwidth greater than or equal to 18 feet, but less than the width of the approach\nroadway; (3)\none way bridge with a\nwidth of less than or equal to 10 feet; or\n(4)\none way bridge with a roadway width less\nthan the width of the approach roadway. (e) No control. Neither stop signs nor traffic signals are in place that\nwould require vehicles to stop on the roadway which the children are crossing. Yield signs are not considered as stop controls for the purpose of these\nguidelines. (f) Number of lanes crossed. The total number of lanes on the roadway being crossed, including through lanes and turning lanes. (g) Number of tracks. The number of railroad tracks at a railroad crossing. Tracks must be within 100 feet of each other to be considered as part of the\nsame crossing. Crossings with an adult school crossing guard is considered in\nthe same vain as crossing a street with an adult crossing guard. Therefore, no\nhazard is deemed to exist. (h) Number of trains. The sum of all freight and passenger trains using a\nrailroad crossing during a one hour interval in the morning and a one hour\ninterval in the afternoon. The one hour intervals should occur during the\nnormal hours students can be expected to walk to and from school. The number of\npassenger trains using the crossing during the affected hours can usually be\nobtained from the railroad companies. However, determining the number of\nfreight trains may require a manual count because their schedule is subject to\na degree of randomness. Since the number of freight trains using a crossing may\nvary from day to day, an average count based on five weekdays of observations\nduring the morning and afternoon crossing periods must be made. Switching\nmovements using a crossing can also be considered, but the number used should\nbe an average count based on five weekdays of observations during the morning\nand afternoon crossing periods. (i) Pedestrian devices. The presence of traffic control equipment such as\npedestrian signal indications and/or pedestrian push buttons for the purpose of\ncontrolling pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian indications are traffic signal\nindications which consist of the illuminated words \"WALK\" and \"DONT WALK\". A\ntraffic signal equipped with pedestrian indications may or may not have push\nbuttons to operate the pedestrian signal. The other type of pedestrian device\nis simply a pedestrian push button attached to a pole or post. When used\nwithout pedestrian signal indications, the activated push button provides for\nadditional time so that a pedestrian can cross the street safely. It should be\nnoted that all traffic will not necessarily come to a halt when the indications\nare displayed. While some traffic signals are equipped with pedestrian\nindications that provide an exclusive walk phase and no turns on red, others\nhave pedestrian indications which allow traffic and pedestrians to move\nconcurrently. Therefore, it is important to recognize the type of pedestrian\nindications because they do not all operate in the same manner. (j) Roadway. The portion of a highway improved, designed, marked, or\nordinarily used for vehicular travel, exclusive of the shoulder and slope. In\nthe event a highway includes two or more separate roadways\n(\ni.e., divided highway), the term\nroadway\nshall refer to any such roadway separately. The median is not considered a part\nof the roadway. (k) Shoulder. The portion of a highway contiguous with the roadway. Generally, this is the relatively flat area between the outer edge of a roadway\nwith no curb and the point where the earth begins sloping either upward or\ndownward, intended for the use by stopped vehicles and for emergency use. It\nmay be paved or unpaved. A shoulder with a width less than five feet is\nconsidered a narrow shoulder. For the purposes of this program, a shoulder will be\nconsidered to exist if it is visible by means of pavement marking delineation\n(\ni.e., a white edgeline) or if the pavement seams or joints\nmakes it appear that a shoulder (usually less than the width of a travel lane)\nis present. (l) Sidewalk. The portion of a street between the curb lines, or the\nlateral lines of a roadway, and the adjacent property lines, intended for the\nuse of pedestrians. It may be paved or unpaved. (m) Speed limit. The legally set maximum speed which vehicles are permitted\nto travel on a roadway. (n) Stop sign control. Traffic on the roadway being crossed by the school children\nis required to stop by a stop sign. (o) Traffic control signals. Any device, whether manually, electrically, or mechanically\noperated, by which traffic is alternately directed to stop and permitted to\nproceed. (p) Volume\nof traffic. The volume of traffic on a highway is based on a 15 minute\nvehicular traffic count including all through and turning vehicles, during a\ntypical morning or afternoon period in which students are walking to or from\nschool. The hourly volume, if known, may be substituted for the 15 minute count\nby simply dividing the hourly count by four. If traffic counts are conducted\nfor both the morning and afternoon period, then the average of the two volume\ncounts should be used. However, there is no requirement to conduct more than\none traffic count for each highway under consideration. The volume of traffic can be classified into the following\ncategories for the purpose of this program: Low (L)\n< 50 vehicles per 15 minute period\n\nMedium (M)\n50 to 100 vehicles per 15 minute\nperiod\n\nHigh (H)\n> 100 vehicles per 15 minute\nperiod\nA separate count should be made whenever a change in the\nspeed limit occurs or the type of walking facility changes, (\ni.e., sidewalk to shoulder to no shoulder). In addition, a\nnew traffic count should be made when it is suspected that the volume changes\ndue to the influence of an intersecting highway. It is possible that a stretch\nof highway may have several segments each with different or similar volume\ngroups. (q) A vacant\nbuilding or structure is a building or structure that a county, city, town, village, borough, or other municipal entity has determined to be unoccupied for\nsuch a period of time as determined by the county, city town, village, borough, or other municipal entity to be categorized as vacant. (r) A violent crime is a category of offenses\ndefined in the New York Penal Law that are indexed by the Division of Criminal\n\nJustice Services, including but not limited to murder, rape, robbery and\naggravated assault.
