The commission may issue a general permit, in lieu of\nissuing individual approvals, for a specifically described category of\ndiversions, water withdrawals and consumptive uses that: (1)\ninvolve the same or substantially similar\ntypes of operations or activities; (2)\nrequire the same limitations or operating\nconditions, or both; (3)\nrequire\nthe same or similar monitoring and reporting; and\n(4)\nwill result in minimal adverse impacts\nconsistent with sections\n1806.21\nthrough\n1806.24\nof this Part. (b) Procedure for\nissuance. (1)\n\nAt least 30 days prior to\nthe issuance of a general permit, the commission shall publish notice in the\n\nFederal Register\nand the member jurisdiction administrative\nbulletins of the intent to issue a general permit. (2)\n\nAt least 30 days shall be provided for\ninterested members of the public and Federal, State and local agencies to\nprovide written comments on a proposed general permit. (3)\n\nThe commission or executive director may, in its discretion, hold a public hearing on a proposed general permit, taking\ninto account the level of public interest and likelihood of\ncontroversy. (4)\n\nThe issuance of a\ngeneral permit adopted by the commission will be published in the\n\nFederal Register\nand the member jurisdiction administrative\nbulletins. This notice shall set forth the effective date of the general\npermit. (c) Administration of general permits. General permits may be issued, amended, suspended, revoked, reissued or terminated under this section. (1)\n\nAny general permit issued under this\nsection shall set forth the applicability of the permit and the conditions that\napply to any diversion, withdrawal or consumptive use authorized by such\ngeneral permit. (2)\n\nThe commission\nmay fix a term to any general permit issued. (3)\nA project sponsor shall obtain permission\nto divert, withdraw or consumptively use water in accordance with a general\npermit by filing a Notice of Intent (NOI) with the commission, in a form and\nmanner determined by the commission. (4)\n\nApproval of coverage under a general\npermit shall be determined by the executive director or by any other manner\nthat the commission shall establish for any general permit. (5)\n\nThe commission may set a fee for NOIs to\nany general permit. (6)\nA project\nsponsor shall provide notice for NOIs in accordance with section\n1806.15\n(h) of\nthis Part and any additional notice requirements that the commission may adopt\nfor any general permit. (7)\n\nThe\nrequirements of section\n1806.16\nof this Part apply to the\nreview of NOIs to any general permit. (8)\n\nUpon reissuance or amendment of a general\npermit, all project sponsors permitted to divert, withdraw or consumptively use\nwater in accordance with the previous general permit shall be permitted to\ncontinue to operate with the renewed or modified general permit unless\notherwise notified by the commission. (9)\n\nNotice of receipt of NOIs shall be\npublished on the commission's website and in any other manner that the\ncommission shall establish for any general permit. (d) Denial of coverage. The executive director will deny or revoke coverage under a\ngeneral permit when one or more of the following conditions exist: (1)\n\nThe project or project sponsor does not\nor can no longer meet the criteria for coverage under a general\npermit. (2)\n\nThe diversion, withdrawal or consumptive use, individually or in combination with other\nsimilar commission regulated activities, is causing or has the potential to\ncause adverse impacts to water resources or competing water users. (3)\n\nThe project does not comport with section\n1806.21\n(a) or (b)\nof this Part. (4)\n\nThe project\nincludes other diversions, withdrawals or consumptive uses that require an\nindividual approval and the issuance of both an individual approval and a\ngeneral permit for the project would constitute an undue administrative burden\non the commission. (5)\n\nThe\nexecutive director determines that a project cannot be effectively regulated\nunder a general permit and is more effectively regulated under an individual\napproval. (e) Requiring an individual approval. If coverage is denied or revoked under subdivision (d) of\nthis section, the project sponsor shall be notified in writing. The notice will\ninclude a brief statement for the reasons for the decision. If coverage under a\ngeneral permit was previously granted, the notice will also include a deadline\nfor submission of an application for an individual approval. Timely submission\nof a complete application will result in continuation of coverage of the\napplicable withdrawal, consumptive use or diversion under the general permit, until the commission takes final action on the pending individual approval\napplication. (f) Action\nof the commission. Action by the executive director denying or revoking\ncoverage under a general permit under subdivision (d) of this section, or\nrequiring an individual approval under subdivision (e) of this section, is not\na final action of the commission until the project sponsor submits and the\ncommission takes final action on an individual approval application.
