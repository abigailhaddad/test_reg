INSERT the following paragraphs: Support: 03A The normal rules of the road and traffic control\npriority identified in the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law govern the\norder assigned to the movement of vehicles at an intersection unless the New\n\nYork State Department of Transportation determines that it is appropriate to\nassign a higher priority to LRT.

Standard: 07A Before any new highway-LRT grade crossing traffic\ncontrol system is installed or modifications are made to an existing system, approval shall be obtained from the New York State Department of\n\nTransportation. Support: 11A Section 1685 of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic\n\nLaw allows the installation of a STOP (R1-1) sign only with prior authorization\nfrom the New York State Department of Transportation at any highway-LRT grade\ncrossing.
