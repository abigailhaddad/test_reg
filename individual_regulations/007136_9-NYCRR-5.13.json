Tit. 9 § 5.13 - Executive Order No. 13: Ordering the Director of the Division of Probation and Correctional Alternatives to Bar the Diversion Under the Probation-Eligible Diversion Program of Felony Sex Crime Offenders from State Prison Sentences. [*]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, it is the first obligation of government to\nprotect its citizens from crime and violence; WHEREAS, the Probation-Eligible Diversion Program, formerly\nknown as Operation 360, provides funding for enhanced community-based\nsupervision and treatment for probation-eligible, non-violent felony offenders\nwho have not previously been convicted of a felony offense and who otherwise\nwould have received state prison sentences; WHEREAS, the Probation-Eligible Diversion Program is\nintended to increase the available capacity in the correctional system for\nviolent felony offenders without jeopardizing public safety; WHEREAS, although certain felony sex offenses are not\ndenominated \"violent felony offenses\" under the Penal Law, they are often\ncommitted by means of violence and are highly traumatic crimes that inflict\ngrievous psychological harm even when their commission does not entail actual\nviolence; WHEREAS, the Probation-Eligible Diversion Program does not\npresently bar the diversion from state prisons of persons convicted of felony\nsex offenses; and\nWHEREAS, there is a high degree of recidivism associated\nwith sex offenses and public confidence in the Probation-Eligible Diversion\n\nProgram would be seriously undermined in the event that a felony sex offender\nwas diverted under the program from a state prison sentence and committed\nanother sex offense despite community-based supervision; NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby order the State Director of the\n\nDivision of Probation and Correctional Alternatives to issue all necessary and\nappropriate directives to bar the diversion under the Probation-Eligible\n\nDiversion Program from state prisons of felony sex offenders. Signed: George E. Pataki\n\nDated: April 28, 1995\n\nFootnotes\n*\n[Revoked by Executive Order\n\nNo. 5 (Eliot Spitzer), infra. ] [Revoked by Executive Order No. 9 (David A.
