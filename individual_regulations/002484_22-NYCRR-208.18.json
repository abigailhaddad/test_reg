  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 208.18 - Calendars of triable actions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThere shall be such calendars as may be\nestablished, from time to time, in the discretion of the Chief Administrator of\nthe Courts. These calendars may include: (a) (1)\n\nGeneral calendar. A general calendar\nis for actions in which issue has been joined. (2)\n\nPreliminary conference\ncalendar. A preliminary conference calendar is for the calendaring for\nconference of cases after issue has been joined for specific classes of cases\ndesignated by the Chief Administrator of the Courts. (b) Pretrial conference\ncalendar. A pretrial conference calendar is for actions awaiting conference in\na pretrial conference part. Actions shall be taken in order from the top of the\ngeneral calendar or preliminary conference calendar and placed at the end of\nthe pretrial conference calendar. (c) Reserve calendars. A reserve calendar\nis for actions in which a notice of trial, conforming to section 1301 of the\nNYCCCA, and a certificate of readiness have been filed. Upon the filing of such\nnotice in any action with the clerk, at least 10 days before the day fixed for\ntrial, the action shall be placed at the end of either the reserve jury trial\ncalendar or the reserve nonjury trial calendar, as the case may be. Where an\naction is placed on a reserve nonjury trial calendar but subsequently a demand\nfor a trial by jury is timely served and filed, the action shall immediately be\ntransferred to the end of the reserve jury trial calendar. Once placed on a\ncalendar, the action shall remain thereon until disposed of, stricken, transferred or otherwise removed. The calendars shall be deemed continuous and\nno change in the order of original placement shall be made except as provided\nin this Part, by court order or as may be required by provisions of\nlaw. (d) Ready\ncalendars. A ready calendar is for actions that have been transferred from a\nreserve calendar because a trial is imminent, for noticed inquests and\nassessments of damages and for actions in which any party appears in person. There shall be as many ready calendars with such classifications of actions as\nthe Chief Administrator shall direct. (e) Continuous calendars. In any court\nnot continuously in session, the calendars at the close of one term or session\nof court shall be used to open the following term or session, and actions on\nthe calendars shall retain their positions. (f) Military calendar. A military\ncalendar shall be utilized to hold in suspense an action that cannot reasonably\nbe tried because a party or witness is in military service. When it shall\nappear to the satisfaction of the judge presiding that a party to an action or\na witness necessary upon the trial is in military service, and is not presently\navailable for trial, and that a deposition cannot be taken, or, if taken, would\nnot provide adequate evidence, the case shall be designated \"military\" and\ntransferred to a military calendar. Any case on the military calendar may be\nremoved therefrom by further order of the court or by filing with the calendar\nclerk, at least five days before such date, a stipulation of the parties who\nhave appeared or a notice to restore, together with proof of service of such\nnotice on all other parties; except that if any party appearing in person seeks\nsuch restoration, he may apply to the clerk, who shall refer his application to\nthe judge in the appropriate calendar part for disposition upon such notice to\nall parties or their attorneys as the judge shall direct. (g) Calendar progression. With\ndue regard to the requirements of statutory preferences and of section\n208.20\nof this Part, when actions\nare advanced from one calendar to another they shall progress from the head of\none calendar to the foot of the next calendar and otherwise progress in order\ninsofar as practicable unless otherwise determined by the court.
