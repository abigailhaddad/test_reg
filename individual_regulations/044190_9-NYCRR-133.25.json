(b) In response\nto a violation of this Part, any provision of the Cannabis Law, and other\nrelated regulations, the office is authorized to take enforcement action or\nimpose sanctions upon a person found to be engaging in unlicensed cannabis\nactivities in violation of the Cannabis Law, this Part, or any other laws, rules or regulations.

The person shall acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the seized items at the time of such\nreturn; (3)\nthe office\nmay require that any books and records of all transactions involving the sale\ncannabis product and security, tracking, record keeping, record retention and\nsurveillance systems, relating to all cannabis at every stage of acquiring, possession, manufacture, processing, sale, delivery, transporting, testing or\ndistributing, be turned over to them for inspection, examination, or\naudit; (4)\nthe office may affix a\ncopy of such notice of violation and order to cease unlicensed activity on the\nfront window, door, or exterior wall of the location where such activity is\ntaking place. The notice and order shall be within five feet of the front door\nor other opening to such location where customers enter from the street, at a\nvertical height no less than four feet and no more than six feet from the\nground or floor. When an establishment does not have a direct entrance from the\nstreet, the person shall permit the office to post such notice of violation and\norder to cease unlicensed activity at its immediate point of entry in a place\nwhere potential customers or members of the public are likely to see\nit; (5)\nsuch notice of violation\nand order to cease unlicensed activity shall not be removed, altered, covered, or defaced in any way except when authorized by the office.

(e) Having been\nserved with the above-mentioned notice of violation, order to cease and warning\nnotice pursuant to Cannabis Law section 138-a, without an order to seal\npursuant to Cannabis Law section 138-b, any person, as defined in section\n3, subdivision 40-a\nof the Cannabis Law, who is cultivating, processing, distributing, selling or\noffering for sale cannabis, cannabis product, cannabinoid hemp or cannabinoid\nhemp extract product, or any product marketed or labeled as such in this State, or engaging in an indirect retail sale, without obtaining the appropriate\nregistration, license, or permit must submit a verified affidavit of compliance\nattesting that the person has ceased the activity constituting the violation\nand, if applicable, complied with the office's order to cease within 10\nbusiness days of service of a blank verified affidavit of compliance on such\nperson. (1)\n\nSuch verified affidavit of\ncompliance shall be completed by the business owner, signed under penalty of\nperjury, and mailed to the office via certified mail to the mailing address\nreferenced on the notice of violation within 10 business days of service of the\nblank verified affidavit of compliance upon such person. (2)\n\nFailure to submit the verified affidavit\nof compliance within the timeframe required by subdivision (e) of this section\nwill result in the rebuttable presumption of continued unlicensed business\nactivity and subsequently subject said place of business and/or the\nowner/principal of the business to ongoing daily penalties of $20,000 per day\npursuant to section\n132\nof the\n\nCannabis Law for each day after the date of the notice of violation and order\nto cease unlicensed activity until such verified affidavit of compliance is\nsubmitted to the office. If a verified affidavit of compliance is submitted and\nthereafter the business and/or the owner/principal of the business is in\nviolation of any section of the Cannabis Law sections 101, 125, or 132, a\nrebuttable presumption of continued unlicensed business activity will have been\nestablished and said place of business and/or the owner/principal of the\nbusiness will be subject to ongoing daily penalties of up to $20,000 per day\npursuant to section\n132\nof the\n\nCannabis Law for each day after the date of the notice of violation and order\nto cease unlicensed activity. (f) The office may issue an order to seal the\nbuilding or premises of any business engaged in unlicensed activity pursuant to\n\nCannabis Law Section 138-b with an immediate effective date upon a finding of\nan imminent threat to the public health, safety and welfare and only if no part\nof the area to be sealed is used in part as a residence or is zoned for\nresidential use, and the unlicensed activity is more than a de minimis part of\nthe business activity. (1)\n\nThe following\nfactor(s) provide prima facie evidence that imminent threat to public health, safety, and welfare exists for purposes of an order to seal: (i) documented sales to minors; (ii)\nunlicensed processing of cannabis\nproducts at the building or premises; (iii)\nthe person engaged in the unlicensed\nactivity engaged in violent, tumultuous, or other behaviors indicating\nexpressed intent to not comply with the office's order to cease the unlicensed\nactivity; (iv)\ndocumented presence\nof unlawful firearms at the building or premises; (v) proximity of the building or premises to\nschools, houses of worship, or public youth facilities; (vi)\nproducts deemed unsafe based on reports\nof illness or hospitalization; or\n(vii)\ncannabis products not tested or labeled\nlawfully in accordance with the Cannabis Law, including unlicensed out-of-state\nproducts cannabis products offered for sale and not tested or labeled\nlawfully. (2)\n\nNothing in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision should be construed to limit these factor(s)\nto be used solely for the basis for an Order to Seal, nor should they be\nconstrued to be the sole factors in which the office may use to determine that\nan imminent threat to public health, safety, and welfare exists. (3)\n\nBefore issuing an order to seal, the\noffice will confirm that the area to be sealed is a commercial space and that\nno part of the area to be sealed is zoned for or lawfully used as a residence, and will note same on the order to seal. (4)\n\nThe office will assess whether unlicensed\nactivity within a building or premises is more than de minimis as indicated by\none or more of the following factors and will note any such factor(s) on the\norder to seal: (i) signs or symbols, indoors\nor out, advertising the sale of cannabis or otherwise indicating that cannabis\nis sold on the premises; (ii)\ninformation shared in any advertisements or other marketing content in\nconnection with the unlicensed business activity and any direct or indirect\nsales of cannabis or other conduct in violation of the Cannabis Law; (iii)\nthe volume of illicit cannabis products\non site; and\n(iv)\nthe variety of\nillicit cannabis products on site. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding the factors listed in\nsubdivision (f)(1) of this section and the restriction set forth in subdivision\n(f)(3) of this section, the office may issue an order to seal with an immediate\neffective date upon a second or subsequent inspection in which unlicensed\nactivity is confirmed to be continuing more than 10 calendar days after a\nnotice of violation and order to cease unlicensed activity was previously\nissued by the office, provided that the office has previously provided notice\nthat the business premises may be subject to an order to seal if upon a\nsubsequent inspection the office finds that the violation has not been abated\nas required by subsection\n13(a)(ii)\nof Cannabis Law\n138-a. (g) In the event\nthat the office issues an order to seal with immediate effect: (1)\n\nThe office will deliver any order to seal\nto the owner of the business or other person of suitable age and discretion in\nactual or apparent control of the premises at the time of the inspection and\nwill post the order to seal at the building or premises that have been sealed, secured and closed. The order will remain in effect pending a hearing and final\ndetermination of the board, or until such order is vacated by the office. An\norder to seal will explicitly state the procedures to request an emergency\nhearing on the order to seal within seven (7) calendar days and the right to\nhave the emergency hearing on the order to seal held within three (3) business\ndays of a request. (2)\n\nThe office\nwill mail a copy, by certified mail, of any order to seal issued by the office\nor board within five (5) days following issuance of such order to any address\nfor the owner of the business to the extent such address is provided by the\nperson to whom such order to seal was delivered and to the person in whose name\nthe real estate affected by the order is recorded in the office of the city\nregister or the county clerk, as the case may be, who will be presumed to be\nthe owner thereof. Such mailing will constitute notice to the owner and will be\ndeemed to be complete upon such mailing by the office. (3)\n\nThe office will post a copy of the order\nto seal in a conspicuous place or upon one or more of the principal doors at\nentrances of such premises where the unlicensed activity is being conducted, maintained, or permitted. In addition, the office will affix, in a conspicuous\nplace or upon one or more of the principal doors at entrances of such premises, a printed notice that the premises have been closed by order of the board, and\nthe name of the officer or agency posting the notice. (4)\n\nSuch posted order to seal and secure\npadlock or other device used to seal the premises or building shall not be\nremoved or mutilated. Any removal or mutilation of such posted order to seal or\nsecure padlock or other device used to seal the premises or building in any way\nwhile it remains in force shall constitute a violation of these regulations and\nshall be punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 in accordance with subdivision 1\nof section\n16\nof the Cannabis\n\nLaw. (5)\n\nAny order to seal issued\nby the office of the board pursuant to these procedures shall be effective for\none (1) year from the later of the posting of the order or the date of the\njudgment regarding the order to seal. An order to seal may only be removed by\nthe office or local law enforcement acting pursuant to local law consistent\nwith this Part. (h) Emergency hearings for orders to seal. (1)\n\nTo\nrequest an emergency hearing on an order to seal, respondent must follow the\nprocedure noted on the order to seal and must request an emergency hearing\nwithin seven (7) calendar days of the date of the order to seal. If respondent\nfails to request such emergency hearing within seven (7) calendar days, then\nrespondent waives the right to an emergency hearing pursuant to this section\nand will be entitled to a regular hearing pursuant to section\n133.10\nof this Part. (2)\n\nAt the time of requesting an emergency\nhearing on an order to seal and as a condition to proceeding with such\nemergency hearing, the respondent must provide the information required by the\nverified statement of ownership information set forth in section\n133.15\nof this Part. No emergency\nhearing on an order to seal will be scheduled until the respondent submits the\nverified statement. (3)\n\nIf the\nrespondent requests an emergency hearing on an order to seal and provides a\nverified statement of ownership pursuant to section\n133.15\nof this Part at the time of\nrequesting a hearing, the Office of Administrative Hearings will schedule an\nemergency hearing on the order to seal only with an administrative law judge to\nbe held within three (3) business days of a request for such emergency hearing, unless otherwise adjourned by agreement of the parties. (4)\n\nThe administrative law judge holding the\nemergency hearing will render an emergency hearing determination on the order\nto seal only within four (4) business days of the conclusion of such emergency\nhearing. Following a determination on the order to seal, which shall be\neffective immediately, either party may request a hearing be scheduled on the\nunderlying violations pursuant to sections\n133.10\n(a) and\n133.10\n(e) of this\n\nPart. (5)\n\nRespondent's failure to\nappear at the emergency hearing on the order to seal will result in a default, and the order to seal will remain in effect for up to one (1) year unless\notherwise vacated. (6)\n\nIf at any\ntime a respondent submits evidence of sufficient quality and quantity to the\noffice or the board pursuant to the process established by the office, including an affidavit and such other proof that the office or the board is\nsatisfied that the unlicensed activity has been abated in its entirety, an\norder to seal will be vacated by the office or the board. (7)\n\nOnly with respect to cases involving an\norder to seal, if respondent vacates the building or premises subject to an\norder to seal issued by the office or board, or if the building owner provides\nevidence of sufficient veracity that the building or premises has been vacated, any action or proceeding filed in accordance with these procedures relating to\nsuch building or premises will be withdrawn by the office or the board without\nprejudice, and any order to seal will be vacated. Sufficient evidence may\ninclude an affidavit or affirmation under penalties of perjury that the\nlandlord will not rent, lease, sublet or otherwise permit the building or\npremises subject to the order to seal to be used by future tenants for or in\nconnection with the sale of cannabis or cannabis products without such tenant\nfirst providing proof that tenant has obtained a license from the office to\nengage in that activity, or the landlord will be subject to civil penalties\nunder the New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law. (8)\n\nAn order vacating an order to seal will\ninclude a provision authorizing the office, or any police officer or peace\nofficer who assisted with the execution of the order to seal, to inspect the\nbuilding or premises without notice for the purpose of ascertaining whether or\nnot the unlicensed activity has been abated. Notwithstanding the independent\nauthority of any local law enforcement with respect to orders to seal, the\noffice may request that any police officer or peace officer with jurisdiction\nto assist in the enforcement of an order vacating an order to\nseal. (i) A party may\nrequest, or the office may initiate, an administrative proceeding to enforce an\norder to cease the unlicensed activity and order a financial penalty that the\noffice assessed for the violation. The proceeding will be subject to articles 3\nand 4 of the State Administrative Procedure Act and sections\n133.10\n(a) and (e), 133.11, 133.12\n(a) and (c), 133.13, 133.14, 133.15\n(a) and (c), 133.16, 133.17, 133.18, 133.19, 133.20\nand\n133.21\nof this Part. Any references\nto \"licensee\" in such sections shall be read to apply to persons subject to\nenforcement pursuant to this section. (1)\n\nNotwithstanding subdivision (f) of section\n133.10\nof this Part and pursuant to\nsubdivision 3 of section\n17\nof the Cannabis\n\nLaw, the notice of hearing may provide for a hearing date on less than 45\ncalendar days' notice. (2)\n\nAfter\nthe hearing, the administrative law judge shall issue a decision based on the\nadministrative law judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Such\ndecision shall be final and binding when issued. (j) In assessing the civil penalties under\n\nCannabis Law section 132(1) or 132(1-a), an affidavit from a representative of\nthe office, the office of the attorney general, or a local government, or a\nlocal police officer confirming the presence of conduct described in Cannabis\n\nLaw section 132(1) or 132(1-a) following an inspection by the office after the\noffice has ordered such conduct to cease shall be sufficient to establish a\nprima facie case that such conduct had been continuing for each business day\nbetween the initial inspection and the last observed or otherwise documented\nconduct. (k) Any of the parties may\nappeal the administrative law judge decision within thirty (30) calendar days\nof receipt. Such an appeal shall be made by filing with the board, and serving\non the other party or parties, a written memorandum stating the appellant's\narguments and setting forth specifically the questions of procedure, fact, law\nor policy to which exceptions are taken, identifying that part of the\nadministrative law judge's decision and order to which objection is made, specifically designating the portions of the record relied upon, and stating\nthe grounds for exceptions. A party upon whom an adverse party has served an\nappeal may file and serve a memorandum in opposition and cross-appeal within 30\ncalendar days after such service. A response to a cross-appeal may be filed and\nserved within 15 calendar days after service of the cross-appeal. The failure\nof any party to respond shall not be deemed a waiver or admission. The record\non appeal shall consist of the evidentiary exhibits from and transcript of the\nhearing, and the memorandums of appeal, opposition, and cross-appeal. The board\nor the board's designee may, in their discretion, stay the effective date of\nthe decision, and shall, based solely on the record on appeal, either confirm\nthe decision in writing, make a written, superseding decision including a\nstatement as to why they have not confirmed the administrative law judge's\ndecision, or remand the matter to the administrative judge for additional\nproceedings.
