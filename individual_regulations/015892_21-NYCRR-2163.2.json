Tit. 21 § 2163.2 - Minimum program requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nGrants can only be made to selected eligible applicants who\nhave submitted an application which contains a plan that will enable the\ncorporation to determine that: (a) The\nproposed project or program will make home ownership or home improvement\naffordable to persons who cannot afford to purchase or improve homes by relying\nupon the ordinary, unaided operation of private enterprise. (b) There are criteria, satisfactory to the\ncorporation, which provide for maximum income limitations or a system of income\ntargeting designed to ensure that persons who purchase or improve homes which\nbenefit from financial assistance provided pursuant to the act, are persons\nwho, through the ordinary, unaided operation of private enterprise, would be\nunable to purchase or improve homes. (c) There are criteria, satisfactory to the\ncorporation, to ensure to the maximum extent feasible, that rental units in\ntwo- to four-unit structures (other than the unit to be occupied by the\nhomeowner) will be affordable to persons or families who otherwise could not\nafford to rent these new, rehabilitated or improved units if produced by the\nordinary, unaided operation of private enterprise. (d) The payments, grants and loans provided\nby grantees pursuant to the act will be supplemented by private or other public\ninvestment and the payments, grants and loans provided by the grantee are the\nleast necessary to make home ownership or home improvement affordable to the\nincome group to be served by the proposed project or program. (e) In the event that the proposed project(s)\nor program activities are undertaken by other than not-for-profit corporations\nor municipalities, then the individuals, partnerships or corporations\nundertaking those activities will agree to limit their profit in accordance\nwith a formula, satisfactory to the corporation, which has been established by\nthe grantee. (f) The proposed\nproject or program will provide assistance in an area which is blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating, or has a blighting influence on the surrounding\narea, or is in danger of becoming a slum or a blighted area because of the\nexistence of substandard, insanitary, deteriorating or deteriorated conditions, an aged housing stock or vacant nonresidential property, or other factors\nindicating an inability or unwillingness of the private sector unaided to cause\nthe construction, rehabilitation or home improvement for which payments, grants\nand loans under this program are provided. (g) Except as provided in subdivision (h) of\nthis section in the case of home improvement, funds will be recaptured if the\nhome buyer does not occupy the home as his/her principal place of residence for\na minimum of 10 years or for the period specified under the terms and\nconditions of a formula established by the eligible applicant as approved by\nthe corporation. At a minimum, the grantee will require home buyers to agree, in such form as the corporation may require (including, a mortgage and note\nsecured by the home) that in the event the home buyer does not occupy his/her\nhome for the minimum 10-year period, the home buyer will pay the corporation\nthe following sum (unless the corporation approves a different formula proposed\nby the eligible applicant): (1)\nif the home\nbuyer occupies his/her home for less than five years, then the home buyer must\npay the full amount of the assistance provided under the act attributable to\nthe home buyer's home; or\n(2)\nif\nthe home buyer occupies his/her home for at least 5 years but less than 10\nyears, then the home buyer must pay that portion of the assistance provided\nunder the act attributable to the home buyer's home reduced by 20 percent for\neach year that the home buyer occupied his/her home beyond 5 years and less\nthan 10 years. For purposes of this paragraph, occupancy during six months or\nmore in any year will be deemed to be a full year of occupancy, and therefore, the amount payable will be reduced accordingly for such year; and occupancy of\nfour months to under six months in any year will be deemed to be occupancy for\none half of a year, and therefore, one half of the amount payable per year will\nbe payable for that year. The amount to be repaid as provided in this subdivision may\nbe reduced by the amount that the home buyer has previously paid to the\ncorporation on the principal amount of any loan provided under the act\nattributable to the home buyer's home. In addition, if the resale price is less\nthan the home buyer's original purchase price plus the cost of any capital\nimprovements made by the home buyer, other than capital improvements for which\nassistance was provided in whole or in part under the act, or in the event of\nsevere hardship such as death of the owner, financial or natural disaster, the\ngrantee may propose a modification of the home buyer's agreement hereunder\nwhich will be subject to the corporation's approval.

At a minimum, in all home improvement project(s) or programs (unless the\ncorporation approves a different formula proposed by the eligible applicant), the grantee will require homeowners to agree, in such form as the corporation\nmay require, that the homeowner will occupy his/her home for the periods\nrequired or pay the corporation a sum in accordance with the formula set forth\nbelow. The corporation may require that the form of such agreement may include\na note and mortgage except that a note and mortgage shall not be required when\nthe assistance provided to a home owner for home improvements is less than or\nequal to $2,000 (irrespective of the number of units in the structure) and the\ncorporation approves different provisions for recapture of assistance by the\ngrantee which are not unduly burdensome and are reasonably enforceable. (1)\nif the total amount of assistance\nprovided under the act attributable to the homeowner's home is less than or\nequal to $5,000 (irrespective of the number of units in the structure), then\nthe homeowner will agree to occupy his/her home for a minimum period of two\nyears from the date of completion of the improvement, as such date is\ndetermined by the grantee, or to repay the full amount of the assistance\nprovided under the act; (2)\nif the\ntotal amount of assistance provided under the act attributable to the\nhomeowner's home is more than $5,000 but less than or equal to $10,000\n(irrespective of the number of units in the structure), then the homeowner will\nagree to occupy his/her home for a minimum period of five years from the date\nof completion of the improvement, as such date is determined by the grantee, or\nto repay the full amount of the assistance provided under the act; and\n(3)\nif the total amount of\nassistance provided under the act attributable to the homeowner's home is more\nthan $10,000 (irrespective of the number of units in the structure), then the\nhomeowner will agree to repay the assistance as follows: (i) if the homeowner occupies his/her home\nfor less than five years from the date of completion of the improvement, as\nsuch date is determined by the grantee, then the homeowner must pay the full\namount of the assistance provided under the act attributable to the homeowner's\nhome; or\n(ii)\nif the homeowner\noccupies his/her home for at least 5 years but less than 10 years from the date\nof completion of the improvement, as such date is determined by the grantee, then the homeowner must pay that portion of the assistance provided under the\nact attributable to the homeowner's home reduced by 20 percent for each year\nthat the homeowner occupied his/her home beyond five years and less than 10\nyears from the date of completion of the improvement, as such date is\ndetermined by the grantee. For purposes of this subdivision, occupancy during\nsix months or more in any year will be deemed to be a full year of occupancy, and therefore, the amount payable will be reduced accordingly for such year; and occupancy of four months to under six months in any year will be deemed to\nbe occupancy for one half of a year, and therefore, one half of the amount\npayable per year will be payable for that year. The amount to be repaid as provided above may be reduced by\nthe amount that the homeowner has previously paid to the corporation on the\nprincipal amount of any loan provided under the act attributable to the\nhomeowner's home. In addition, if the resale price is less than the homeowner's\noriginal purchase price plus the cost of any capital improvements made by the\nhomeowner other than capital improvements for which assistance was provided in\nwhole or in part under the act, or in the event of severe hardship such as\ndeath of the owner, financial or natural disaster, the grantee may propose a\nmodification of the homeowner's agreement hereunder which will be subject to\nthe corporation's approval.
