  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 219-2.4 - Operating requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Combustion\nindex. (1)\na combustion index of 99.9 percent\nbased on a running eight-hour average of readings, and 99.95 percent, based on\na running seven-day average of readings, must be maintained except as approved\nunder paragraph (2) of this subdivision, or section\n219-2.5\nof this Subpart. The\ncombustion index is determined by: CI =(CO\n2\nx 100/(CO\n2\n+ CO))\nwhere\nCI =combustion index\nCO =carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas, parts per million\nby volume (dry)\nCO\n2\n=carbon dioxide in the\nexhaust gas, parts per million by volume (dry)\n(2)\non a case-by-case basis, alternative\ncombustion index criteria may be established for any source subject to the\nrequirements of this Subpart which is demonstrated to be unable to meet the\ncombustion index criteria of paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Such\nalternative combustion index criteria will only be allowed in instances where\nthe source is in compliance with the provisions of section\n219-2.2\nof this Subpart. In no case\nmay such alternative combustion index criteria be less than 99.80 percent, based on a running eight-hour average of readings. (b) It must be demonstrated by a method\nspecific to the proposed facility and acceptable to the commissioner, that\nactual measurements indicate a temperature and residence time of at least\n1,800° F for one second in the combustion zone on a continuous basis, or\nequivalent. The demonstration must be based on a continuous 30-minute average\nof temperature measurements. (c) No\nperson may cause or allow emissions to the outdoor atmosphere having a\nsix-minute average opacity of 10 percent or greater from any emission point\nsubject to these requirements. (d) Auxiliary burners must be operated as necessary to comply with the requirements\nof subdivision (b) of this section at the following times: (1)\nfurnace startup prior to introduction of\nmunicipal solid waste; (2)\nfurnace\nshutdown when municipal solid waste feed has been discontinued until complete\nburnout in the furnace has occurred; (3)\nwhen processing marginally combustible\nwaste, during periods of malfunction, or any other time when the requirements\nof subdivision (b) of this section cannot otherwise be met, unless such\noperation is approved in accordance with section\n219-2.5\nof this Subpart; and\n(4)\nat such other times as\ndetermined to be appropriate by the commissioner. (e) Control equipment for reducing emissions\nof hydrogen chloride must be operated such that the flue gas temperature at the\noutlet from the control device does not exceed 300° F unless a demonstration is\nmade that an equivalent collection of condensible heavy metals and toxic\norganics can be achieved at a higher outlet temperature or through the use of\nalternate technologies. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n219-2.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
