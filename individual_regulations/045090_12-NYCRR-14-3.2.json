  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-3.2 - General rules for repairs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Authorization. (1)\n\nRepairs to boilers shall\nbe performed by an organization in possession of a valid National Board or New\n\nYork State Repair Certificate of Authorization and/or a valid ASME Certificate\nof Authorization. The repair organization shall have a documented quality\ncontrol program containing a description of the scope of work it intends to\nperform with supporting welding procedures and qualification reports in\naccordance with section IX of the ASME Code. Welded repairs of a routine nature\nas specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section may be performed\nwithout stamping by the repair organization of the boiler (Fig. 14-3 b) or\nsignoff of the repair form by the insurance company inspector. (2)\n\nStamping or nameplate application. When\nrequired by this Part, the nameplate or stamping (Fig. 14-3 b) shall be applied\nto the repaired boiler adjacent to the original manufacturer's stamping or\nnameplate. The letters shall be at least 5/32 inch high. Image\n(b) Examples of repairs. Repairs\nshall be work such as, but not limited to, the following examples: (1)\nwelded repairs or replacements of\npressure parts or attachments that have failed in a weld or in the base\nmaterial; (2)\nthe addition of\nwelded attachments to pressure parts such as, but not limited to: (i) studs for insulation or refractory\nlining; (ii)\nhex steel or expanded\nmetal for refractory lining; (iii)\nladder clips; (iv)\nbrackets; (v) tray support\nrings; (vi)\ncorrosion-resistant\nstrip lining; (vii)\ncorrosion-resistant weld overlay; and\n(viii)\nweld build-up of wasted\nareas; (3)\nreplacement\nof heat exchanger tube sheets in accordance with the original design; (4)\nreplacement of boiler or heat exchanger\ntubes where welding is involved; (5)\nin a boiler, a change in the arrangement\nof tubes in furnace walls, economizer or superheater sections; (6)\nreplacement of pressure retaining parts\nidentical to those existing on the boiler and described on the original\nmanufacturer's data report such as, but not limited to: (i) replacement of furnace floor tubes or\nsidewall tubes, or both, in a boiler; (ii)\nreplacement of a shell or head in\naccordance with the original design; (iii)\nrewelding a circumferential or\nlongitudinal seam in a shell or head; and\n(iv)\nreplacement of nozzles; (7)\ninstallation of new nozzles or\nopenings of such a size that reinforcement is not a consideration; (8)\nthe addition of a nozzle where\nreinforcement is a consideration may be considered to be a repair provided the\nnozzle is identical to one in the original design, is located in a similar part\nof the vessel, and is not closer than three times its diameter from another\nnozzle; (9)\nthe installation of a\nflush patch to a boiler; (10)\nwelding of gage holes; (11)\nwelding\nof wasted or distorted flange faces; (12)\nreplacement of slip-on flanges with weld\nneck flanges or vice versa; (13)\nseal welding of butt straps and rivets; and\n(14)\nthe replacement of a riveted section by\nwelding, subject to the administrative procedures of the jurisdiction and\nacceptance of the authorized inspector. (c) Repairs of a routine nature. Routine\nrepairs include, but are not limited to: (1)\nwelded repair or replacement of tubes or pipes and attachments; (2)\nthe addition of nonpressure attachments\nto pressure parts where postweld heat treatment is not required; (3)\nweld build-up of wasted areas; (4)\ncorrosion-resistant weld\noverlay; (5)\nreplacement of boiler\ntubes where welding is involved; (6)\na change in arrangement of tubes in\nfurnace walls, economizer or superheater sections; (7)\nreplacement of nozzles where\nreinforcement is not a consideration; (8)\nwelding gage holes; and\n(9)\nreplacement of slip-on flanges with weld\nneck flanges or vice versa where nondestructive examination of the welded\njoints is not a requirement of the applicable ASME Code. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-3.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
