(1)\n\nMinimum morbidity standards for valuation of specified individual contract health insurance benefits are as follows: (i) Disability income benefits due to accident or sickness. (a) Contract reserves. In establishing contract reserves: (1)\n\nFor contracts issued prior to January 1, 1965: The minimum standard is the standard used prior to that date provided it puts a sound value on the liabilities under the policy. Otherwise the 64CDT shall be used; (2)\nfor contracts issued on or after January 1, 1965 and prior to January 1, 1989: 64CDT shall be used; and\n(3)\nfor contracts issued on or after January 1, 1989 and prior to January 1, 2020, or prior to an earlier date if elected under subclause (4) of this clause: 85CIDA or 85CIDB shall be used. Each insurer shall elect, with respect to all individual policies issued in any one statement year, whether it will use 85CIDA or 85CIDB as the minimum standard. (4)\n\nAn insurer may elect to apply the minimum reserve standards in subclause (5) of this clause for contracts issued on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to January 1, 2020, provided such standards are applied to all contracts issued on or after the date elected. (5)\n\nFor contracts issued on or after January 1, 2020, the insurer shall use the 2013 Individual Disability Income Valuation Table (2013 IDI Valuation Table)\n1, which was adopted by the NAIC in 2016, with modifiers as determined in accordance with the standards of valuation of individual disability income reserves governed by Part 83 of this Title (Insurance Regulation 172). (6)\n\nWithin three years of January 1, 2020, or an earlier date that an insurer begins to use the 2013 IDI Valuation Table under subclause (4) of this clause, the insurer may elect to apply that morbidity standard for all policies issued subject to other valuation tables, provided that the insurer: (i) applies the morbidity standard to all in force policies and incurred claims; (ii)\nelects or has elected to apply the 2013 IDI Valuation Table to all claims incurred regardless of incurred date; (iii)\nmaintains policy records on policies issued prior to January 1, 2020 that include all data elements needed to utilize the 2013 IDI Valuation Table; and\n(iv)\nonce the insurer elects to calculate reserves for all in force policies based on the current morbidity standard, the insurer makes all future valuations on that basis. (b) Claim reserves. (1)\n\nFor claims incurred on or after January 1, 2001 and prior to January 1, 2020, an insurer shall use the 85CIDA with claim termination rates multiplied by the following adjustment factor: Duration\n\nAdjustment Factor\n\nAdjusted Termination Rates*\nWeek 1\n0.366\n0.04831\n2\n0.366\n0.04172\n3\n0.366\n0.04063\n4\n0.366\n0.04355\n5\n0.365\n0.04088\n6\n0.365\n0.04271\n7\n0.365\n0.04380\n8\n0.365\n0.04344\n9\n0.370\n0.04292\n10\n0.370\n0.04107\n11\n0.370\n0.03848\n12\n0.370\n0.03478\n13\n0.370\n0.03034\n\nMonth 4\n0.391\n0.08758\n5\n0.371\n0.07346\n6\n0.435\n0.07531\n7\n0.500\n0.07245\n8\n0.564\n0.06655\n9\n0.613\n0.05520\n10\n0.663\n0.04705\n11\n0.712\n0.04486\n12\n0.756\n0.04309\n13\n0.800\n0.04080\n14\n0.844\n0.03882\n15\n0.888\n0.03730\n16\n0.932\n0.03448\n17\n0.976\n0.03026\n18\n1.020\n0.02856\n19\n1.049\n0.02518\n20\n1.078\n0.02264\n21\n1.107\n0.02104\n22\n1.136\n0.01932\n23\n1.165\n0.01865\n24\n1.195\n0.01792\n\nYear 3\n1.369\n0.16839\n4\n1.204\n0.10114\n5\n1.199\n0.07434\n6 and later\n1.000\n**\n*The adjusted termination rates derived from the application of the adjustment factors to the DTS Valuation termination rates shown in exhibits 3a, 3b, 3c, 4, and 5 (Transactions of the Society of Actuaries (TSA) XXXVII, pp. 457-465) is displayed. The adjustment factors for age, elimination period, class, sex, and cause displayed in exhibits 3a, 3b, 3c, and 4 are applied to the adjusted termination rates shown in this table. **Applicable DTS Valuation Table duration rate from exhibits 3c and 4 (TSA XXXVII, pp. 462-463). The 85CIDA tables so adjusted for the computation of claim reserves shall be known as The Commissioners Individual Disability Tables C (85CIDC). (2)\n\nFor claims incurred on or after January 1, 2020, the insurer shall use the 2013 IDI Valuation Table with modifiers as determined in accordance with the standards of valuation of individual disability income reserves governed by Part 83 of this Title (Insurance Regulation 172), including: (i) the use of the insurer's own experience as determined in accordance with the standards of valuation of individual disability income reserves governed by Part 83 of this Title (Insurance Regulation 172); (ii)\nan adjustment to include an own experience measurement margin as determined in accordance with the standards of valuation of individual disability income reserves governed by Part 83 of this Title (Insurance Regulation 172); and\n(iii)\nthe application of a credibility factor as determined in accordance with the standards of valuation of individual disability income reserves governed by Part 83 of this Title (Insurance Regulation 172). (3)\n\nFor claims incurred prior to January 1, 2001, each insurer may elect one of the following to use as the minimum standard: (i) the minimum morbidity standard in effect for contract reserves on currently issued contracts, as of the date the claim is incurred; or\n(ii)\nthe standard as defined in subclause (1) or (2) of this clause, applied to all open claims, provided the insurer maintains claim records that include all data elements needed to utilize the standard defined in subclause (1) or (2) of this clause. Once an insurer elects to calculate reserves for all open claims on the standard defined in subclause (1) or (2) of this clause, all of the insurer's future valuations must be on that basis. This option, with respect to subclause (2) of this clause, may be selected only if the insurer maintains claim records that include all data elements needed to utilize the 2013 IDI Valuation Table. (4)\n\nFor policies with an elimination period, the insurer shall consider the duration of disablement as dating from the time that benefits would have begun to accrue had there been no elimination period. (5)\n\nAn insurer shall consider a new disability connected directly or indirectly with a previous disability, which had a duration of at least one year and terminated within six months of the new disability, to be a continuation of the previous disability. (ii)\n\nHospital benefits, surgical benefits and maternity benefits (scheduled benefits or fixed time period benefits only). (a) Contract reserves.

(3)\n\nFor claim reserves on policies not requiring contract reserves, the maximum interest rate is the maximum rate permitted by law in the valuation of single premium immediate annuities issued on the same date as the claim incurral date, reduced by 100 basis points. (c) Mortality. (1)\n\nUnless paragraph (3) or (4) of this subdivision applies, the mortality basis used for all individual policies and group certificates, except long-term care insurance individual policies or group certificates issued on or after January 1, 1997, shall be the table specified in the Insurance Law or other Parts of this Title (but without use of selection factors) as the minimum standard permitted, for the valuation of whole life insurance issued on the same date as the health insurance contract. For example: the 1980 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Table found in Report of the Special Committee to Recommend New Mortality Tables for Valuation Transactions of Society of Actuaries 1981, Volume XXXIII, pp. 617 through 669 (80CSO)[FN11] could be used on an optional basis as of January 1, 1981 and therefore for this purpose the appropriate date would be January 1, 1981.

(3)\n\nFor long-term care insurance individual policies or group certificates issued on or after January 1, 2005, the mortality basis used shall be the 1994 Group Annuity Mortality Static Table. Rates of mortality for such basis are shown in the qx\n1994\ncolumn of the 1994 Group Annuity Reserving Table contained in section\n99.10\n(i)(5)\n(Insurance Regulation 151) of this Title. (4)\n\nOther mortality tables adopted by the NAIC and promulgated by regulation by the superintendent may be used in the calculation of the minimum reserves if appropriate for the type of benefits and if approved by the superintendent for use by the insurer in calculating such reserves. The request for approval shall include the proposed mortality table and the reason that the standard specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision is inappropriate. (5)\n\nFor single premium and level premium credit insurance using the 85CIDA tables, no separate mortality table shall be assumed.
