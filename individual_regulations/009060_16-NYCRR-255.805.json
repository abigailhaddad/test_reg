  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.805 - Leaks: general\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any\nnotification of a gas leak or gas odor, or any notification of damage to\nfacilities by contractors or other outside sources shall constitute the need\nfor prompt action. (b) Each\noperator shall be responsible for the leak investigation, classification, and\nrepair of each leak found on its below-grade system and shall establish a means\nby which it determines the appropriate surveillance interval at leak locations\nunder frost conditions. (c) Leaks\nfound to be on exposed piping or facilities need not be classified; however, each operator shall establish procedures for immediate elimination of potential\nhazards resulting therefrom. (d) The purpose of the leak classification system is to determine the degree or\nextent of the potential hazard which results from gas leakage and to prescribe\nremedial actions therefor. (e) Classifications shall be made only by individuals who possess training, experience, and knowledge in the field of leak classification and\ninvestigation, including extensive association with actual leakage work. The\njudgment of the aforementioned individuals, based upon all pertinent\ninformation and a complete leakage investigation at the scene, will form the\nbasis for the classification. (f) Percentages of gas-in-air included hereafter are based on natural gas. Where\nliquefied petroleum, manufactured or other gases are involved, appropriate\nadjustment shall be made as may be required, consistent with the lower\nexplosive limit (LEL) of such gas or mixture of gases. (g) Prior to downgrading a leak without any\nrepair, at least one additional surveillance at the normal interval is required\nto verify that a lower class of hazard exists. Except for leaks downgraded to\ntype 3 classification, which do not require a time limit for repair, if a leak\nis reclassified to a lower hazard level, the original date of discovery\ndetermines the time period for repair. In no case shall the time limit for\nrequired repair of any leak exceed one year from the date of discovery. This\nrequirement does not apply to leaks classified as type 2 or 2A based on\nconsideration of frost conditions nor to leaks, at the time of discovery, classified at a higher level pending a further, more complete investigation of\nthe leak hazard area. (h) When a\nleak is upgraded to a higher hazard level, the time period for repair is the\nremaining time based on its original classification or the time allowed for its\nnew classification, whichever is less. This does not apply to leaks classified\nat a higher hazard level based on consideration of frost conditions nor to\nleaks, at the time of discovery, classified at a lower level pending a further, more complete investigation of the leak hazard area. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.805\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
