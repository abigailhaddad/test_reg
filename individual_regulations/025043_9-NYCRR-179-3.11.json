Approval\nby the director of the division of a resident's participation in any continuous\ntemporary release program also implies approval of the resident's participation\nin all other temporary release programs at the discretion of the temporary\nrelease committee chairperson and the facility director. No out-of-state\ncontinuous temporary release applications will be approved. (b) Types of continuous temporary release\nprograms. (1)\n\nWork release program. A work\nrelease program is a continuous temporary release program under which an\neligible and approved resident may be granted the privilege of leaving the\npremises of a facility designated for such purposes by the director of the\ndivision, for a period not exceeding 14 hours in any day, for the purpose of\non-the-job training or employment, or for any matter necessary to the\nfurtherance of any such purposes. (i) Facility staff and the temporary release parole officer shall assist residents\nwho are eligible and suitable to participate in a work release program in any\nmanner necessary to secure education, on-the-job training and employment\nopportunities and to participate successfully in the work release\nprogram. (ii)\n\nNo employment under a\nwork release program may be approved or continued: if such employment results\nin the displacement of employed workers, or is applied in skills, crafts or\ntrades in which there is a surplus of available labor in the locality; or if\nthe rates of pay and other conditions of employment are not at least equal to\nthose paid or provided for work of similar nature in the locality in which the\nwork is to be performed; or if there is any labor strike or lockout in the\nestablishment in which the resident is employed. (iii)\nA resident who has been approved to\nparticipate in a work release program, and who is unemployed, may be granted a\njob search furlough by the temporary release committee chairperson or the\nfacility director for the purpose of attending employment interviews or\nsearching for employment. Such a furlough shall not exceed eight hours'\nduration. These job search furloughs are not continuous and must be decided on\na case-by-case basis each time the resident requests such a furlough. A new\ntemporary release memorandum of agreement shall be prepared and signed by the\nresident each time he leaves the facility on a job search furlough. (iv)\n\nOn those days when the resident remains\nin the facility, he shall be interviewed by the facility vocational specialist\nor similarly trained staff member, or, in that person's absence, by his\nfacility counselor or the temporary release parole officer, his job search\nactivities evaluated, and future job leads developed. Any employment interviews\nscheduled for the resident shall be verified in advance whenever possible. The\nresident's job search efforts also shall be verified. (v) A temporary release participant may not\nbe employed by or with a codefendant, work at the scene of his crime, or be\nemployed by the same company if his crime was related in any way to his\nemployment, without the prior written approval of the temporary release parole\nofficer and the temporary release committee chairperson. (vi)\n\nThe temporary release parole officer or\nthe temporary release committee chairperson may disapprove an employment\nprogram if, in his judgement, the resident may have too great an opportunity to\ncommit a crime. (vii)\nA continuous\ntemporary release participant must receive the prior written approval of the\ntemporary release parole officer, the temporary release committee chairperson\nand the facility director, before he may become self-employed while\nparticipating in a continuous temporary release program. Such approval shall be\ngranted only in exceptional circumstances and shall be contingent upon the\nresident's compliance with all applicable laws and licensing\nprocedures. (2)\n\nEducational leave. Educational leave is a continuous temporary release program\nunder which an eligible and approved resident may be granted the privilege of\nleaving the premises of a facility, for a period not exceeding 14 hours in any\nday, for the purpose of educational or vocational training, or for any matter\nnecessary to the furtherance of any such purposes. In order for a resident to\nbe approved to participate in an educational release program, he must have\nsubmitted an application for admission to a program of study at an accredited\ncollege, university or vocational training program which has agreed to maintain\na record of his class attendance. In the case of a resident who must be\ntransferred to another facility in order to participate in an educational leave\nprogram, the resident must receive confirmation of his admission to a college, university or vocational training program prior to his transfer. (3)\n\nCommunity services program. A community\nservices program is a continuous temporary release program under which an\neligible and approved resident may be granted the privilege of leaving the\npremises of a facility, for a period not exceeding 14 hours in any day, for the\npurpose of participating in a volunteer or community services work\nproject.
