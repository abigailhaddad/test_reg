Tit. 20 §§ 8186-26.11 - Supplemental sample\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The initial\nresults of the sample estimate are analyzed in accordance with the following\nprocedures. If the coefficient of variation is larger than a predetermined\nvalue, a supplemental sample is required. For purposes of this section, initial results\nshall mean the determinations of a coefficient\nof variation and supplemental sample as computed from the original survey data, regardless of the first use of the survey data, except that data changes\nsubsequent to the original determinations that are incorporated into the survey\ndata prior to, but not at the same time as, completion of the supplemental\nsample have the following effect: (1)\n\nIf the\nmunicipality, borough of New York City, segment in a segment survey assessing\nunit, class in a special assessing unit or homestead assessing unit, school\ndistrict designated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law, or class in a portion\nin a special assessing unit or homestead assessing unit: (i) previously did not require a supplemental\nsample and the recomputed coefficient of variation does not exceed the survey\nlimit, no additional samples are required; (ii)\npreviously did not require a\nsupplemental sample and the recomputed coefficient of variation exceeds the\nsurvey limit, additional samples are required; (iii)\npreviously required a supplemental\nsample and the recomputed coefficient of variation exceeds the survey limit, new additional samples are required; (iv)\npreviously required a supplemental\nsample and the recomputed coefficient of variation does not exceed the survey\nlimit, no additional samples are required. (2)\n\nData changes occurring in an assessing\nunit in a county where a supplemental sample was required, subsequent to the\ncompletion of the supplemental sample, or in an assessing unit in a county\nwhere no supplemental sample was required, more than two months after the\ndetermination of the coefficient of variation and supplemental sample, will not\naffect the determinations of a coefficient of variation and supplemental\nsample. (b) The following\noperations shall be performed in the determination of the supplemental sample: (1)\n\nCompute the coefficient of variation for\neach municipality, borough of New York City, segment in a segment survey\nassessing unit, class in a special assessing unit or homestead assessing unit, school district designated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law, and class in a portion\nin a special assessing unit or homestead assessing unit: (i) During the computation of the market\nvalue ratio estimate pursuant to this Subpart, the contribution to the\ncoefficient of variation of the estimate, or CV, is also estimated for each\nvalue interval. (ii)\n\nFor the\ncomputation of the coefficient of variation for a class in a special assessing\nunit, each \"U\" interval is assumed to have a relative sampling variance\nproportional to its corresponding special assessing unit class relative\nvariance. For the computation of the coefficient of variation for a class in a\nnonspecial assessing unit, each \"U\" interval is assumed to have a relative\nsampling variance proportional to its corresponding municipal relative\nvariance. (iii)\nA coefficient of\nvariation is not computed for the utility class. \"S\" intervals for the utility\nclass are assumed to make no contribution to the sampling error since the\nintervals are not assigned their sample parcels by random selection\nmethods. (iv)\n\"T\" intervals make no\ncontribution to the sampling error. (v) All other \"S\" intervals contribute to the\nsampling error. (vi)\n\nThe estimated\ncoefficient of variation for each estimate is obtained by expressing the\nestimated standard error as a percentage of the ratio estimate. (2)\n\nDetermine the number of\nsupplemental sample parcels necessary with respect to each municipality, borough of New York City, segment in a segment survey assessing unit, class in\na special assessing unit or homestead assessing unit, school district\ndesignated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law, and class in a portion\nin a special assessing unit or homestead assessing unit. (i) If necessary, a supplemental sample is\ndetermined and the estimated coefficients of variation are tested in a\nmultistep process. The order of the steps is as follows: (a) New York City: (1)\nmunicipal level; (2)\nborough level; and\n(3)\nfor ordinary classes at the special\nassessing unit level. (b) Nassau County: (1)\ncity and town\nlevel; (2)\nschool district\ndesignated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law level; and\n(3)\nfor ordinary classes at the following\nlevels: (i) special assessing unit; (ii)\ncity or town; (iii)\nvillage which has adopted the\nprovisions of subdivision 3 of section\n1402\nof the Real Property Tax Law or\ntown outside village; and\n(iv)\nschool district. (c) Segment survey assessing units. (1)\nmunicipal level; and\n(2)\nsegment level for any segment for which\nan equalization product is determined for the purposes of determining actual\nvaluation pursuant to section\n3602\nof the Education Law or tax\napportionment. (d) Homestead assessing units: (1)\nhomestead\nassessing unit level; (2)\nfor\nordinary classes at the homestead assessing unit level; (3)\nschool district portion designated in\nformer 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law; and\n(4)\nclass level within a portion. (e) For all other municipalities, the municipal level. (ii)\n\nAfter the first step, the testing of the municipal estimated coefficient of\nvariation, any hypothetical reduction to the CV attributed to any supplemental\nsample required in the first step or subsequent steps is assumed to have\nactually occurred prior to the test for the next step. (iii)\n\nAt each step, the estimated coefficient\nof variation is compared to its corresponding CV limit shown herein. (iv)\n\nIf the CV is greater than the\nappropriate CV limit, the sample size of the \"S\" interval contributing most to\nthe CV is increased by one, the value interval contribution and CV are reduced\nhypothetically in accordance with sampling theory, and the adjusted CV is\nfurther tested against the CV limit. This process continues until the adjusted\nCV no longer exceeds the appropriate CV limit. If the initial CV estimate does\nnot exceed the appropriate CV limit or a minimum number of supplemental samples\nis not assigned, no supplemental sample is assigned for the step. The minimum\nsupplemental sample assigned is six for the following levels; municipal, borough, school district in a segment survey assessing unit, and school\ndistrict designated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law. (v) The CV limits are: (a) For New York City: CV\nlimit\n\nMunicipal-citywide\n2%\nBorough\n3%\n(b) For a class at the special assessing unit level the CV limit is 5\npercent. (c) For a municipality, a\nsegment in a segment survey assessing unit, and a school district designated in\nformer 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law: Estimated Market Value\nCV\nlimit\n0 to 64,499,999\n6.0%\n64,500,000 to 128,999,999\n6.0%\n129,000,000 to 257,999,999\n6.0%\n258,000,000 to 386,999,999\n6.0%\n387,000.000 to 515,999,999\n6.0%\n516,000,000 to 644,999,999\n6.0%\n645,000,000 to 773,999,999\n5.8%\n774,000,000 to 902,999,999\n5.6%\n903,000,000 to 1,031,999,999\n5.4%\n1,032,000,000 to 1,160,999,999\n5.2%\nEqual to or greater than 1,161,000,000\n5.0%\n(d) For the following classes at a portion level the CV limit is 10%: Class\n\nHomestead\n\nNonhomestead\n\nFor an ordinary class in a special assessing unit\n(3)\n\nSample\nparcels and possible alternates are randomly selected for each interval where\nsupplemental sample parcels are required. Sample parcels are appraised in\naccordance with this Part. (4)\n\nRecompute the estimated market value ratio in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in section\n8186-26.10\nof this Subpart, with\nthe inclusion of the supplemental sample parcels. (c) For assessing units using a classified\nroll and sample originally prepared for another survey and being reused for the\nmarket value survey, the supplemental sample determined for the survey\ncompleted first which uses the same classified roll and sample shall be reused\nfor the survey.
