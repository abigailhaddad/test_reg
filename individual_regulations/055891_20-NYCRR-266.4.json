  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 266.4 - Proration of allowable exclusion\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 12(d) of § 1340(c); Codes and Ordinances of the\n\nCity of Yonkers, § 92-109(d)\n\nWhere a taxpayer changes resident status to or from the\n\nCity of Yonkers during the taxable year, the exclusion allowable under section\n2(b) of the Model Local Law contained in section\n1340 (c)\nof the Tax Law and\nsection 92-99(b) of the Codes and Ordinances of the City of Yonkers must be\nprorated according to the number of months of the taxable year covered by the\n\nCity of Yonkers earnings tax return for the nonresident period. That is, the\nallowable exclusion will equal the amount which bears the same ratio to the\nfull amount of the exclusion as the number of months of the nonresident period\nbears to 12 months. For this purpose, a fractional part of a month will be\ndisregarded unless it amounts to more than one-half month, in which case it\nwill be considered to be a month. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n266.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
