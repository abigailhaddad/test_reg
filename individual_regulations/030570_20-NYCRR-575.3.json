  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.3 - Additional tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1402-a\n(a) In addition to the tax imposed by section\n1402\nof the Tax Law and described in section\n575.2\nof this\n\nPart, a tax is imposed on each conveyance of residential real property or\ninterest therein when the consideration for the entire conveyance is $1,000,000\nor more. For purposes of this section, residential real property means the\nfollowing premises that are or may be used in whole or in part as a personal\nresidence at the time of conveyance: a one-, two-, or three-family house; an\nindividual condominium unit; a cooperative apartment unit. When determining the\ntaxable consideration for the purpose of computing the additional tax, no\ndeduction may be made for continuing liens on real property or, in the case of\nthe conveyance of cooperative shares, for any mortgage on the property owned by\nthe cooperative corporation or any lien on the cooperative housing\nshares. (b) The rate of such tax is\none percent of the consideration or part thereof attributable to the\nresidential real property. The tax must be paid at the same time and in the\nsame manner as the tax imposed by section\n1402\nof the Tax Law and described in section\n575.2\nof this\n\nPart. Example 1: A three-family house is sold for $1,200,000. The grantor\ndid not occupy any portion of the house. The grantee is required to pay the\nadditional tax of $12,000 ($1,200,000 ×.01). The result would have been the\nsame if the grantor had occupied any portion of the house. Example 2: A building containing ten apartments $1,500,000. The\ngrantor used one of the apartments as a personal residence. This conveyance is\nnot subject to the additional tax since the real property conveyed is not a\none-, two-, or three-family house, an individual condominium unit or a\ncooperative apartment unit. Example 3: An individual residential condominium unit is sold for\n$1,000,000. The grantee assumed an existing $400,000 mortgage and paid $600,000\nin cash. For purposes of the transfer tax imposed by section\n1402\nof the Tax Law and described at section\n575.2\nof this\n\nPart, the grantor must pay tax based upon consideration of $600,000 because the\n$1,000,000 consideration is reduced by the $400,000 mortgage which remained on\nthe condominium unit. For purposes of the additional tax imposed by section\n1402-a\nof the Tax Law and described in\nthis section, the grantee must pay tax based upon consideration of $1,000,000\nsince no exclusion is allowed for the $400,000 mortgage. Example 4: A three-family house, one-third of which is used for\nresidential purposes and two-thirds of which is used for commercial purposes, is sold for $1,500,000. The commercial portion of the building is valued at\n$1,000,000 while the residential portion is valued at $500,000. In determining\nwhether or not the consideration for the conveyance is $1,000,000 or more, the\nconsideration for the entire conveyance must be taken into account. In this\ncase, the consideration for the entire conveyance ($1,500,000) exceeds\n$1,000,000 and, therefore, the conveyance is subject to the additional tax but\nonly on the value of the residential portion ($500,000). Example 5: A grantor constructs a two-family house which he then sells\nfor $1,000,000. The grantee intends to convert the house to two offices. The\ngrantee is required to pay the additional tax of $10,000 ($1,000,000 ×.01)\nbecause the property may be used as residential real property at the time of\nconveyance. After purchasing the property, the grantee does in fact convert the\nproperty to offices. He later sells the property for $1,200,000. No additional\ntax is due on the sale because the property, at the time of the sale, had been\nconverted to offices and is no longer considered to be residential real\nproperty. (c) Except as\notherwise provided in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, all of the\nprovisions of this Part relating to or applicable to the administration, collection, determination and distribution of the tax imposed by section\n1402\nof the Tax Law and described in section\n575.2\nof this\n\nPart shall apply to the additional tax imposed by section\n1402-a\nof the Tax Law and described in\nthis section with such modifications as may be necessary to adopt such language\nto the additional tax. Such provisions shall apply with the same force and\neffect as if those provisions had been set forth in this section except to the\nextent that any provision is either inconsistent with a provision of this\nsection or not relevant to the additional tax authorized by such section 1402-a\nand described in this section.
