  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 370.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nSections\n41\nand\n341\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw empowers the Comptroller to determine the amounts of service credited to\n\nTier 1 members of the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System and\nthe New York State Police and Fire Retirement System, respectively, and to\nadopt reasonable rules and regulations for the crediting of service with\nrespect to such members. While rules which pertain to service crediting of Tier\n1 member service have been in place for several decades, they have not\npreviously been published in a regulation. In view of the facts that the\n\nLegislature has, since the enactment of the Tier 1 provisions, enacted separate\nand distinct service crediting rules applicable to Tier 2, 3 and 4 members of\nthe Retirement System, and regulations have been promulgated with respect to\nthose tiers, there is a need to set forth, by regulation, the rules applicable\nto the crediting of service for Tier 1 members of the Retirement System. This\naction is being promulgated to publish the applicable rules with respect to the\ncircumstances under which a member shall receive full credit (a year of credit\nfor any 12 consecutive calendar months) and those under which credit for\npart-time service shall be prorated (less than one year of credit granted for\nany 12 consecutive calendar months). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n370.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
