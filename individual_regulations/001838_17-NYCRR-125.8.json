  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 125.8 - Drainage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A driveway\nshall be constructed so that it does not adversely affect the highway drainage\nor drainage of the adjacent property. The drainage and the stability of the\nhighway subgrade should not be impaired by driveway construction or roadside\ndevelopment. The functional drainage design of a construction project shall not\nbe compromised by field adjustments to compensate for driveway location\nalteration. In no case shall the construction of a driveway cause water to flow\nacross the highway pavement or to pond on the shoulders or in the\nditch. (b) Drainage collected by\nditches, gutters or pipes on private property shall not be discharged into the\nhighway drainage system unless expressly approved by the department. The\npermittee may be required to submit to the department a drainage study\njustifying the drainage system proposed and pipe sizes used. (c) Where construction of a driveway\nnecessitates crossing a highway ditch, a culvert pipe shall be installed in the\nditch by the permittee and the low point of the driveway profile shall be at or\nclose to the ditch centerline. On paved driveways, a corrugated metal pipe\n(C.M.P.) with a slotted top opening (or a grate) may be required to prevent\nwater from running out of the driveway and onto the pavement. A C.M.P. with a\ntop opening is impractical in dirt or gravel driveways or where debris may clog\nthe opening or the pipe. Under no circumstances shall existing ditches or\ngutters be filled without adequate provision for alternate drainage by the\npermittee. (d) Culvert pipe shall\nbe of a size adequate to carry the anticipated flow in the ditch as determined\nby the department and shall not be smaller than 12 inches inside diameter. The\nstructural material and gauge of the driveway pipe shall be adequate to\nwithstand the load from anticipated vehicular traffic across the driveway. Culvert length shall be determined as the sum of the width of the driveway at\nthe ditch centerline and the length needed to accommodate a sideslope of one\nvertical to three horizontal from the driveway to the ditch. Tapered end\nsections, instead of headwalls, shall be installed on the culvert to minimize\nits potential as a roadside hazard. End section requirements should reflect\ncurrent design policy. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n125.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
