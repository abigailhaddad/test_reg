  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.97 - Executive order no. 97: establishing the alcohol and highway safety task force\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe tragic consequences of alcohol-related accidents are\nwell known, with approximately 1,000 fatalities and a conservative estimate of\n20,000 serious injuries per year in New York State. Local, State and Federal\nofficials working in the area of public safety regard the drinking driver as\none of the most serious and preventable of public health and safety problems. The Federal Department of Transportation has recently identified the drinking\ndriver as the number one cause of death on the highway. The efforts of the\n\nLegislature, enforcement community, drinking driver programs, public education\nand alcoholism treatment agencies have attempted to meet this problem, but\nefforts have not always been conducted in a coordinated manner. Such\ncoordination can occur through a comprehensive analysis of alcohol-related\nhighway safety problems and a comprehensive coordinated State plan to alleviate\nthese problems. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby establish a task force, to be known as\nthe Alcohol and Highway Safety Task Force, to assist me in the design of a\ncomprehensive coordinated State plan to alleviate problems relative to alcohol\nand highway safety. I. Powers and\nresponsibilities. The Alcohol and Highway Safety Task Force will: -- undertake a comprehensive analysis of alcohol-related\nhighway safety problems in New York State; -- analyze different prevention, intervention and\nrehabilitation models which may effectively reduce the population of drinking\ndrivers and alleviate other alcohol and highway safety problems; -- investigate alcohol- and highway safety-related problems\nto determine the feasibility of coordinated and/or expanded services; -- investigate funding mechanisms to assure the development\nand maintenance of a comprehensive coordinated State program to alleviate\nalcohol and highway safety problems; -- prepare reports for the Governor and Legislature on the\nnature and extent of alcohol-related higway safety problems and the elements of\na comprehensive State response; -- cooperate in the preparation of legislation to promote\nalcohol and highway safety; -- collect and analyze data on the impact of Federal and\n\nState spending on alcohol and highway safety; -- coordinate State efforts for obtaining available Federal\nfunds for alcohol and highway safety; -- develop mechanisms to inform local government\nexecutives, legislators, police officials, judges, health care officials and\nother interested parties of efforts aimed at alcohol and highway safety. II. Membership. The Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol\n\nAbuse and the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles will co-chair\nthe Alcohol and Highway Safety Task Force. Additional members of the task force\nwill include: Superintendent of Division of State Police, Commissioner of\n\nDivision of Criminal Justice Services, Commissioner of Department of Education, Director of Division of Probation, Director of Division of Substance Abuse\n\nServices, Chairman of Commission of Correction, Commissioner of Department of\n\nHealth, Chairman of Governor's Traffic Safety Committee, Commissioner of\n\nDepartment of Transportation, and Commissioner of Department of Correctional\n\nServices. Other concerned groups in the public and private sector will be\nencouraged to participate as the work of the task force develops. The task force shall meet at the direction of the\nco-chairpersons and shall periodically report to the Governor on its\nactivities. The task force shall prepare and submit to the Governor, for his\nreview, a progress report by May first of each year. A comprehensive analysis\nand State plan will be developed by July 1981, which will include a statement\nof coordinated agency policy. The members of the task force shall receive no\ncompensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses\nincurred in connection with the performance of their duties.
