  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 387.8 - Application process\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe application process includes completing and filing an\napplication form, being interviewed, and having certain information verified\nand processed in a manner appropriate to the household's needs. (a) Expedited service. (1)\n\nThe following households meet the\ncriteria for expedited processing of their SNAP application: (i) Households with less than $150 in monthly\ngross income as computed by SNAP requirements, provided their liquid resources\n(i.e., cash on hand, checking or savings accounts, savings certificates, and\nlump sum payments) do not exceed $100; (ii)\n\nMigrant or seasonal farm worker\nhouseholds which are destitute households as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part, provided their\nliquid resources (i.e., cash on hand, checking or savings accounts, savings\ncertificates, and lump sum payments) do not exceed $100; and\n(iii)\n\nHouseholds whose combined monthly gross\nincome and liquid resources are less than the households' monthly rent or\nmortgage and utilities (including a standard utility allowance, as appropriate, in accordance with section\n387.12\nof this Part). (2)\n\nBenefits shall be issued to\nSNAP-eligible households who meet the criteria for expedited processing of\ntheir SNAP application according to the following standards: (i) For all SNAP-eligible households who meet\nthe criteria for expedited processing as set forth in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, SNAP benefits must be made available to the household as soon as\npracticable but no later than the seventh calendar day following the day the\napplication was filed. (ii)\n\nHouseholds who may meet the criteria for expedited processing include, but are\nnot limited to, residents of shelters for battered women and children, households entitled to a waiver of the office interview, residents of drug\naddiction or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation centers, residents of group\nliving facilities, homeless individuals and residents of facilities for the\nhomeless. However, such households must meet the requirements for expedited\nservice set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nAn expedited verification process shall\nbe used in the certification of applications processed on an expedited basis. (i) In all cases, the applicant's identity\nshall be verified through a collateral contact or readily available\ndocuments. (ii)\n\nAll reasonable\neffort shall be made by the social services district to verify, within the\nexpedited time standards, the household's residency, income status, liquid\nresources and all other factors required in this Part through collateral\ncontacts or readily available documentary evidence. However, benefits shall not\nbe delayed beyond the expedited time standard solely because these eligibility\nfactors have not been verified. Households who meet the criteria for expedited\nprocessing of their SNAP application will be asked to either furnish a social\nsecurity number (SSN) for each person, to apply for an SSN for each person, or\nto otherwise fully cooperate with the process for applying and obtaining an SSN\nbefore the second full month of participation. Households with a newborn infant\nmay have up to six months following the month the baby was born to supply an\nSSN or proof of application for an SSN. The applicant shall comply with the\nwork registration requirements detailed in section\n385.3\nof this Title, unless the\napplicant is exempt or the household has designated an authorized\nrepresentative. (b) Verification and documentation. Verification and documentation are required to establish the accuracy of the\nstatements or information contained in the application. Verification is\naccomplished through the use of documentation or a contact with a third party\nto confirm the accuracy of the statements or information provided by\nhouseholds. The social services district must give households at least 10\ncalendar days following the date of the application interview and notification\nof outstanding documentation to provide required verification. (1)\n(i) Mandatory verification. The following information shall be verified prior to\ncertification for households initially applying: (a) Gross non-exempt income. Gross non-exempt\nincome shall be verified for all households prior to certification. However, where all attempts to verify the income have been unsuccessful because the\nperson or organization providing the income has failed to cooperate with the\nhousehold and the social services district, and all other sources of\nverification are unavailable, the eligibility worker shall determine an amount\nof income to be used for certification purposes based on the best available\ninformation. (b) Alien eligibility. The social services district must verify the qualifying status of applicant\naliens as outlined in section\n387.9\nof this Part. If an alien\ndeclines to provide the social services district with his/her consent to\ncontact United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to verify\nimmigration status, the household must be given the option of withdrawing its\napplication or participating without that member. (c) Medical expenses. For households with any\nmembers who are age 60 or older or disabled, the amount of any medical expenses\n(including the amount of reimbursements) deductible under section\n387.12\nof this Part shall be\nverified, prior to initial certification, before the household can receive a\ndeduction for those expenses. Verification of other factors, such as the\npermissibility of services provided or the eligibility of the person incurring\nthe cost, shall be required if questionable. (d) Social security numbers. The social\nservices district shall verify the SSNs reported by the household by submitting\nthem to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for verification according to\nprocedures established by SSA. The social services district shall not delay the\ncertification for or issuance of benefits to an otherwise eligible household\nsolely to verify the SSN of a household member. Once an SSN has been verified, the social services district shall make a permanent annotation to its file to\nprevent the unnecessary reverification of the SSN in the future. The social\nservices district shall accept as verified an SSN which has been verified by\nanother program participating in the Income Eligibility Verification System\n(IEVS). If an individual is unable to provide an SSN or does not have an SSN, the social services district shall require the individual to submit Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security number, to the SSA. A completed SSA Form 2853\nshall be considered proof of application for an SSN for a newborn infant. (e) Residency. The residency\nrequirements of section\n387.9\nof this Part shall be\nverified except in unusual cases (such as homeless households, some migrant\nfarm worker households, or households newly arrived in a project area) where\nverification of residency cannot reasonably be accomplished. Documents used to\nverify other factors of eligibility should normally suffice to verify residency\nas well. Any documents or collateral contacts which reasonably establish the\napplicant's residency must be accepted and no requirement for a specific type\nof verification may be imposed. No durational residency requirement shall be\nestablished. (f) Identity. The\nidentity of the person applying for SNAP shall be verified. Where an authorized\nrepresentative applies on behalf of a household, the identities of both the\nauthorized representative and the head of household shall be verified. Any\ndocuments which reasonably establish the applicant's identity must be accepted, and no requirement for a specific type of document, such as a birth\ncertificate, may be imposed. (g) Disability. The social services district shall verify disability, as defined in\nsection\n387.1\n(m) of this\n\nPart, as follows: (1)\n\nFor individuals to be\nconsidered disabled under section\n387.1\n(m)(2), (3) and\n(4)\nof this Part, the household shall provide\nproof that the disabled individual is receiving benefits under titles I, II, X, XIV or XVI of the Social Security Act. (2)\n\nFor individuals to be considered disabled\nunder section\n387.1\n(m)(6)\nof\nthis Part, the household must present a statement from the VA which clearly\nindicates that the disabled individual is receiving VA disability benefits for\na service-connected or non-service-connected disability and that the disability\nis rated as total or paid at the total rate by the VA. (3)\n\nFor individuals to be considered disabled\nunder section\n387.1\n(m)(7) and\n(8)\nof this Part, proof by the household that\nthe disabled individual is receiving VA disability benefits is sufficient\nverification of disability. (4)\n\nFor\nindividuals to be considered disabled under section\n387.1\n(m)(5) and\n(9)\nof this Part, the social services\ndistrict shall use the SSA's most current list of disabilities considered\npermanent under the Social Security Act for verifying disability. If it is\nreadily apparent to the caseworker that the individual has one of the listed\ndisabilities, the household shall be considered to have verified disability. If\na disability is not readily apparent to the caseworker, the household shall\nprovide a statement from a physician or licensed or certified psychologist\ncertifying that the individual has one of the nonobvious disabilities listed as\nthe means for verifying disability under section\n387.1\n(m)(5) and\n(9)\nof this Part. (5)\n\nFor individuals to be considered disabled\nunder section\n387.1\nof this Part, the household\nshall provide proof that the individual receives a Railroad Retirement\ndisability annuity from the Railroad Retirement Board and has been determined\nto qualify for Medicare. (6)\n\nFor\nindividuals to be considered disabled under section\n387.1\nof this Part, the household\nshall provide proof that the individual receives interim assistance benefits\npending the receipt of SSI benefits; or disability-related medical assistance\nunder title XIX of the Social Security Act; or disability-based State general\nassistance benefits. The social services district shall verify that the\neligibility to receive these benefits is based upon disability or blindness\ncriteria which are at least as stringent as those used under title XVI of the\n\nSocial Security Act. (h) Social services districts shall verify all factors of eligibility for\nhouseholds which have been terminated for refusal to cooperate with a State\nquality control review and reapply more than 125 days from the end of the\nannual review period. Social services districts shall verify all factors of\neligibility for households which have been terminated for refusal to cooperate\nwith a federal quality control review and reapply after more than nine months\nfrom the end of the annual review period. (i) Household composition. Social services districts shall verify factors affecting\nthe composition of a household, if questionable. (ii)\n\nSocial services districts shall verify\nany other questionable information that has an effect on the household's\neligibility and benefit level. To be considered questionable, the information\non the application must be inconsistent with statements made by the applicant, inconsistent with other information on the application or previous\napplications, or inconsistent with other information received by the social\nservices district. The social services district shall determine if information\nis questionable based on the household's individual circumstances. (2)\n\nWritten\ndocumentary evidence is to be used as the primary source of verification of all\nitems except residency and household size. Residency and household size may be\nverified either through readily available documentary evidence or through a\ncollateral contact. Residency is to be verified by the social services district\nexcept where verification cannot reasonably be accomplished (such as in\nhomeless cases). When verification is not accomplished, the social services\ndistrict must document efforts to obtain verification in the case\nfile. (3)\n\nThe household shall have\nthe primary responsibility for providing documentary evidence to support its\napplication and to resolve any questionable information. The social services\ndistrict, however, shall offer assistance in situations where the household\ncannot obtain the documentation in a timely manner. Such assistance may include\nusing a collateral contact or home visit unless otherwise stated in this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nThe\napplicant's/recipient's case record shall contain appropriate written notations\nor photocopied or electronically-imaged documentation which supports\neligibility, ineligibility and/or SNAP benefit levels. This documentation shall\nbe in sufficient detail to assure the reasonableness and accuracy of the\ndetermination. (5)\n\nChanges reported\nduring the certification period shall be subject to the same verification\nprocedures which apply at initial certification, except as follows: (i) The social services district shall not\nverify income if the source has not changed and if the amount has changed by\n$100 or less per month, unless the information is incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent or outdated. (ii)\n\nThe\nsocial services district shall not verify total medical expenses which are\nunchanged or have changed by $25 or less per month, unless the information is\nincomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent or outdated. (6)\n\nAt recertification the social services\ndistrict shall verify: (i) A change in income\nif the source has changed or the amount has changed by more than $10 per\nmonth. (ii)\n\nPreviously unreported\nmedical expenses and total recurring medical expenses which have changed by\nmore than $25 per month. (iii)\n\nIncurrence of utility expenses separate from other shelter-related\ncosts. (iv)\n\nNewly obtained SSNs, changes in household circumstance, and any other information which is\nquestionable are subject to the verification standards that apply at the\ninitial certification of the households. (v) The social services district shall not\nverify income if the source has not changed, or if the amount is unchanged or\nhas changed by $100 or less per month, unless the information is incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent or outdated. The social services district shall not\nverify total medical expenses or actual utility expenses claimed by households\nwhich are unchanged or have changed by $25 or less per month, unless the\ninformation is incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent or outdated.
