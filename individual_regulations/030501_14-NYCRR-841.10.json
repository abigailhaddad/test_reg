Each program shall contain two peer groups, one upstate and\none downstate. (b) Billable services requirements and\nlimitations must be delivered in accordance with the provisions of the\n\nAmbulatory Patient Groups (APG) Clinical and Medicaid Billing Guidance, as\nincorporated by reference in this Title (hereinafter referred to as the APG\nManual), in effect at the time the service(s) was delivered. (c) Definitions. All applicable definitions\nand rules covering standardized APG pricing logic for New York State's Medical\n\nAssistance program are found at Title 10 NYCRR Part\n86\n-\n8. (d) APGs and associated weights. (1)\nAPGs shall be subject to periodic\nrevision; the most current listing shall be published in the APG Manual\navailable on the Office website. (2)\n\nThe Department of Health, in consultation\nwith the office, shall assign weights associated with all CPT and HCPCS\nprocedure codes that can be used to bill under the APG methodology. The office shall maintain and update a list of weights\nassociated with APGs as published in the \"APG Policy and Medicaid Billing\n\nGuidance\" manual on the OASAS website. Such list may include APGs not\nspecifically associated with addiction outpatient and opioid treatment\nservices, but which may appropriately be billed by providers subject to this\n\nPart. (e) Base\n\nRates. Base rates for addiction outpatient services shall be developed by the\n\nOffice, and subject to the approval of the Department of Health, in accordance\nwith the following: (1)\n\nSeparate base rates\nshall be established for each peer group. Base rates shall reflect differing\nregional cost factors, variations in patient population and service delivery, available funding levels, and capital expenditures; (2)\n\nAdditional discrete base rates may be\ndeveloped by the Office for such peer groups as may be established by\nregulation in this Part; and\n(3)\n\nBase rates may be periodically adjusted to reflect changes in provider case\nmix, service costs and other factors as determined by the Office. (4)\n\nAll base rates established by the Office\nshall be published on the Office's website. (f) System Updating. The following elements\nof the APG rate-setting system shall be reviewed at least annually, with all\nchanges posted on the New York State Department of Health's website: (1)\n\nThe listing of reimbursable APGs and\nassociated weights, (2)\n\nThe\napplicable International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related\n\nHealth Problems, as incorporated by reference in this Title (ICD),-10 codes, or\nsubsequent ICD categorization, utilized in the APG software system, (3)\n\nThe Applicable CPT/HCPCS codes utilized\nin the APG software system; and\n(4)\n\nThe APG software system's grouping and pricing logic. (g) Bundled payment for opioid treatment\nprogram (OTP) services. (1)\nOASAS will\nestablish regional weekly bundled payments for freestanding opioid treatment\nprograms. Such payments will be available as an alternative to the\nreimbursement under the Ambulatory Patient Group (APG) fee methodology already\nin place for OTPs. Programs may bill any given week of OTP service for any\ngiven patient under either methodology (APGs or the bundled payment\nmethodology), but not both. The initial bundled fees shall be effective March\n16, 2020. (2)\n\nFor purposes of these\nbundled payments there will be two regions, downstate and upstate, with the\nregional assignment based on program location. The downstate region includes\nthe following counties: New York, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Bronx, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess and Orange. The upstate region\nincludes all other counties in the State. (3)\n\nThe proposed bundled payments are based\non service delivery that mirrors a subset of the Medicare OTP bundles in terms\nof both services and practitioners, as well as in terms of cost by practitioner\nfor each service. Services covered by the bundled payment include: FDA-approved\nopioid agonist and antagonist treatment medications, dispensing and\nadministering medications, substance use disorder counseling, individual and\ngroup therapy, toxicology testing, intake activities, and periodic\nassessments. (4)\n\nWeekly fees shall\nbe established in the following rate code classifications: (i) Methadone Dispensing and/or Counseling -\nThis code covers all of the services listed above for a patient being treated\nwith Methadone. (ii)\n\nMethadone Take\n\nHome - This code is billable when the patent has a supply of take-home\nmedication in their possession for the week being billed. It cannot be billed\nfor the same week as the dispensing and/or counseling code. (iii)\n\nBuprenorphine Dispensing and/or\n\nCounseling - This code covers all of the services listed above for a patient\nbeing treated with Buprenorphine. (iv)\n\nBuprenorphine Take Home - This code is\nbillable when the patent has a supply of take-home medication in their\npossession for the week being billed. It cannot be billed for the same week as\nthe dispensing and/or counseling code. (5)\n\nThe initial bundled payments, effective\n\nMarch 16, 2020, shall be calculated by using the unregionalized Medicare fees\nfor the same services, meaning those fees shall not vary by region. (6)\n\nEffective August 2, 2021 the fees shall\nbe regionalized using the OASAS OTP regional factor of 1.1700 (Downstate\nrelative to Upstate) for freestanding facilities. The regional factor shall be\napplied on a budget neutral basis assuming that the Downstate region would have\n94.41% of the methadone bundle service volume based on a historical volume\ncalculation by the Office. The medication take home fees shall continue to be\nidentical to those used by Medicare, and, as with Medicare, not\nregionalized. (7)\n\nThe Office, may, at its discretion, periodically update the bundled fees using trends, actual\ncost, Medicare benchmarking, program modeling, or some combination of these\ntechniques - subject to available funding, Federal approval, and NYS Division\nof the Budget approval.
