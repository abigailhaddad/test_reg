  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 371.2 - Criteria for identifying the characteristics of hazardous waste and for listing hazardous wastes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Criteria for identifying the characteristics of hazardous waste. The commissioner will identify and define a characteristic\nof hazardous waste in addition to those characteristics already identified in\nsection\n371.3\nof this Part, upon\ndetermining that: (1)\na solid waste\nthat exhibits the characteristic may: (i) cause, or significantly contribute to, an increase in mortality or an increase\nin serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness; or\n(ii)\npose a substantial present or potential\nhazard to human health or the environment when it is improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of or otherwise managed; and\n(2)\nthe characteristic can be: (i) measured by an available standardized\ntest method which is reasonably within the capability of generators of solid\nwaste or private sector laboratories that are available to serve generators of\nsolid waste; or\n(ii)\nreasonably\ndetected by generators of solid waste through their knowledge of their\nwaste. (3)\n\nWhenever a\nproposed characteristic of a hazardous waste has been identified by the\ncommissioner, the adoption of the proposed characteristic is subject to the\napproval of the State Environmental Board. (b) Criteria for listing hazardous\nwaste. (1)\n\nThe commissioner shall list\na solid waste as a hazardous waste only upon determining that the solid waste\nmeets one of the following criteria: (i) The\nsolid waste exhibits any of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified\nin section\n371.3\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nThe solid waste has been found to be\nfatal to humans in low doses or, in the absence of data on human toxicity, it\nhas been shown in studies to have an oral LD 50 toxicity (rat) of less than 50\nmilligrams per kilogram, an inhalation LC 50 toxicity (rat) of less than 2\nmilligrams per liter, or a dermal LD 50 toxicity (rabbit) of less than 200\nmilligrams per kilogram, or is otherwise capable of causing or significantly\ncontributing to an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating\nreversible, illness. (Waste listed in accordance with the criteria will be\ndesignated acute hazardous waste.)\n(iii)\n\nThe solid waste contains any of the\ntoxic constituents listed in Appendix 23, infra, and, after\nconsidering the following factors, the commissioner concludes that the waste is\ncapable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or\nthe environment when improperly treated, stored, transported or disposed of, or\notherwise managed: (a) the nature of the\ntoxicity presented by the constituent; (b) the concentration of the constituent in\nthe waste; (c) the potential of the\nconstituent or any toxic degradation product of the constituent to migrate from\nthe waste into the environment under the types of improper management\nconsidered in clause (\ng\n) of this subparagraph; (d) the persistence of the constituent or any\ntoxic degradation product of the constituent; (e) the potential for the constituent or any\ntoxic degradation product of the constituent to degrade into nonharmful\nconstituents and the rate of degradation; (f) the degree to which the constituent or\nany degradation product of the constituent bioaccumulates in\necosystems; (g) the plausible types\nof improper management to which the waste could be subjected; (h) the quantities of the waste generated at\nindividual generation sites or on a regional or national basis; (i) the nature and severity of the human\nhealth and environmental damage that has occurred as a result of the improper\nmanagement of wastes containing the constituent; (j) action taken by other governmental\nagencies or regulatory programs based on the health or environmental hazard\nposed by the waste or other constituent; and\n(k) such other factors as may be appropriate. Constituents will be listed in Appendix 23 only if they have been shown in\nscientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic\neffects on humans or other life forms. (2)\n\nThe commissioner may list classes or\ntypes of solid waste as hazardous waste if the commissioner has reason to\nbelieve that individual wastes, within the class or type of waste, typically or\nfrequently are hazardous under the definition of hazardous waste found in\narticle 27, title 9, of the Environmental Conservation Law. (3)\n\nThe commissioner will use the criteria\nfor listing specified in this subdivision to establish the exclusion limits\nreferred to in section\n371.1\n(f)(3)\nof\nthis Part. (4)\n\nWhenever the\ncommissioner proposes to list a solid waste as a hazardous waste where such\nsolid waste has not been so listed by the administrator, the listing of the\nsolid waste shall be subject to the approval of the State Environmental Board.
