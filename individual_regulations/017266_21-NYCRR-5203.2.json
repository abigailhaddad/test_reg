  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 5203.2 - Equipment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Intelligent\nworkstations (IWS). (1)\n\nAll PSAPs shall have\nthe ability to integrate multiple systems (CAD, IWS, and Mapping) into one\noperational system. (2)\n\nAll PSAPs\nshall have the ability to accept and process 10 digits of ANI information and\n20 digits (10 ANI and 10 pANI) of ALI information. (3)\n\nThe authority shall have a written\nprocedure for the use of a manual backup system in the case of failure of the\nCAD system. (b) Computer\naided dispatch (CAD) system. (1)\nA PSAP's CAD\nsystem shall accommodate call volumes and other sizing parameters as required\nby the authority. (2)\nA PSAP's\ncomputer system shall provide operational capabilities as required by the\nauthority. (3)\nA PSAP's CAD system\nshall have the capabilities of displaying the location of all wireless calls\nusing latitude and longitude, if a CAD based mapping solution is\nused. (c) Mapping program\n(other than CAD based). (1)\n\nAll mapping\nprograms shall be compatible with the IWS system. (2)\n\nAll mapping programs shall be able to\nplot and display X and Y coordinates provided by all wireless service\nproviders. (3)\n\nAll mapping programs\nshall be updated at least every three years to reflect changes in the PSAP's\ncoverage area. (4)\n\nAll mapping\nsystems shall display a map display which can be navigated based on address and\nlocation coordinates provided from the PSAP's ALI system. (d) ANI/ALI operations. All PSAPs shall: (1)\nhave enhanced 911 capability, including\nautomatic number identification (ANI) and automatic location identification\n(ALI); (2)\nhave the ability to\nreceive 20-digit ANI/ALI data from all wireless service providers; (3)\nhave dedicated redundant data links to\nthe designated ALI/ANI database providers; (4)\nhave the capability to receive the\nANI/ALI information as soon as the call is answered by a call-taker; and\n(5)\nhave the ability to re-bid\nfor ALI information. (e) Recorder system. The authority shall: (1)\nensure that all emergency communications to and from all PSAPs, including\ntelephone and radio transmissions, shall be recorded; (2)\nhave a written policy establishing\nprocedures for the playback and recording of emergency\ncommunications; (3)\nhave a written\npolicy for the securing and storage of recordings; (4)\nestablish criteria, and have a written\npolicy for, access to recordings; (5)\nretain PSAP recordings for at least 90\ndays; and\n(6)\nensure that instant\nplayback units are located at all call-taker positions. (f) Call detail record. All PSAPs shall have\nthe capability to provide an automatic call detail record (ACDR) of every\nemergency call received, either by recording equipment or CAD log. (g) Telecommunications devices for the deaf\n(TDD). (1)\n\nAll PSAPs shall meet all\nrequirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), including but not\nlimited to: (i) direct access for all\nteletypewriters (TTY); and\n(ii)\nequipping of each call-taking position with a TTY or TTY-compatible\ndevice. (2)\n\nThe\nauthority shall have a written procedure for the handling of silent or open\nline TDD calls. (h) Criminal justice information system. (1)\n\nAll\nPSAPs shall have direct access to the NYSPIN or eJusticeNY systems. (2)\n\nThe authority shall have a written\nprocedure for participation in the system or systems the PSAP\nutilizes. (i) System\nservice. The authority shall have a service agreement or agreements for all\nPSAPs, for the timely repair of equipment. (j) System clock. (1)\n\nAll PSAPs shall have a time\nsynchronization package for the purpose of coordinating system-wide timing\namong the various 911 systems and support systems. (2)\n\nThe time synchronization package shall\nprovide the means for wireless enhanced 911 systems, CAD systems, recorders, display clocks, and all other automated systems containing clocks to operate on\nthe same time source. (3)\n\nAll\nsystem clocks shall automatically adjust for daylight savings time and leap\nsecond, and shall have a time zone offset for UTC (universal coordinated\ntime). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n5203.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
