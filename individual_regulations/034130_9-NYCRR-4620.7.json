  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4620.7 - Big Nine\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Equipment. A\nwheel of variable size. The rim of the wheel is divided into sections, some of\nwhich bear different combinations of the numbers 1 through 9. Other sections\ndisplay a picture of a diamond, star and eagle. The wheel has a corresponding\nlayout. (b) The play. (1)\nA player places a wager on one or more\nnumbers or symbols on the layout and the dealer spins the wheel. When the wheel\nstops, the section in which the indicator arm rests is the winning\ncombination. (2)\n\nIf the player\nplaces a wager on the number 1 and the wheel stops at 1-1-9- 9-9, the payoff\nodds are 2-to-1 because the number 1 showed twice. If the wheel stops at\n1-1-1-4-4, the payoff odds are 3-to-1 because the number 1 showed three times. This holds true for all the numbers; e.g., if the player places his wager on\nnumber 5 and the wheel stops on 2-2-5-5-5, the payoff odds are 3- to-1. If the\nwheel stops at 5-5-5-5-5, the payoff odds are 5-to-1. (3)\n\nThe odds for the diamond, star or eagle\nshall be displayed on the layout. (4)\n\nThe maximum bet shall be $5 or its\nequivalent in chips. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4620.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
