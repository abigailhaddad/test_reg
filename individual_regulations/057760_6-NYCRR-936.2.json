  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 936.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In Table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters or portion thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in Table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portion thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage area, such as a river, large lake, bay or sound is usually referred to\nby name or an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary river waters are\nconsecutively numbered progressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of\nprimary lake, bay or sound waters are consecutively numbered in a clockwise\norder from a defined point, usually the outlet of the primary waters. Subtributaries are numbered as encountered along the tributary proceeding from\nits mouth to the source, and in like manner all of its other stream courses are\nso numbered. Ponds and lakes are numbered in the order they are encountered\nwithin the system. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered\nconsecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from\nits outlet or mouth. The numbers assigned to such lakes and ponds are prefixed\nby the letter P. When isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index\nnumber, it is merely for convenience of their identification and location\nwithin a subdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the waters under consideration by the New York State Conservation\n\nDepartment in its\n\nBiological Survey of the Lower Hudson\n\nWatershed\nin 1936 and has been closely followed in connection with the\nnumerical identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on the older maps employed by the Conservation Department at\nthe time of its 1936 survey but not shown on later editions of maps produced\nherein. Conversely, streams, lakes and ponds not shown on the older maps but\nappearing on the newer maps are designated by suffix letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nStreams that enter the\n\nState of Connecticut are identified by water index waters prefixed by the\nabbreviation \"Conn.\"\n(4)\n\nThe\nfollowing table will illustrate how the designated waters may be identified\nthrough the use of the waters index system: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\n\nConn. 4\n\nMianus River\n\nThe fourth stream crossing the New York-Connecticut\nboundary line proceeding northward along the boundary. Conn. 4-2\n\nTributary of Mianus River\n\nThe second tributary entering the Mianus River\nabove the mouth. Conn. 6-P 1109\n\nTrinity Lake\n\nThe 1109th pond, lake or reservoir encountered in\nthe biological survey area of the Lower Hudson River watershed. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs., indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, respectively, shall mean any\nstream, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, pond or other body of surface water; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated\nwaters shall include only the stream, pond or other body of water referenced by\nsuch waters index number; where a tributary, tributaries, subtributary or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, pond or other body of water\nreferenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries\nthereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\n\nTable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Description\nas appearing\nin Table I contains designations of segments or sections of waters under\nconsideration to which a particular assignment of a class and standards shall\napply. Also included in this column is any useful information pertinent to the\nclassification or standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in Table I, means map reference\nnumber and indicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced\nherein completely or in part, on which maps the specifically designated waters\nand their index numbers are shown.
