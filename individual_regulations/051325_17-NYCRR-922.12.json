(b) Setting of safety valves. Safety valves shall be set to pop at pressures not\nexceeding six pounds above the working steam pressure. When setting safety\nvalves two steam gauges shall be used, one of which must be so located that it\nwill be in full view of the person engaged in setting such valves; and if the\npressure indicated by the gauges varies more than three pounds they shall be\nremoved from the boiler or steam reservoir, tested, and corrected before the\nsafety valves are set. Gauges shall in all cases be tested immediately before\nthe safety valves are set or any change made in the setting. When setting\nsafety valves the water level in the boiler or steam reservoir shall not be\nabove the highest gauge cock. (c) Time of testing. Safety valves shall be tested under steam at least once every\nthree months and also when any irregularity is reported. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
