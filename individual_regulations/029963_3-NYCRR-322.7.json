Tit. 3 § 322.7 - Definition of well-rated foreign banking corporation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For purposes of\nthis Part, well-rated foreign banking corporation means a foreign banking\ncorporation designated as such by the superintendent. Such an institution must\nbe considered by the superintendent generally to be well-capitalized and\nwell-managed. The superintendent will consider the following factors, among\nothers, in making such determination: (1)\nwhether the parent foreign bank on a consolidated basis maintains a\nwell-capitalized position (currently, tier 1 and total risk-based capital\nratios of 6 and 10 percent, respectively, as calculated in accordance with\nstandards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision); (2)\nthe strength of support assessment (SOSA)\nrating issued by the Federal banking agencies; (3)\nthe composite rating for the foreign\nbanking corporation's New York office or offices (such rating should be no\nlower than a \"2\"); and\n(4)\nwhether\nthere are any formal supervisory, regulatory, or enforcement actions\noutstanding against the New York office or offices. (b) A well-rated foreign banking corporation\nshall promptly inform the superintendent if it becomes aware of the existence\nof any fact that could cause its loss of status as \"well-rated.\" The\nsuperintendent will also notify the foreign banking corporation of its loss of\nstatus as a well-rated institution when such determination is made. Upon a\nforeign banking corporation being informed by the superintendent that it is no\nlonger deemed \"well-rated\" for purposes of this Part, the foreign banking\ncorporation shall have 30 days to comply with the requirements of this Part\napplicable to those institutions not designated as \"well-rated,\" unless\notherwise directed by the superintendent.
