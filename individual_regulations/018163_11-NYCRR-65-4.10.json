(b) Qualifications of master arbitrators. (1)\nA master arbitrator shall be an attorney, licensed to practice law in New York State, who has at least 15 years' experience which the superintendent has determined qualifies such attorney to review and resolve the issues involved in no-fault insurance disputes. Documentation of such experience shall be submitted to, and reviewed by, the superintendent prior to appointment of a master arbitrator. (2)\n\nAll master arbitrators shall be appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, the superintendent. A master arbitrator candidate shall disclose to the superintendent any circumstance which is likely to create an appearance of bias or which might disqualify such person as a master arbitrator, and the superintendent shall determine whether the candidate should be disqualified. The superintendent shall forward the names of all master arbitrators to the designated organization, and promptly inform it of all additions to, and deletions from, the panel. (3)\n\nNo person shall, during the period of appointment as a master arbitrator, also serve as an arbitrator under the optional arbitration systems prescribed in section\n5106 (b)\nof the Insurance Law and section 65-4.4 or\n65-4.5\nof this Subpart, nor serve as an attorney to a party to any such arbitration. (4)\n\nAll master arbitrators shall take an oath of office. (5)\n\nNo person shall serve as a master arbitrator in any master arbitration in which such person has any financial or personal interest or bias. If a party challenges a master arbitrator, the specific grounds for the challenge shall be submitted in writing to the designated organization which, in consultation with the superintendent, shall determine within 15 calendar days after receipt of the challenge whether the master arbitrator should be disqualified. Such determination shall be final and binding. If a master arbitrator should resign, be disqualified or be otherwise unable to perform necessary duties, the designated organization shall assign another master arbitrator to the case within seven calendar days after receipt of notice thereof. (c) Scope of master arbitration review. (1)\n\nReview by a master arbitrator shall be based solely on submitted documents, including any record made of the arbitration below, unless a master arbitrator requires oral argument on specified issues. (2)\n\nLegal briefs shall not be submitted, unless requested by the master arbitrator. (3)\n\nThe master arbitrator shall initially consider and determine whether the facts alleged in the submitted documents set forth a ground for review pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section. (4)\n\nIf the master arbitrator determines that subdivision (a) of this section has not been complied with, the master arbitrator shall, in lieu of rendering an award, deny the request for review. The procedural requirements contained in this section applicable to a master award, shall also be applicable to a denial of request for review, but such denial shall not form the basis of an action de novo within the meaning of section\n5106 (b)\nof the Insurance Law. (5)\n\nIf the master arbitrator determines that subdivision (a) of this section has been complied with, the master arbitrator shall proceed to review the matter and render an award accordingly. (6)\n\nThe master arbitrator shall only consider those matters which were the subject of the arbitration below or which were included in the arbitration award appealed from. (d) Procedure for review. (1)\n\nIf grounds exist, pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, any party to an arbitration may request that the arbitration award be vacated or modified by a master arbitrator. (2)\n\nThe request for review by a master arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be mailed or delivered to the designated organization's master arbitration administrative office within 21 calendar days of the mailing of the award. The request shall include a copy of the award in issue and shall state the nature of the dispute and the grounds for review. A request by an applicant for benefits shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $75, payable by check or money order to the designated organization. A request by an insurer shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $325, payable by check or money order to the designated organization. The failure of a party to enclose the appropriate filing fee with a timely request for review shall result in a denial of the request for review by a master arbitrator if such payment is not made within 28 calendar days of the mailing of the award. (3)\n\nThe applicant for master arbitration review shall send, by certified mail, a copy of its filing papers to the opposing party at the same time that it submits the request for review to the designated organization. (4)\n\nWithin seven calendar days of receipt of the request, the designated organization shall assign a master arbitrator, selected in sequence from a panel of master arbitrators appointed by the superintendent, and shall forward to the master arbitrator a copy of the request for review. (5)\n\nThe master arbitrator shall render an award no later than 90 calendar days after assignment. (i) Submission of materials. Within 15 calendar days after assignment, the master arbitrator shall set a date (which date shall not be more than 45 calendar days after assignment) by which all evidence, documents and briefs, if any, must be submitted to the master arbitrator by the parties. The master arbitrator shall give the parties 30 calendar days' written notice of this date. (ii)\n\nOral argument. If after receipt of these materials, the master arbitrator determines that oral argument on specific issues is necessary, the master arbitrator shall give the parties 10 calendar days' notice of the place, time and date for oral argument and the issues to be argued. Oral argument shall be conducted at the office of the master arbitrator, the office of the designated organization or at a location agreeable to the parties and the master arbitrator. (iii)\n\nThe master arbitrator may postpone or adjourn the date for submission of materials or of oral argument to a date within the 90-day period for good cause shown. A postponement or adjournment shall also be granted when all the parties agree thereto. The postponement or adjournment shall not extend the 90-day period for rendering of an award. (6)\n\nThe failure of a master arbitrator to adhere to the procedural time frames, contained in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, shall not affect the validity of an award. (7)\n\nAny party may be represented in a master arbitration by an attorney. (8)\nA master arbitration shall proceed if any party, after due notice of the date to submit materials or date of oral arguments, fails to appear, to submit materials or to obtain a postponement or adjournment. However, an award shall not be made in favor of an appearing party solely on the default of another party. A master arbitrator shall direct the appearing party to submit such materials as may be required in order to render a decision in the matter. (e) Award by master arbitrator.

(2)\n\nAward upon settlement. If the parties settle their dispute during the course of the master arbitration, the master arbitrator shall set forth the terms of the agreed settlement in an award which shall provide that the parties agree that the settlement is final and binding and shall not be subject to review by a court or the subject of a de novo court action.

(2)\nA party who intends to commence an article 75 proceeding or an action to adjudicate a dispute de novo shall follow the applicable procedures as set forth in CPLR article 75. If the party initiating such action is an insurer, payment of all amounts set forth in the master arbitration award which will not be the subject of judicial action or review shall be made prior to the commencement of such action. (i) Master arbitrator's fee. The master arbitrator shall be compensated in the amount of $250 for each case. Such fee will be paid by the designated organization.

(ii)\n\nAn attorney shall be entitled to receive a fee of up to $80 per hour for oral argument before the master arbitrator, made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(3)\n\nNotwithstanding the above limitations, if the master arbitrator determines that the issues in dispute were of such a novel or unique nature as to require extraordinary skills or services, the master arbitrator may award an attorney's fee in excess of the limitations set forth above. An excess fee award shall detail the specific novel or unique nature of the dispute which justifies the award. (4)\n\nThe attorney's fee for services rendered in connection with a court adjudication of a dispute de novo, as provided in section\n5106 (c)\nof the Insurance Law, or in a court appeal from a master arbitration award and any further appeals, shall be fixed by the court adjudicating the matter. (5)\n\nNo attorney shall demand, request or receive from the insurer any payment or fee in excess of the fees permitted by this subdivision for services rendered with respect to a no-fault master arbitration dispute. (k) Financing. (1)\n\nThe cost of administering the master arbitration system over and above the amount of fees paid by applicants and insurers shall be paid annually by insurers to the designated organization upon receipt of a statement therefrom. This cost shall be distributed among insurers in an equitable manner approved by the superintendent. This distribution shall, to the extent practicable, be a function of the degree to which an insurer is a party to arbitration proceedings.

The committee shall notify the designated organization and the superintendent whether it accepts the designated organization's accounting in whole or in part. In the event the designated organization and the committee cannot resolve any differences that may exist, the dispute will be referred to the superintendent for resolution. The superintendent's decision shall be binding on the designated organization and insurers. (4)\n\nOnce the designated organization submits a final accounting that has either been approved by the committee or resolved, in the event of a dispute, by the superintendent, the designated organization shall send to each insurer a bill for the amount due or a refund for the amount credited, based upon the number of master arbitrations to which the insurer was a party.
