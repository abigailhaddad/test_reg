  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2390.1 - Requirement of power of attorney\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\nA\npower of attorney may be required before the Division of Taxation will rely\nupon a representative to obligate or bind a taxpayer. Except as otherwise\nprovided by law or this Title, a power of attorney may also be required before\nan individual may appear on behalf of a taxpayer, or be recognized by the\ndivision, in any matter that is subject to applicable Federal, State or other\njurisdictional confidentiality or secrecy laws. (2)\n\nThe division may require a power of\nattorney at such other times as it deems necessary to protect the interests of\nthe State or a taxpayer. (3)\n\nThe\nprovisions of this section apply to all powers of attorney filed with the\n\nDivision of Taxation of the Department of Taxation and Finance. (b) (1)\nA power of attorney will not be required\nwhen an individual appears with the taxpayer or with an individual who is\nauthorized to act on behalf of the taxpayer. For example, a power of attorney\nwill not be required when an individual appears before the division with\nanother individual who has filed a power of attorney, in proper form, executed\nby the taxpayer (\ni.e., an attorney-in-fact) or with an\nindividual who is authorized to execute a power of attorney on behalf of the\ntaxpayer (\ne.g., an authorized corporate officer). (2)\nA power of attorney will not be required\nwhen an individual merely furnishes information to the division or prepares a\nreport or return as a preparer for the taxpayer. (c) (1)\nA\npower of attorney may be filed on a form prescribed by the Division of Taxation\nfor this purpose or on a form prescribed by article 5 of title 15 of the New\n\nYork General Obligations Law. (2)\n\nThe division will accept a power of attorney on other forms provided the power\nof attorney satisfies the requirements of this section. (3)\n\nThe division may, in its discretion, accept a copy of a power of attorney. The division may also require proof of\nthe existence and validity of the original power of attorney. (d) (1)\n\nIn addition to any other information that\nmay be required by the division, a power of attorney should contain the\nfollowing information: (i) the name and\nmailing address of the taxpayer; (ii)\nthe identification number of the\ntaxpayer (\ni.e., social security number or employer\nidentification number); (iii)\nthe\nname and mailing address of the representative(s); (iv)\na description of the matter(s) for which\nthe representative is authorized to act which, if applicable, should identify\nthe type of tax(es) and the specific year(s) or period(s) involved; and\n(v) if applicable, a clear\nexpression of the taxpayer's intent to limit the authority conveyed. (2)\n\nIf a power of attorney\ndesignates only a specific tax or taxes and no period therefor, then the power\nof attorney may be accepted by the division as including representation for the\nspecified tax or taxes for all periods. If a power of attorney designates only\na specific period or periods and no particular tax, then the power of attorney\nmay be accepted as including representation for the specified period or periods\nfor all taxes. If a power of attorney does not designate any specific tax or\nperiod, then the power of attorney may be accepted as including representation\nfor all taxes and all periods. (e) A power of attorney should include the\ndate of execution and must be signed by the taxpayer or by an individual who is\nauthorized to execute the power of attorney on behalf of the taxpayer. The\ndivision may require the taxpayer, such individual or the representative to\nsubmit appropriate identification or evidence of authority to execute the power\nof attorney. (f) A power of\nattorney must be filed and received in the Division of Taxation in the manner\nprescribed by the commissioner. The power of attorney should be filed with the\ndivision in a conspicuous manner. Accordingly, a power of attorney should not\nbe attached to, or incorporated in, any return, report or other document that\nis routinely filed with the division unless the return, report or other\ndocument specifically provides for such attachment or incorporation. (g) Where there is doubt about the validity\nof a power of attorney or about the ability or right of the appointed\nrepresentative to act for the taxpayer, the division may refuse to accept the\npower of attorney. (See, for example, section\n3006[c] of the Tax\n\nLaw.)\n(h) The Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance may modify or waive any of the requirements of this\nsection for good cause and may prescribe special limited powers of attorney as\nmay be necessary for the proper administration of the Tax Law, related statutes\nand regulations adopted thereunder.
