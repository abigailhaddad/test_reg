  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1727-2.8 - Occupancy standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Apartment assignments must conform to the following occupancy chart provided\nsuch assignment does not violate Federal, State, and local building, health, safety and fair housing laws: Household size\nfor admission\n\nApartment size\n(minimum-maximum)\n\nStudio\n1-2\n1 Bedroom\n1-2\n2 Bedroom\n2-4\n3 Bedroom\n4-6\n4 Bedroom\n5-8\n5 Bedroom\n7-10\n\nIt is the housing company's responsibility to verify\nhousehold composition. For both new admission and transfer applications, the\nmembers of the applicant's household must be residing together and must meet\nthe applicable household size requirements at the time of application and at\nthe time of apartment availability. Nevertheless, when appropriately\ndocumented, a child subject to a joint custody agreement who lives with the\nfamily 50 percent or more of the time, or a child away at school, may be\nincluded in the household count. (b) Exceptions to the minimum household size\nin the above schedule may be permitted in the following circumstances: (1)\n\nTo encourage downsizing from\nunderutilized units, a transfer to a smaller apartment may be permitted even if\nthe household size is less than the minimum. A housing company may create a\nplan, with the division's approval, to provide additional incentives for such\ndownsizing. (2)\n\nIf no applicants on\nthe waiting list meet the occupancy standard for an apartment of a particular\nsize, despite active marketing efforts, the apartment may be offered to\napplicants eligible for the next smaller sized apartment in chronological order\nbased on application date. In such cases, it will not be counted as a refusal\nif the applicant declines the larger apartment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1727-2.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
