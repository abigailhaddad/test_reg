  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2200.14 - Receipt for rent paid\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\npayment of rent need be made unless the landlord tenders a receipt. The\nlandlord shall issue to every tenant a rent receipt at the time of each rental\npayment in the form of cash, or any instrument other than the personal check of\nthe tenant. The written receipt shall contain the date; the amount; the\nidentity of the premises and period for which paid; and the signature and title\nof the person receiving the rent. (b) A tenant may request, in writing, that a\nlandlord provide a receipt for rent paid by personal check. If such request is\nmade, the landlord shall provide the tenant with the receipt described in\nsection a of this subdivision. Such request shall, unless otherwise specified\nby the tenant, remain in effect for the duration of the tenancy. (c) The landlord shall maintain a record of\nall cash receipts for rent for at least three years unless a longer period is\nrequired by other provisions of this Title. (d) If a payment of rent is personally\ntransmitted to a landlord, the receipt for such payment shall be issued\nimmediately to a tenant. If a payment of rent is transmitted indirectly to a\nlandlord, a tenant shall be provided with a receipt within fifteen days of the\nlandlord's receipt of a rent payment. (e) If a landlord fails to receive payment\nfor rent within five days of the date specified in a lease agreement, such\nlandlord shall send the tenant, by certified mail, a written notice stating the\nfailure to receive such rent payment. The failure of the landlord, to provide a\ntenant with a written notice of the non-payment of rent may be used as an\naffirmative defense by such tenant in an eviction proceeding based on the\nnon-payment of rent.
