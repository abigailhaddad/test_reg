(7)\n\nAffected persons include: the persons or\nentities whose service is being reviewed; the State Health Planning and\n\nDevelopment Agency having jurisdiction; the health systems agency for the\nhealth service area in which the service is offered; health systems agencies\nserving contiguous health service areas; other hospitals and certified home\nhealth agencies within the health service area; any agency which establishes\nrates for hospitals or certified home health agencies; and members of the\npublic who regularly use the service being reviewed. (8)\n\nState Health Plan means the plan required\nto be developed by the State Health Planning and Development Agency and the\n\nStatewide Health Coordinating Council pursuant to the provisions of the\n\nNational Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, Public Law\n93-641, as amended. (b) The services subject to review are defined as follows: (1)\n(i) Burn care services is that care provided to burn patients in a facility having\nthe capability, equipment and personnel to provide those highly skilled\ntreatment measures required by such victims. Three degrees of severity of burn\ninjury are identified to define the level of treatment: (a) Major burn injury is at least a second\ndegree burn requiring hospitalization of the patient whose chances of survival\nare less than 95 percent or whose injury frequently results in disability. A 95\npercent chance of survival can generally be described as a second degree burn\nof greater than 25 percent total body surface area (TBSA) in persons between\nthe ages of 15 and 35 years, and greater than 20 percent TBSA in children\nyounger than 15 years and adults between 35 and 60 years of age, and all burns\ninvolving poor-risk patients, that is anyone older than 60 years and anyone\nwith a positive history of chronic and severe illness. Also included in this\ncategory are all third degree burns of 10 percent TBSA or greater, all burns\nsignificantly involving the hands, face, eyes, ears, feet or perineum, all\ncircumferential burns, all serious inhalation injuries, and all electrical\nburns and complicated burn injuries involving fractures or other major\ntrauma. (b) Moderate uncomplicated\nburn injury is a burn injury requiring hospitalization and generally described\nas a second degree burn of less than 25 percent TBSA but more than 15 percent\nin persons between the ages of 15 and 35 years, and between 10 percent and 20\npercent in children younger than 15 years and in adults between 35 and 60 years\nof age, and a third degree burn of less than 10 TBSA but more than 2 percent. Excluded from this category are all poor-risk patients, that is, anyone older\nthan 60 years and anyone with a positive history of chronic and severe illness, all burns significantly involving the eyes, ears, face, hands, feet or\nperineum, all circumferential burns, all serious inhalation injuries, and all\nelectrical burns and complicated burn injuries involving fractures or other\nmajor trauma. (c) Minor burn injury\nis a second degree burn of less than 15 percent TBSA in persons between the\nages of 15 and 35, and less than 10 percent TBSA in children younger than 15\nyears and in adults between 35 and 60 years of age, and a third degree burn of\nless than two percent. Excluded from this category are all poor-risk patients, that is, anyone older than 60 years and anyone with a positive history of\nchronic and severe illness, all burns significantly involving the eyes, ears, face, hands, feet or perineum, all circumferential burns, all serious\ninhalation injuries, and all electrical burns and complicated burn injuries\ninvolving fractures or other major trauma. (ii)\n\nBurn care takes place in the following\ntreatment settings: (a) Burn unit/center--a\nfacility with a discrete intensive care unit, dedicated beds, highly skilled\nstaff and equipment and which treats major burn victims. (b) Burn program--a facility with the trained\npersonnel and equipment to provide complete care of moderate uncomplicated burn\ninjuries including rehabilitation. (c) Hospital emergency room--a facility\ntreating minor burn injuries and providing emergency care for moderate and\nmajor burn injuries until appropriate referral transfer can take\nplace. (2)\n[Reserved]\n(3)\n(i) End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a stage\nof renal impairment that appears irreversible or permanent and requires a\nregular course of dialysis or transplantation to maintain life. (ii)\n\nDialysis is a process by which dissolved\nsubstances are removed from a patient's body by diffusion from one fluid\ncompartment to another. The two types of dialysis in common use are: (a) hemodialysis, which is a process\nutilizing an artificial kidney to remove fluids and metabolic end products from\nthe bloodstream; and\n(b) peritoneal\ndialysis, which is a process utilizing a natural semi-permeable membrane\nsurrounding the peritoneal cavity to remove toxic metabolic waste products from\nthe patient's bloodstream. This process takes place within the patient's\nbody. (iii)\n\nTransplantation is a process by which (a) a kidney is excised from a live or\ncadaveric donor, (b) that kidney is implanted in an ESRD patient, and (c)\nsupportive care is furnished to the living donor and to the recipient following\nimplantation. (iv)\n\nAcute short-term\ndialysis is dialysis required by some persons on a short- term emergency basis\nas a result of a disease or accident. (v) End stage renal disease can be treated in\nsuch settings as specified in section\n757.1\nof this\n\nSubchapter. (vi)\n\nSelf-dialysis is\ndialysis performed with little or no professional assistance by an ESRD patient\nwho has completed an appropriate course of training. (vii)\n\nHome dialysis training is a program\nthat trains ESRD patients to perform self- dialysis or home dialysis with\nlittle or no professional assistance, and trains other individuals to assist\npatients in performing self-dialysis or home dialysis. (viii)\n\nNeed and utilization of the service\nwill be determined using the following factors: (a) certified capacity, which is the number\nof stations approved to accommodate chronic renal dialysis patients per patient\nshift; (b) station, which is the\ncombination of the chair, the water and electrical supply and the machine for\ntreatment of the chronic renal patient; and\n(c) a patient shift, which is the length of\ntime required to dialyze one patient, usually 4-5 hours. (4)\n(i) Computed tomography is a technique where\na sharply collimated X-ray beam is passed from the gantry through the body from\na source which rotates around the body in a specific arc. As the beam passes\nthrough the body from its perimeter, its intensity is reduced. The transmitted\nintensity of the beam varies in accordance with the density of the tissue it\npasses through and is measured by sensitive detectors and, from this\ninformation, cross- sectional pictures or other images may be generated. A\ncomputer is used to generate the image from the measurements of X-ray beam\nintensity. Tissue images can be done with or without contrast agents. Computed\ntomography services are rendered by computed tomography (C.T.)\nscanners. (ii)\n\nComputed tomography\nscanner is an imaging machine which combines the information generated by a\nscanning X-ray source and detector system with a computer to reconstruct an\nimage of the full body, including the head. (iii)\n\nScan or a patient procedure includes\nthe initial image plus any additional images relating to the same area of\ndiagnostic interest occurring during a single visit. (iv)\nA host facility for the purposes of this\n\nPart is a hospital which is certified to provide computed tomography services\nand houses a computer tomography scanner. A host facility provides services to\nmembers of a computed tomography scanner consortium and/or other institutions\nnot certified for computed tomography services. (v) Computed tomography scanner consortium\nfor purposes of this Part is a formal referral network of hospitals, all of\nwhich are certified to provide computed tomography scanning services which are\nprovided by a host facility. (5)\n[Reserved]\n(6)\n(i) Comprehensive physical medicine and rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is the\nprocess of providing, in a coordinated manner, those comprehensive services\ndeemed appropriate to the needs of a person with a disability, in a program\ndesignated to achieve objectives of improved health, welfare, and realization\nof one's maximum physical, social, psychological, and vocational potential for\nuseful and productive activity. (ii)\nA comprehensive inpatient physical\nmedicine and rehabilitation program is a distinct organizational unit within a\ngeneral hospital, a rehabilitation hospital, residential health care facility\nwhich provides coordinated and integrated services that include evaluation and\ntreatment, and emphasizes education and training of those served. The program\nis applicable to those individuals who require an intensity of services which\nincludes, as a minimum, physician coverage 24 hours per day, seven days per\nweek, with daily (at least five days per week) medical supervision, complete\nmedical support services including consultation, 24-hour-per-day nursing, and\ndaily (at least five days per week) multidisciplinary rehabilitation\nprogramming for a minimum of three hours per day. (a) A spinal cord injury program provides\ncoordinated and integrated services for spinal cord injured persons, whether\nfrom trauma or disease, within a designated area (beds) within a facility\nproviding a comprehensive physical medicine and rehabilitation program, enabling those served to achieve optimal functions. A spinal cord injury\nprogram is consistent with the standards for a comprehensive inpatient physical\nmedicine and rehabilitation program. (b) A brain injury program is an intensive\nrehabilitation program designed to prevent and/or minimize chronic disabilities\nwhile restoring the individual to the optimal level of physical, cognitive, and\nbehavioral functioning. Persons served are generally not in a chronic\nvegetative state and the population of the unit consists primarily of those\nwith traumatically acquired, nondegenerative, structural brain damage resulting\nin residual deficits and disability. Inclusion of other cerebral disorders\nshould be based upon age, disability profiles, and service needs. The program\nis not intended to function as a stroke rehabilitation program, although some\npersons with a cerebral vascular accident may be served. A brain injury program\nis consistent with the standards for a comprehensive inpatient physical\nmedicine and rehabilitation program. (iii)\n\nOutpatient physical medicine and\nrehabilitation is a program of coordinated and integrated evaluation and/or\ntreatment services with emphasis on education and training of those served. It\nis applicable to those individuals with disabling impairments requiring an\nintensity of services including, as a minimum: medical supervision, medical\nsupport services and consultation, patient education, and appropriate allied\ntherapies. (7)\n(i) Emergency departments and emergency\nservices. Emergency departments and emergency services consist of staff, facilities and resources to evaluate, initially manage, treat or transfer\npatients to another facility that can provide definitive treatment. (ii)\n\nAn emergency visit is any unscheduled\nvisit to the emergency facility. Emergency care begins in the prehospital setting, continues in the emergency facility, and concludes when the responsibility for\nthe patient is transferred to another physician or the patient is discharged. The care of the patient during the continuum of emergency care is under the\ndirection of the emergency physician who is responsible for the timely\nevaluation, treatment and transfer of the patient.
