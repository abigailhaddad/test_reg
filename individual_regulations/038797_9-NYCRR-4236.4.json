No trainer shall start or permit a\nhorse in his custody, care or control to be started if he knows, or he might\nhave known or have cause to believe, that the horse has received any drug or\nother restricted substance that could result in a positive test. The trainer\nshall be held responsible for any positive test unless he can show by\nsubstantial evidence that neither he nor any employee nor agent was responsible\nfor the administration of the drug or other restricted substance. Every trainer\nmust guard each horse trained by him in such manner and for such period of time\nprior to racing the horse so as to prevent any person whether or not employed\nby or connected with the owner or trainer from administering any drug or other\nrestricted substance to such horse contrary to this Part.
