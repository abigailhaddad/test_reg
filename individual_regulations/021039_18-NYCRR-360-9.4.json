  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-9.4 - Eligibility for the CHCEP services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The CHCEP is available to a family which: is ineligible for MA and PA; meets the residency requirements of section\n369-c\nof\nthe Social Services Law; and has eligible catastrophic health care\nexpenses. (b) (1)\n\nThe CHCEP assistance with cost sharing of\neligible catastrophic health care expenses is available to a family if its\nhealth care expenses, after deducting health insurance benefits, are in excess\nof 50 percent, but are no more than 75 percent, of the difference between the\nadjusted or projected annual family income and the maximum PA grant it would\nreceive if it were eligible for PA. (2)\n\nFor a family which is eligible for the\nCHCEP assistance with cost sharing under paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the\nCHCEP will pay a percentage of the expenses for covered services and the family\nmust pay the remainder. The Commissioner of Health has established a schedule\nsetting forth the cost-sharing percentages which will be used to allocate costs\nbetween families and the CHCEP for the various CHCEP services (10 NYCRR\n85.42\n). The CHCEP share of the expenses will be determined by multiplying the cost\nsharing percentage by the MA rate for the service or the rate charged by the\nprovider of the service, whichever is less. (3)\nA family in receipt of the CHCEP\nassistance with cost sharing may be reimbursed only for paid bills for health\ncare services incurred during the previous calendar year, unless the family\ndemonstrates hardship as defined in section\n360-9.3\nof this Subpart. If\nhardship is demonstrated, the family in receipt of the CHCEP may be reimbursed\nup to the MA rate for the current year's expenses. When the social services\ndistrict determines that hardship exists, payments may be made directly to the\nprovider of the health care services. The social services district may\ndetermine that hardship exists at the time a family applies for an interim\nauthorization or assistance with or without cost sharing under this\n\nSubpart. (c) (1)\n\nThe CHCEP assistance without cost sharing\nof eligible catastrophic health care expenses is available to a family if its\nhealth care expenses, after deducting health insurance benefits and the\nbenefits available pursuant to section\n360-9.4\n(b) of\nthis Subpart, are in excess of 75 percent of the difference between the\nadjusted or projected annual family income and the maximum PA grant it would\nreceive if it were eligible for PA. (2)\n\nFor a family which is eligible for the\nCHCEP assistance without cost sharing under paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the CHCEP will reimburse a family for the bills it has paid for covered\nservices and directly pay the provider of service for unpaid bills. The CHCEP\nwill reimburse or pay for such bills at the MA rate for the service or the rate\ncharged by the provider of the service, whichever is less. (d) A family may apply to the social services\ndistrict for an interim authorization which would enable the family, on a\nprospective basis, to have any medical expenses covered under the MA program\nreduced to the MA rate or fee. To be eligible for an interim authorization, a\nfamily must be eligible for the CHCEP pursuant to subdivision (b) or (c) of\nthis section. The social services district must use projected income and\nallowable deductions to compute the current year's adjusted income for purposes\nof determining eligibility for interim authorization. The interim authorization\nmay not extend beyond the final day of the calendar year in which the services\nwere rendered and in which eligibility for the CHCEP assistance was\nbased. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§§\n360-9.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
