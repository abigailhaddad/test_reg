  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 526.6 - Retail sale\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1101(b)(4)\n(a) The term\nretail sale\nor\nsale at retail\nmeans the sale of tangible personal property to any person for any purpose, except as specifically excluded. (b) Special rule-sales specifically included as retail sales. (1)\nA sale of any tangible personal property to a contractor, subcontractor or repairman for use or consumption in erecting structures or buildings or adding to, altering, improving, maintaining, servicing or repairing real property, property or land, is deemed to be a retail sale, regardless of whether the tangible personal property is to be resold as such before it is used or consumed. (See Part 541 of this Chapter.)\n(2)\nA sale of tangible personal property designed for use in some manner relating to domestic animals or poultry, when sold to a licensed veterinarian, is deemed a retail sale, notwithstanding a subsequent sale of such item of tangible personal property by said veterinarian. (See Part 528 of this Subchapter.)\n(3)\nA sale of tangible personal property to a mortician, undertaker or funeral director for use in conducting funerals is deemed a retail sale to him, notwithstanding a subsequent sale of such items. (See Part 528 of this Subchapter.)\n(4)\nA sale of automotive fuel by a distributor is deemed a retail sale by him notwithstanding a subsequent sale of such fuels. (See Part 560 of this Subchapter.)\n(c) Resale exclusion. (1)\n\nWhere a person, in the course of his business operations, purchases tangible personal property or services which he intends to sell, either in the form in which purchased, or as a component part of other property or services, the property or services which he has purchased will be considered as purchased for resale, and therefore not subject to tax until he has transferred the property to his customer. Cross-references: Special applications of resale exclusions, see the following sections of this Title: utility services, 527.2; storage, 527.6; food and drink, 527.8; hotel occupancy, 527.9; cups, plates and beverage containers used in or by restaurants, 528.20(d). (2)\nA sale for resale will be recognized only if the vendor receives a properly completed resale certificate. See section\n532.4\nof this Title. (3)\n\nReceipts from the sale of property purchased under a resale certificate are not subject to tax at the time of purchase by the person who will resell the property. The receipts are subject to tax at the time of the retail sale. Example 1: A store purchases shirts from a wholesaler to sell to its customers. The store does not pay its wholesaler a tax on its purchase of the shirts but collects the tax from its retail customers. (4)\n(i) Tangible personal property which is purchased and given away without charge, for promotion or advertising purposes is not purchased for resale. It is a retail sale to the purchaser thereof, and is not a sale to the recipient of the property. (ii)\n\nTangible personal property which is purchased for promotional or advertising purposes and sold for a minimal charge which does not reflect its true cost, or which is not ordinarily sold by that person in the operation of his business, is a retail sale to the purchaser thereof, and not a sale to the recipient of the property. (iii)\nA resale certificate may not be used by the person making the purchases described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph for such purchases. Example 2: A bank has purchased premiums which will be given to depositors upon the opening of an account in a new branch. As the bank is not in the business of selling such items, and as it in fact does not sell such items to its customers, the sale to the bank of such items of tangible personal property is a retail sale which is taxable at the time of purchase. The bank has not purchased these items for resale. Example 3: A vendor purchases catalogs and distributes them to his potential customers for a minimal charge, which does not reflect the cost to him. He is the retail purchaser of the catalog, and is required to pay the tax thereon. He cannot charge his customer tax on the charge for the catalog. (5)\n\nThe purchase by a vendor of an item of tangible personal property which is sold by him as a physical component part of tangible personal property to a customer is a purchase for resale and therefore is not subject to tax. Items of tangible personal property other than machinery or equipment, which are used in manufacturing tangible personal property for sale, but do not become a physical component part of the property manufactured are not purchased for resale, but may be eligible for an exemption from state and local taxes. See Part 528 of this Title. Example 4: A book publisher purchases leather for making book bindings and then sells the books directly to the public. The leather has become a physical component part of the books sold to the public and therefore has been purchased for resale by the book publisher and is not subject to the tax. Example 5: A company engaged in the printing of designs on unfinished fabrics for garment manufacturers purchases processing paper and detergents to be used in the manufacturing process. The fabric is rolled in processing paper and put through a pressure steaming operation where dyes are developed and are fixed into the fabrics. After the fixation process, the fabric is unrolled from the processing paper and washed with detergents. The washing process (during which a small portion of the detergent stays with the fabric) removes the dirt from the previous handling of the fabric, washes out surplus dyes and changes the texture of the fabric. As a portion of the detergent stays with the fabric, the detergent qualifies as a component part of a product for sale and the company may purchase the detergent exempt from the New York State and local sales tax. The processing paper is considered a supply used in connection with exempt machinery and may be purchased exempt from the New York State and local sales tax, except the taxes imposed within New York City by section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. (6)\n\nTangible personal property purchased for use in performing services which are taxable under section\n1105 (c)(1) (2) (3) and (5)\nof the Tax Law is purchased for resale and not subject to tax at the time of purchase, where the property so sold (i) becomes a physical component part of the property upon which the services are performed, or (ii) is later actually transferred to the purchaser of the service in conjunction with the performance of the service subject to tax. Example 6: A watch repairman purchases a new stem and places it in a watch that he is repairing for a customer. The purchase of the stem by the watch repairman is a purchase for resale not subject to tax at the time of its purchase as it will become a physical component part of property upon which services were performed. Example 7: A service station purchases grease to be used for lubricating automobiles, without payment of tax as the grease will be transferred to the customers in connection with the performance of a taxable service. Example 8: The publisher of a stock market information service, which is not personal and individual in nature, may purchase the paper on which the service is printed for resale. The paper is actually transferred to his customers in conjunction with the performance of a service subject to tax. Example 9: A painter purchases plastic drop cloths and sandpaper and after painting a customer's premises, leaves the used drop cloths and sandpaper at the premises. The drop cloths and sandpaper, even though limited or no use after the painting, have not been purchased for resale as they are items used by the painter in performing a taxable service. The drop cloths and sandpaper are not actually transferred to the purchaser of the service in conjunction with the performance of the service. (7)\n\nTangible personal property purchased for use in performing a service not subject to tax is not purchased for resale. Example 10: A shoe repairman purchases leather to be used for resoling shoes. His purchase of the leather is not a purchase for resale, even though the leather will be transferred to the customer in connection with the performance of the service because the service he is performing is not taxable. Example 11: A dentist purchases gold to be used as fillings and crowns. The purchase by the dentist is not for resale, even though the gold is transferred to his patient, in the performance of his service. (8)\n\nThe resale exclusion also applies to a sale of service. Example 12: A jeweler sends a customer's watch to a repairman for servicing. The charge by the jeweler to the customer is taxable. The charge to the jeweler by the repairman is not taxable because the service was purchased for resale by the jeweler. (d) Exclusions relating to corporate and partnership transactions. (1)\n\nThe following transfers of property are not retail sales: (i) The transfer of property to a corporation, solely in consideration for the issuance of its stock, pursuant to a merger or consolidation effected under the law of New York or any other jurisdiction. (ii)\n\nThe distribution of property by a corporation to its stockholders as a liquidating dividend. (iii)\n\nThe distribution of property by a partnership to its partners in whole or partial liquidation. (iv)\n\nThe transfer of property to a corporation upon its organization in consideration for the issuance of its stock. (v) The contribution of property to a partnership in consideration for a partnership interest therein. The transfers described in this paragraph between partners and partnerships, and between corporations and stockholders, are excluded from the definition of \"retail sale\" because while the form of ownership of the property is changed, there is a continuity of interest in the property transferred. Cross-reference: See Part 537 of this Title. (2)\n\nContributions to partnerships. (i) A partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business for profit. Limited partnerships and joint ventures are included as partnerships. (ii)\nA partner's contribution is the property valued in money or the monetary amount he contributes to the firm for commencing or carrying on the business whether at the commencement of business or later. Contributions of property are not subject to sales or use tax. Example 1: A, B and C agree to deal in raw wool as partners. Each transfers $20,000 worth of tangible personal property to the partnership. These transfers are contributions which are not retail sales. Later C transfers other tangible personal property to the firm for cash. This is a taxable sale and not a contribution in consideration for a partnership interest. Example 2: D owns a pleasure boat. He sells E a one-half interest in the boat. The sale is a retail sale. Co-ownership without the carrying on of a business is not a partnership. (3)\n\nPartnership liquidations. The liquidation of a partnership is the return, complete or partial, of partnership capital to the partners. In a liquidation a partner's interest is diminished by the value of the property distributed to him. The distribution of tangible personal property pursuant to a liquidation is not a taxable sale. Example 3: F, G and H are partners operating two stores. The partnership owns five station wagons. The partnership closes one store, and distributes one station wagon to each partner. The distribution of these station wagons constitutes a partial liquidation. (4)\n\nOther partnership transactions. (i) The purchase or surrender of a partnership interest for cash, or the substitution of one partner for another, is the sale of intangible personal property and is not subject to sales tax. (ii)\n\nThe purchase by a partner of tangible personal property from the firm is a retail sale. (5)\n\nTransfers of property to a corporation upon its organization. (i) The transfer of property to a corporation upon its organization, in consideration for issuance of its stock, is not a retail sale. (ii)\n\nCorporate existence is deemed to begin upon the filing of the certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State. Only transfers made at the time of the commencement of the corporate business, or within a reasonable time thereafter, while the corporation is still in the process of organizing its business, are eligible for the exclusion. (iii)\n\nTransfers made to a dormant corporation, which is being activated, are not eligible for the exclusion. Example 4: A corporation filed a certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State on February 1, 1974. On March 10, 1976 it is decided that the corporation is to be activated, and on March 15, 1976 a stockholder transfers tangible personal property - a truck - to the corporation, in consideration of the issuance of shares of stock. The transfer is not excluded from the definition of retail sale, as it was not made upon the organization of the corporation. (iv)\n\nWhere a transfer of property is made to a corporation upon its organization in consideration of the issuance of stock, and other property, the transfer is a sale to the extent of the other consideration. Example 5: A contribution of tangible personal property is made to a corporation upon its organization in consideration of the issuance of $3,000 in shares of stock and $7,000 in notes. The transfer is a retail sale to the extent of $7,000. (v) Where a transfer of property is made to a corporation upon its organization in consideration of the issuance of stock, and the assumption of debts and liabilities representing security interests in the property transferred, the transfer is eligible for exclusion from the definition of retail sale. (6)\n\nMergers and consolidations. (i) A merger under the law of New York is the procedure whereby two or more corporations merge into a single corporation which is one of the participating corporations. (ii)\nA consolidation under the law of New York is the procedure whereby two or more corporations consolidate into a single corporation which is a newly organized corporation. (iii)\nA merger or consolidation under the law of any other jurisdiction is one that qualifies under section\n368(a)(1)(A)\nof the Internal Revenue Code or which meets the requirements of the law of the Sate, District of Columbia or territory pursuant to which it was effected. Example 6: Corporation A is merged into Corporation B. Example 7: Corporation A and B are consolidated into Corporation C. Example 8: Corporation A owns all the stock of Corporation B. Corporation B is merged into Corporation A pursuant to the Business Corporation Law. Included among the property transferred is machinery, office equipment and supplies. The transfer of the tangible personal property to Corporation A, pursuant to the merger, is not subject to sales tax. (iv)\n\nWhere a corporation purchases another corporation's assets in consideration of issuance of stock of the purchasing corporation, or the parent of the purchasing corporation, such as under section\n368(a)(1)(C)\nof the Internal Revenue Code, the transaction does not qualify as a merger or consolidation, even if the selling corporation is subsequently liquidated. Example 9: Corporation A will transfer its assets to Corporation B in consideration for B's issuance of shares of its stock. Corporation A will continue to exist for discharging its expenses, and then will be dissolved. The transfer of tangible personal property will be subject to tax, as it is carried out under a plan of reorganization but is not a statutory merger or consolidation. (v) Where a transaction is taxable the tax base is computed by applying the percentage that the value of tangible personal property in New York bears to the value of all the assets transferred to the total consideration, including value of stock and liabilities assumed. (7)\n\nIssuance of stock by a corporation acquiring property. (i) The stock issued in consideration for the transfer of tangible personal property to a corporation pursuant to a merger or consolidation, or upon its organization, must be the stock of the corporation receiving the property. A transaction in which the stock issued is that of a parent corporation does not qualify for exclusion. Example 10: Corporation A organizes Corporation B as a subsidiary. Upon the organization of Corporation B, Corporation C transfers certain tangible personal property to Corporation B in exchange for stock of Corporation A. This transfer is not excluded from the definition of retail sale, as the stock issued upon the organization of B was that of Corporation A, its parent. (ii)\n\nTo the extent that securities other than its stock are issued by a corporation for transfer of tangible personal property to it pursuant to a merger or consolidation, or upon its organization, the transaction does not qualify for exclusion. (8)\n\nOther inter-corporate transactions. (i) The sale of property by one related corporation to another related corporation is a retail sale, and taxable to the extent of the consideration paid, or the fair market value, if the consideration paid is not an adequate indication of the true value of the property transferred. Example 11: On February 1, 1976, Corporation A transfers to its subsidiary, Corporation B, ten 1975 trucks, for a total of $40,000. The fair market value of the trucks is $100,000. Corporation A has made a taxable retail sale to Corporation B in the amount of $100,000. (ii)\n\nThe transfer of property to a corporation, as a contribution to capital, at a time other than its organization, without the issuance of stock or other consideration, is not a retail sale. (9)\n\nCorporate liquidations. (i) The distribution of tangible personal property by a corporation to its stockholders as a liquidating dividend is not a retail sale. (ii)\n\nThe liquidating dividend may be as a result of a partial or complete liquidation. (iii)\n\nThe liquidating dividend must be declared in accordance with the law of the state of incorporation, to qualify for exclusion from the definition of retail sale.
