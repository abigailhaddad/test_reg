Tit. 9 § 3.110 - Executive order no. 110: establishing the state commission to commemorate the centennial of franklin delano roosevelt\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe year 1982 will mark the hundredth anniversary of the\nbirth of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 44th Governor of the State of New York\nand the 32nd President of the United States. The people of the Empire State can take great pride in the\nlife and achievements of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Born in Hyde Park on\n\nJanuary 30, 1882, he began his political career in 1910 in the New York State\n\nSenate. He was one of New York's major contributions to the administration of\n\nWoodrow Wilson, serving as an Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the First\n\nWorld War. Though crippled by an attack of polio in 1921, he nevertheless\nreturned to public affairs and in 1928 was elected to the first of two terms as\n\nGovernor of the State of New York. In 1933 he went on to Washington to become\nthe first and only man elected four times president of the Republic. As President, he led the nation during its two worst crises\nof the Twentieth Century--the Great Depression and the Second World War. Coming\ninto office with the economy in collapse, he told the people that they had\nnothing to fear but fear itself and, with that great spirit, he organized a\nlegislative program that permanently transformed American life. The New Deal\nreforms--social security and unemployment compensation; farm price supports; conservation and development of natural resources; Federal guarantees of\ncollective bargaining; regulation of the stock exchanges; insurance of bank\ndeposits; and so much more--reflected his abiding quest for the humanization of\nindustrial society, and for economic security within a frame of political\nfreedom. As the United States struggled out of the depression under\nhis bold and imaginative leadership, the world outside entered a period of\nturbulence and danger. From an early point, President Roosevelt understood the\nmenace of fascism in Europe and imperialism in Japan. His Good Neighbor Policy\npromoted the unity of the Western Hemisphere, and, though impeded by rigid\nneutrality legislation, he strove perseveringly to awaken the country to the\nthreat of international aggression. When Pearl Harbor was attacked and war\nbroke upon American shores, his eloquence, courage and determination released\nthe energies of American production and inspired the sacrifices of America's\narmed forces. Death came to President Roosevelt on April 12, 1945. He was\nremoved from the stage of life on the brink of total victory. The Four Freedoms\nand United Nations remain as the legacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's lifelong\nsearch for world peace and justice. All Americans--and New Yorkers especially--remember him for\nhis personal example of triumph over physical adversity; for his unfailing\nbuoyancy, cheer and hope; for the force and intimacy of his fireside chats; for\nhis concern for the poor, the unemployed, the minorities, and the third of a\nnation that was ill-housed, ill-clothed, ill-fed; for his conviction that\ngovernment could be made an instrument of the general welfare; and for his\ninvincible confidence in the American future and in the future of\nhumanity. A controversial figure in his time, he is recalled today by\nmen and women of all parties as a great and exhilarating leader who renewed\npopular faith in the efficacy of democratic government and in the vitality of\nour nation's best ideals. All New Yorkers will wish to join in the commemoration of\nthis most renowned New Yorker. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby establish a State Commission to Commemorate\nthe Centennial of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and do hereby proclaim 1982 as the\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Year in the State of New York.
