  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 664.1 - Computation of depreciation rates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Depreciation percentage rates shall be computed in conformity with a group plan\nof accounting for depreciation and shall be such that the loss in service value\nof the property, except for losses excluded under the definition of\ndepreciation, may be distributed under the straight-line method during the\nservice life of the property. These percentage rates shall be based upon the\nestimated service values and service lives developed by a study of the\ncompany's history and experience and such engineering and other information as\nmay be available with respective future conditions. Such percentage rates shall\nnot include any allowance for loss in service value of property expected to be\ninstalled in the future. The percentage rates shall, for each primary account\ncomprised of more than one class of property, produce a charge to operating\nexpenses for that account equal to the sum of the amounts that would otherwise\nbe chargeable for each of the various classes of property included in the\naccount. (b) In the event any\ncomposite percentage rate becomes no longer applicable, revised composite\npercentage rates shall be computed and filed with the Commission in accordance\nwith subdivisions (a) and (d) of this section. (c) The company shall keep such records of\nproperty and property retirements as will allow the determination of the\nservice life of property which has been retired, or facilitate the\ndetermination of service life indications by mortality, turnover, or other\nappropriate methods. Such records will also allow the determination of the\npercentage of salvage value or net salvage value, as appropriate, for property\nretired from each class of depreciable plant. (See account 2321 regarding\namortization of customer premises wiring.)\n(d) Not later than six months following the\ndate when a company becomes subject to this system of accounts, it shall have\nfiled with this commission estimates of the composite annual percentage rates\nconsidered applicable to the original cost of each class of depreciable\ntelecommunications plant owned or used by the company. (Note section\n664.2\nof this Part.) The estimates\nof the composite annual percentage rates so filed shall be accompanied by a\nstatement subscribed to by an officer or other duly authorized representative\nof the company, showing the bases therefor and the methods employed in their\ncomputation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n664.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
