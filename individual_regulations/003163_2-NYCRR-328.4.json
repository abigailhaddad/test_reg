  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 328.4 - Return to public service\n\nState Regulations\n\nUpon termination of an approved leave of absence without pay, the employee member must return to the public service from which he or she was\ngranted the leave. Credit will not be given for service or final average salary\npurposes unless the employee member actually returns to the payroll of such\npublic employer and actually engages in the performance of his or her official\nduties. A return to the payroll of the State or a participating employer for\nthe sole purpose of exhausting vacation, sick leave or other similar benefits, will not qualify the employee member for such credits. A failure to return to\nthe service of the State or a participating employer upon termination of an\napproved leave of absence, as provided herein, will result in the revocation of\nthe contingent approval previously granted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n328.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
