  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.7 - Components of double composite liner system\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Primary and secondary composite liners. (1)\n\nPrimary composite liner. The primary\ncomposite liner must be constructed using a GCL with a hydraulic conductivity\nof 1x10\n-8\ncentimeters per second or less\nand which is constructed with bentonite demonstrating chemical and physical\nstability. The GCL must be placed below and in direct and uniform contact with\nthe primary geomembrane liner. The carrier geotextile of the GCL must be a\nmaterial that will inhibit the migration of bentonite into the secondary\nleachate collection and removal system. (2)\n\nSecondary composite liner. The secondary\ncomposite liner must be constructed using a minimum two-foot-thick soil liner\nplaced below and in direct and uniform contact with the secondary geomembrane\nliner. The soil component of the secondary composite liner must: (i) be free from stones greater than one inch\nin diameter and stones having an angular surface; (ii)\nbe a total of at least 24 inches in\ncompacted thickness; (iii)\nhave a\nremolded hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10\n-7\ncentimeters per second or less throughout its thickness; (iv)\nbe constructed and maintained to\nminimize the presence of cracks and granular material as long as it is exposed, as specified in a department-approved CQA/CQC plan; and\n(v) be overlain by and in direct and uniform\ncontact with a geomembrane. (b) Construction requirements. The project\nengineer must ensure that the installation of the soil and/or GCL components of\nthe liner system conforms to the following minimum requirements: (1)\nGCL components. (i) All GCLs must be placed in accordance\nwith requirements specified in paragraphs 363-6.8(b)(2) through (4) of this\n\nSubpart and without damaging any component of the secondary leachate collection\nand removal system. The GCL must be placed at a slope of no less than two\npercent except for along the leachate collection pipes which must have slopes\nof no less than one percent. The GCL must be placed at a slope of no greater\nthan 33 percent in any direction. (ii)\nGCL field seams must be primarily\noriented parallel to the line of maximum slope (i.e., oriented along, not\nacross the slope). (iii)\n\nAll GCL\nfield seams must be made using bentonite and a minimum 12-inch overlap, and\nmust be made in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications as approved\nby the design engineer. (iv)\n\nThe\nGCL must not be installed during a precipitation event. Installed GCLs must be\ncovered by the approved geomembrane by the end of the day they are installed\nand must be loaded with at least one foot of soil within 60 days of\ninstallation. Any GCL that becomes hydrated after it is installed and before it\nis covered with an approved geomembrane must be removed, unless the project\nengineer determines, and certifies in construction certification report, that\nthe degree of hydration will allow the overlying geomembrane and soil material\nto be placed without affecting the performance of the installed GCL and that\nits properties are compliant with the approved specifications. (v) All rolls of GCL materials received and\nstored at the landfill must be enclosed in protective wrapping such as the\noriginal, unopened packaging or an opaque, waterproof tarpaulin to ensure\nprotection from direct sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, precipitation, flames\nor welding sparks, temperatures in excess of 160° F and below 32° F, mud, debris and other deleterious materials, and any other environmental\ncondition that may damage the physical property values of the material. All\nrolls must be stored off of the ground on a surface that is free of sharp\nobjects. The storage location must be stable, dry, and well-drained. Rolls of\nGCL materials must not be stored in stacks more than three tiers high. Extended\noutdoor storage of rolls must not exceed manufacturer's recommendations or nine\nmonths, whichever is less. For storage periods longer than manufacturer's\nrecommendations or nine months, GCL rolls must be placed in a well ventilated, enclosed structure. The temperature of the enclosed structure must not exceed\n95° F. (2)\n\nSoil\nliner components\n(i) The soil component of\nthe liner system must be placed at a slope of no less than two percent in\ndirections perpendicular to leachate collection pipes, and no less than one\npercent in directions parallel to the leachate collection pipes. The soil\ncomponent of the liner system must be placed at a slope of no greater than 33\npercent in any direction. (ii)\n\nDuring compaction, proper control of the moisture content, lift thickness, compactive energy/kneading action, placement operations and other details\nnecessary to effectively destroy soil clods, eliminate lift interfaces and\navoid mixing with subgrade soils must be maintained. The final compacted\nthickness of each lift must not exceed eight inches. Placement of the first\nlift of the soil component of the liner system must prevent mixing of the soil\nliner system materials and subgrade. (iii)\n\nThe moisture content and compacted\ndensity of the soil component of the liner system must be maintained at all\ntimes within the range identified in the moisture-density-permeability relation\ndeveloped in accordance with subparagraph 363-6.7(c)(2)(v) of this section to\nensure that the remolded lift hydraulic conductivity is less than or equal to 1\nx 10\n-7\ncentimeters per second. (c) Certification requirements. (1)\n\nFor GCLs, the project engineer must\ncertify that: (i) all GCL sheets used in liner\nsystem construction have been inspected by the manufacturer and at the job site\nfor needles and sheet defects; and\n(ii)\nall construction meets the requirements\nof paragraph 363-6.7(b)(1). (2)\n\nFor soil barrier components, the project\nengineer must certify the quality control testing of any soil liner materials, document that the specified material meets the approved engineering drawings, engineering report, CQA and CQC plan, and project specifications. The hydraulic\nconductivity requirement for the soil liner material must be less than or equal\nto 1 x 10\n-7\ncentimeters per second. Before and\nduring construction of the soil component of the liner system, the results of\nthe following testing at a minimum must be reviewed and accepted by the project\nengineer prior to placement: (i) one analysis\nof soil particle size for every 2,500 cubic yards of material placed; (ii)\none Atterberg limits analysis of plastic\nand liquid limits and plasticity index for every 1,000 cubic yards of material\nplaced; (iii)\none laboratory\npermeability test using a triaxial cell with back pressure for every 5,000\ncubic yards of material placed; (iv)\none moisture content test for every\n1,000 cubic yards of material placed; and\n(v) a minimum of one comparison of the\nmoisture-density-permeability relation for every 5,000 cubic yards of material\nplaced. (3)\n\nQuality\nassurance testing of soil components required under this paragraph must be\ncompared to and evaluated against the quality control testing of paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision where applicable. (i) Quality assurance testing locations must be evenly distributed across the side\nslopes and bottom area of the landfill and must include density and moisture\ncontent tests to be performed at a minimum of nine locations per acre per lift\nof soil material placed. (ii)\n\nFor\neach location, the density and moisture content must be compared to the\nappropriate moisture-density-permeability relation to determine the\npermeability at that location. (iii)\n\nOne shelby tube sample for laboratory\npermeability testing must be taken per acre per lift. (iv)\n\nAny tests resulting in penetration of\nthe soil liner must be repaired using bentonite or other means or material\nacceptable to the department. (4)\n\nThe certification report must address all\nmeasures taken to remedy GCL or soil liner damage that occurred during and\nafter construction and any measures taken to prevent damage. Notes\nN.Y.
