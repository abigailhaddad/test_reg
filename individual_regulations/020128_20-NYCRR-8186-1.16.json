  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-1.16 - Full value measurements for market value surveys with valuation dates on or after January 1, 2001, generally\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section applies to full value\nmeasurements for market value surveys with valuation dates on or after January\n1, 2001. These full value measurements will be used to establish State\nequalization rates, class equalization rates and class ratios pursuant to this\n\nPart for cities, towns, village homestead assessing units, village school\nassessing units, county assessing units, coordinated assessment programs and\nconsolidated assessing units. Prior to the establishment of any tentative\nequalization product pursuant to this section, ORPTS shall publish procedures\nfor the market value survey or surveys used in calculating those products and\nfor the calculation of those products. In establishing such procedures for each\nmarket value survey and for the calculation of yearly equalization products, ORPTS shall specify which of the provisions below are applicable. (b) Identification of approach for full value\nmeasurement. (1)\n\nWhen an assessing unit\nimplements a reassessment within the period prescribed in the procedures for\nthe particular market value survey, for the purpose of determining State\nequalization rates, class equalization rates, and class equalization ratios, the full value is determined as provided in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nFor all other\nassessing units, full value is determined as provided in subdivision (d) or (e)\nof this section. (c) Full value measurement of assessing units which implement reassessments. (1)\n\nWhen only one reassessment is implemented\nduring the period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the roll on\nwhich the reassessment is implemented shall be the roll used to measure full\nvalue for purposes of this section. (2)\n\nWhen an assessing unit implements more\nthan one reassessment within the period identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this\nsection, the roll used for the purposes of this section shall be either: (i) the roll containing a reassessment\nimplemented in the year of the valuation date of the full value measurement; otherwise\n(ii)\nthe most recent\ncompleted roll implementing a reassessment. (3)\n\nThe aggregate full value estimates are\ndetermined from assessment rolls implementing reassessments as provided in\nsection\n8186-2.15\nof this Part. (4)\n\nIf the valuation\ndate of a reassessment is different from the valuation date of a market value\nsurvey, adjustments to the aggregate full value estimate will be as provided in\nsection\n8186-2.16\nof this Part. These adjustments will reflect changes in market conditions\noccurring between the valuation date of the reassessment and the valuation date\nof the market value survey. (d) Full value measurement for assessing\nunits which do not implement reassessments. The full value of assessing units\nwhich do not implement reassessments is determined as provided in section\n8186-2.17\nof this Part. (e) Alternative full\nvalue measurement for assessing units which do not implement reassessments. The\nprocedures for a market value survey may provide for alternative methods for\nmeasuring the full value of some or all of the classes of real property in an\nassessing unit that has not implemented a reassessment in the time period\nprescribed in the procedures for that survey. These alternatives may include, but are not limited to, an analysis of local assessments to determine the\npercentage at which parcels in some or all classes are assessed and use of that\npercentage in measuring the full value of the appropriate class; use of a\ncomputer assisted mass appraisal approach to calculate the full value of some\nor all classes in an assessing unit; and use of appropriate valuation data as\nprovided in the procedures for that survey. (f) Adjustment for changes in quantity of\nproperty between assessment rolls. When the reassessment roll, or the measured\nroll, is different from the current roll, adjustments to the full value\nestimate may be made. These adjustments shall reflect the changes in the\nquantity of property between the revaluation or update roll, or measured roll, and the current assessment roll. (g) Isolated properties. (1)\n\nCertain properties shall be isolated from\nthe full value estimates as provided in the procedures for the particular\nmarket value survey. (2)\n\nThe full\nvalue of such properties will reflect the quantity of property existing on\ntaxable status date of the current assessment roll, and shall be valued as of\nthe valuation date of the full value measurement. (h) Determination of the full value of\nassessing units for equalization rate purposes. (1)\n\nThe full value of an assessing unit is\ncomputed by adding: (i) the full value of\nproperty included in the estimates from subdivision (c), (d) or (e) of this\nsection, after any adjustments made pursuant to subdivision (f) of this\nsection; and\n(ii)\nthe full value of\nany isolated properties. (i) Computation of the tentative State\nequalization rate. (1)\n\nThe total assessed\nvalue of the assessing unit is computed by adding: (i) the total assessed value of roll sections\n1 and 6 on the current assessment roll; and\n(ii)\nthe final State land assessments\napproved for the current assessment roll. (2)\n\nThe total assessed value computed in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision is divided by the total full value computed\nin subdivision (h) of this section. The result is multiplied by 100 and rounded\nas provided in the procedures for calculating the appropriate equalization\nrates, and is established as the tentative State equalization rate.
