  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 412.4 - Preliminary certification\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 285-a(3)\n(a) (1)\n\nIf, due to the circumstances of delivery, it is not possible to issue a complete\ncertification of tax payment in accordance with section\n412.3\nof this Part at the time of delivery, the Department of Taxation and Finance, upon application, may authorize the use of a preliminary certification. An\nexample of where such authorization may be granted is the circumstance where\nmotor fuel is sold through a terminal operated by a third person at which the\nseller has no agents or employees and the information necessary for a complete\ncertification is not available. (2)\n\nAuthorization to issue a preliminary certification must be received from the\ndepartment and an application for authorization to issue preliminary\ncertifications must contain a detailed description of the applicant's method of\noperation (including where motor fuel is stored and the method of withdrawal\nfrom storage) and an explanation of why it is not possible to issue complete\ncertifications of tax payment at the time of delivery. If the applicant is not\na registered distributor under article 12-A of the Tax Law, the application\nmust also contain a list of the applicant's suppliers and the names of the\ndistributors who will be remitting the tax to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. A seller authorized to issue preliminary certifications who is not a\nregistered distributor must notify the department of any changes in its\nsuppliers or in the names of the distributors who will be remitting the tax\nwithin five days of any such changes. Failure to do so results in revocation of\nthe authorization to issue preliminary certifications. Preliminary\ncertifications may be issued only under those circumstances and for those\nlocations for which authorization is expressly granted by the\ndepartment. (b) The\nauthorization to issue preliminary certifications is subject to review and may\nbe revoked at any time by the Department of Taxation and Finance. In addition, the authorization of a registered distributor to issue preliminary\ncertifications is immediately and automatically revoked upon cancellation of\nthe distributor's registration. In order to continue to issue certifications in\nsuch instance, the person must submit a new application as a\nnondistributor. (c) A preliminary\ncertification must be signed by the seller or its authorized representative. If\nthe seller is a motor fuel distributor registered pursuant to article 12-A of\nthe Tax Law, no signature is required. The preliminary certification may be\nfurnished by either of two methods: (1)\n\nThe\nseller may provide its customer with the following statement prior to delivery\nof motor fuel covering any and all deliveries for which a preliminary\ncertification is authorized during a particular month: (Seller) certifies that both the New York State motor\nfuel tax and prepaid sales tax required to be paid on any fuel sold to\n(purchaser) have been paid or have been assumed and will be paid by the seller\nor were passed through to the seller by his supplier. In addition, (seller)\ncertifies that his current authorization to issue preliminary certifications, which is herewith provided to you or has previously been provided to you, has\nnot been revoked and is currently in effect. (Seller) also certifies that the\namounts of these taxes will be stated to you within 10 business days of any\ndelivery and in a form acceptable to the New York State Department of Taxation\nand Finance. This statement must contain the names of the seller and\nthe purchaser and the month and year covered by the statement. The statement\nmust be renewed every month. (2)\n\nAlternatively, the seller may incorporate\nthe following statement in its bill of lading, loading ticket, delivery\nreceipt, or other shipping document given to the purchaser at the time of\ndelivery of the motor fuel: (Seller) certifies that both the New York State motor\nfuel tax and prepaid sales tax required to be paid for the motor fuel shown on\nthis document have been paid or have been assumed and will be paid by the\nseller or were passed through to the seller by his supplier. In addition, (seller) certifies that his current authorization to issue preliminary\ncertifications, which is herewith provided to you or has previously been\nprovided to you has not been revoked and is currently in effect. (Seller) also\ncertifies that the amounts of these taxes will be stated to the purchaser\nwithin 10 business days of this delivery and in a form acceptable to the New\n\nYork State Department of Taxation and Finance. (d) The preliminary certification, if\naccepted in good faith, will, until delivery of the complete certification or\nfor 10 business days, whichever is sooner, relieve the purchaser of liability\nfor payment of the motor fuel tax and the prepaid sales tax. In the event a\npreliminary certification is used, the seller must furnish the purchaser with a\ncomplete certification of tax payment within 10 business days of the delivery\nof the motor fuel. If the purchaser does not receive a properly completed\ncertification of tax payment within such 10 business days, it may no longer\navail itself of the protection of the preliminary certification. Accordingly, such purchaser is subject to personal liability for the payment of the motor\nfuel and prepaid sales taxes. Additionally, if a purchaser does not receive a\nproperly completed certification of tax payment from a seller within 10\nbusiness days, it may not thereafter avail itself of the protection of any\npreliminary certifications issued by such seller. (e) As a condition to constitute acceptance\nof a preliminary certification in good faith from a seller, the purchaser must\nhave received from the seller at or prior to the time of receipt of the\npreliminary certification a copy of the seller's letter of authorization to\nissue a preliminary certification from the Department of Taxation and Finance. Such authorization must be in effect at the time of the receipt of any\npreliminary certification. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
