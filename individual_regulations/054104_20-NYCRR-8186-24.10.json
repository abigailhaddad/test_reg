Tit. 20 §§ 8186-24.10 - Supplemental sample\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The initial\nresults of the sample estimate are analyzed in accordance with the following\nprocedures. If the coefficient of variation is larger than a predetermined\nvalue, a supplemental sample is required. For purposes of this section, initial results\nshall mean the determinations of a coefficient\nof variation and supplemental sample as computed from the original survey data, regardless of the first use of the survey data, except that data changes\nsubsequent to the original determinations that are incorporated into the survey\ndata prior to, but not at the same time as, completion of the supplemental\nsample have the following effect: (1)\n\nIf the\nmunicipality, borough of New York City, Amityville or Wyandanch School District\nin the Town of Babylon, school district in a school district segment survey\nassessing unit, class in a special assessing unit or homestead assessing unit, school district designated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law in a homestead assessing\nunit or a special assessing unit or class in a portion in a special assessing\nunit or homestead assessing unit: (i) previously did not require a supplemental sample and the recomputed coefficient\nof variation does not exceed the survey limit, no additional samples are\nrequired; (ii)\npreviously did not\nrequire a supplemental sample and the recomputed coefficient of variation\nexceeds the survey limit, additional samples are required; (iii)\npreviously required a supplemental\nsample and the recomputed coefficient of variation exceeds the survey limit, new additional samples are required; or\n(iv)\npreviously required a supplemental\nsample and the recomputed coefficient of variation does not exceed the survey\nlimit, no additional samples are required. (2)\n\nData changes occurring in an assessing\nunit in a county where a supplemental sample was required, subsequent to the\ncompletion of the supplemental sample, or in an assessing unit in a county\nwhere no supplemental sample was required, more than two months after the\ndetermination of the coefficient of variation and supplemental sample, will not\naffect the determinations of a coefficient of variation and supplemental\nsample. (b) The following\noperations shall be performed in the determination of the supplemental sample: (1)\n\nCompute the coefficient of variation for\neach municipality, borough of New York City, Amityville or Wyandanch School\n\nDistrict in the Town of Babylon, school district in a school district segment\nsurvey assessing unit, class in a special assessing unit or homestead assessing\nunit, school district designated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law in a homestead assessing\nunit or special assessing unit, and class in a portion in a special assessing\nunit or homestead assessing unit. (i) During\nthe computation of the market value ratio estimate pursuant to this Subpart, the contribution to the coefficient of variation of the estimate, or CV, is\nalso estimated for each value interval. (ii)\n\nFor the computation of the coefficient\nof variation for a class in a special assessing unit, each \"U\" interval is\nassumed to have a relative sampling variance proportional to its corresponding\nspecial assessing unit class relative variance. For the computation of the\ncoefficient of variation for a class in a nonspecial assessing unit or the\n\nAmityville or Wyandanch School District in the Town of Babylon, each \"U\"\ninterval is assumed to have a relative sampling variance proportional to its\ncorresponding municipal or school district relative variance. (iii)\nA coefficient of variation is not\ncomputed for the utility class. \"S\" intervals for the utility class are assumed\nto make no contribution to the sampling error since the intervals are not\nassigned their sample parcels by random selection methods. (iv)\n\"T\" intervals make no contribution to\nthe sampling error. (v) All other\n\"S\" intervals contribute to the sampling error. (vi)\n\nThe estimated coefficient of variation\nfor each estimate is obtained by expressing the estimated standard error as a\npercentage of the ratio estimate. (2)\n\nDetermine the number of supplemental\nsample parcels necessary with respect to each municipality, borough of New York\n\nCity, Amityville or Wyandanch School District in the Town of Babylon, school\ndistrict in a school district segment survey assessing unit, class in a special\nassessing unit or homestead assessing unit, school district designated in\nformer 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law in a homestead assessing\nunit or special assessing unit, and class in a portion in a special assessing\nunit or homestead assessing unit. (i) If\nnecessary, a supplemental sample is determined and the estimated coefficients\nof variation are tested in a multistep process. The order of the steps is as\nfollows: (a) New York City: (1)\nmunicipal level estimate; (2)\nborough level estimate; and\n(3)\nspecial assessing unit class level\nestimates. (b) Nassau\n\nCounty: (1)\ncity and town level\nestimate; (2)\nschool district\ndesignated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law level\nestimate; (3)\nspecial assessing\nunit class level estimate; (4)\ncity\nand town class level estimate; (5)\nvillage or town outside village class level estimate; and\n(6)\nschool district class level\nestimate. (c) School\ndistrict segment survey assessing units: (1)\nmunicipal level estimate; and\n(2)\nschool district portion level estimate. (d) Homestead assessing units: (1)\nhomestead assessing unit level\nestimate; (2)\nhomestead assessing\nunit class level estimate; (3)\nschool district portion designated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law; and\n(4)\nportion class level estimate. (e) For the Amityville or\n\nWyandanch School District in the Town of Babylon, the school district level\nestimate. (f) For all other\nmunicipalities, the municipal level estimate. (ii)\n\nAfter the first step, the testing of the\nmunicipal estimated coefficient of variation, any hypothetical reduction to the\nCV attributed to any supplemental sample required in the first step or\nsubsequent steps is assumed to have actually occurred prior to the test for the\nnext step. (iii)\n\nAt each step, the\nestimated coefficient of variation is compared to its corresponding CV limit\nshown herein. (iv)\n\nIf the CV is\ngreater than the appropriate CV limit, the sample size of the \"S\" interval\ncontributing most to the CV is increased by one, the value interval\ncontribution and CV are reduced hypothetically in accordance with sampling\ntheory, and the adjusted CV is further tested against the CV limit. This\nprocess continues until a minimum number of supplemental samples have been\nassigned or the adjusted CV no longer exceeds the appropriate CV limit. If the\ninitial CV estimate does not exceed the appropriate CV limit, no supplemental\nsample is assigned for the step. The minimum supplemental sample assigned for\nthe municipal level estimate step is six, and for the village, borough, Amityville and Wyandanch School Districts in the Town of Babylon, school\ndistrict in a school district segment survey assessing unit, and school\ndistrict designated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law in a special or\nhomestead assessing unit level estimate steps the minimum supplemental sample\nassigned is four. There are no minimums for the other estimates\ntested. (v) The CV limits for New\n\nYork City are: CV\nlimit\n\nMunicipal-citywide\n2%\nBorough\n3%\n(vi)\n\nFor a class at the special assessing\nunit level, the CV limit is five percent. (vii)\n\nThe CV limits for other assessing units\nare: (a) Municipal, the Amityville and\n\nWyandanch School Districts in the town of Babylon, a school district segment\nsurvey assessing unit or a school district designated in former 9 NYCRR section\n186-6.1, as repealed in 1998 and\nset forth in section\n1230\nof the Real Property Tax Law in a homestead assessing\nunit or special assessing unit.
