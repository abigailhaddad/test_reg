  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.112 - Executive order no. 112: establishing the employee assistance program task force\n\nState Regulations\n\nAlcoholism, drug addiction and other similar problems exact\ntremendous economic, as well as human, costs. Among the most promising\napproaches to the treatment of these problems has been the development by the\nbusiness and labor communities of employee assistance programs. A typical\nemployee assistance program provides access to counseling and treatment, on a\nconfidential basis, to employees who are identified as having personal problems\naffecting their job performance. With the aid of this early intervention, counseling and treatment, many of these persons can be helped. There is growing evidence that employee assistance programs\nare both successful and cost-effective. Studies indicate that, in the case of\nalcoholism, employees referred to treatment have achieved high recovery rates. Furthermore, an employer receives a substantial return for the investment in an\nemployee assistance program as a result of cost savings from decreased\nabsenteeism, fewer accidents and lower utilization of health care\nbenefits. Notwithstanding the success of employee assistance\nprograms, only 12 percent of the total work force in New York State currently\nhave access to employee assistance programs. Several pilot projects, established by the State of New York in conjunction with public employee\nunions, have demonstrated the need for the development of a comprehensive\nemployee assistance program supported by the State and public employee unions\nfor all State employees. NOW, THEREFORE, I, HUGH L. CAREY, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby establish a task force, to be known as the\n\nEmployee Assistance Program Task Force, to assist me in the development of a\ncomprehensive labor-management supported employee assistance program for all\n\nState workers. I. Powers and\n\nResponsibilities. A. The Employee Assistance\n\nProgram Task Force shall: make recommendations concerning the nature and scope of the\n\nState's employee assistance program; identify potential funding sources; recommend appropriate organizational structure and staff\nrequirements; and draft an employee assistance program policy statement. B. The Task Force shall submit to\nthe Governor a report of its findings and recommendations no later than\n\nFebruary 1, 1982. II. Membership. The Task Force will be chaired by the Director of the\n\nDivision of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse and consist of the Director of the\n\nOffice of Employee Relations and Director of the Division of the Budget. The\n\nGovernor shall also appoint to the Task Force commissioners and directors of\nother appropriate State departments offering employee assistance programs, the\npresidents of public service employee unions, and experts in the field. Members of the Task Force shall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred in\nconnection with the performance of their duties. III. Personnel. In performing its powers, duties and functions, the Task\n\nForce shall utilize the resources of the Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol\n\nAbuse, the Department of Civil Service and any State department providing an\nemployee assistance program.
