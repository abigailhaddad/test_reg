  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 598-2.4 - Reporting, investigation, and confirmation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reporting responsibilities. (1)\n\nThe reporting requirements of this\nsection apply to the following persons: (i) the facility owner; (ii)\nthe tank\nsystem owner; (iii)\nthe\noperator; (iv)\nthe\ncarrier; (v) any contractor in a\ncontractual relationship with the facility owner, tank system owner, or\noperator; (vi)\nany other party and\nits contractors who have been retained as part of a business transaction\nrelating to the facility; and\n(vii)\nany person who causes a spill at the facility. (2)\n\nAny person required to report under\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision must report the spill in accordance with\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, employees of an owner or operator may report\nspills pursuant to a facility-specific centralized reporting protocol, provided\nthat such reporting protocol is in writing and has been incorporated into the\nfacility's spill prevention report prepared pursuant to section 1.9 of this\n\nPart. Independent consultants and contractors are not considered to be\nemployees of the facility for the purposes of this section. (b) Prohibition of spills. The spilling of a\nhazardous substance is prohibited unless: (1)\nsuch spill is authorized; (2)\nsuch\nspill is continuous and stable in quantity and rate and has been reported\npursuant to paragraph 597.4(b)(4) of this Title; or\n(3)\nsuch spill is of fire-fighting foam\ncontaining Perfluorooctanoic Acid (CAS No. 335-67-1), Ammonium\n\nPerfluorooctanoate (CAS No. 3825-26-1), Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid (CAS No. 1763-23-1), or Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (CAS No. 2795-39-3) used for fighting\nfires (but not for training purposes) and occurs on or before April 25, 2017. In the event there is a spill of such foam that exceeds the reportable quantity\nof any hazardous substance, the spill must be reported pursuant to subdivision\n(f) of this section. (c) Reporting of suspected spills. (1)\n\nSuspected\nspills must be reported to the department's Spill Hotline (800-457-7362) within\n2 hours after discovery and the procedures in subdivision (e) of this section\nmust be followed for any of the following conditions: (i) the discovery of hazardous substance\noutside of a UST system at the facility or in the surrounding area (e.g., the\npresence of free product or vapors in soils, basements, sewer and utility\nlines, and nearby surface water); (ii)\nunusual operating conditions observed\n(e.g., the erratic behavior of hazardous substance dispensing equipment, the\nsudden loss of hazardous substance from the UST system, an unexplained presence\nof water in the tank, or water in the interstitial space of secondarily\ncontained tank system components), unless the tank system component is found to\nbe defective but not leaking, and is immediately repaired or\nreplaced; (iii)\nmonitoring/testing\nresults, including alarms, from a leak detection method required under\nsubdivisions\n2.3\n(a) and (b)\nof\nthis Subpart which indicate that a leak may have occurred, unless: ('a')\nthe monitoring device is found to be\ndefective, and is immediately repaired, recalibrated, or replaced, and\nadditional monitoring does not confirm the initial result; or\n('b')\nthe alarm was investigated and\ndetermined to be a non-spill event (e.g., from a power surge or caused by\nfilling the tank during leak detection testing); (iv)\ntesting/monitoring results from periodic\ntesting/monitoring required under paragraph 2.2(d)(1) of this Subpart, for a\nfill port catch basin, containment sump, or any other containment equipment, indicate that the containment equipment has no integrity. (v) any other conditions or indications of a\nsuspected spill. (2)\n\nWhere a spill of any hazardous substance has occurred or is suspected, the\ndepartment may order the owner to inspect any tank system, location, and/or\nassociated equipment which might be the source of the actual or suspected spill\nand to test for tightness and structural soundness. If the owner fails to\nconduct such tests within 10 days of the order, the department may do so. The\nreasonable expenses of conducting such tests incurred by the department shall\nbe paid by the owner. (d) Investigation due to off-site impacts. When required by the department, the\nprocedures in subdivision (e) of this section must be followed to determine if\nthe UST system is the source of off-site impacts. These impacts include the\ndiscovery of a hazardous substance(s) (e.g., the presence of free product or\nvapors in soils, basements, sewer and utility lines, and nearby surface and\ndrinking waters) that has been observed by the department or brought to its\nattention by another party. (e) Leak investigation and confirmation steps. Unless corrective action is\ninitiated in accordance with Subpart 6 of this Part, any leak or suspected leak\nof a hazardous substance(s) must be immediately investigated using either one\nof the methods described in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subdivision or\nanother procedure approved by the department. The investigation must be\ncompleted, and the results submitted to the department, prior to any repairs\nand within 7 days after the reporting required under subdivision (c) or (f) of\nthis section. Upon review of this information, the department may require the\ncollection, evaluation and submission of additional information and preparation\nof a response and corrective action plan. (1)\n\nSystem test. Testing must be conducted in accordance with paragraph 2.2(d)(1), 2.3(c)(1), or 2.3(d)(2) of this Subpart to determine whether a leak exists in\nthe portion of the UST system (including delivery piping) suspected of leaking\nand, in the case of hazardous substance reaching secondary containment, whether\na breach of the secondary containment occurred. (i) If the test results indicate that a leak\nor release has occurred, the leaking UST system must be immediately emptied to\nprevent further leaks and be: ('a')\npromptly\ntaken out of service in accordance with subdivision 2.6(a) of this Subpart and\nrepaired in accordance with subdivision\n2.2\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart; ('b')\nreplaced; or\n('c')\npermanently closed in\naccordance with subdivision 2.6(b) of this Subpart. (ii)\n\nIf the test results indicate that a\nrelease has occurred, corrective action must also begin in accordance with\n\nSubpart 6 of this Part. (iii)\n\nIf\nthe test results do not indicate that a leak exists but environmental\ncontamination is the basis for suspecting a leak, a site check must be\nconducted in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nIf the test results do not indicate that\na leak exists and environmental contamination is not the basis for suspecting a\nleak, further investigation is not required. (2)\n\nSite check. The presence or absence of a\nrelease must be determined where contamination is most likely to be present at\nthe facility (i.e., in the excavation zone or at the UST system location). In\nselecting sample types, sample locations, and measurement methods, the\nfollowing must also be considered: nature of the hazardous substance(s)\npreviously stored in the UST system; type of initial alarm or cause for\nsuspicion; type of backfill; depth of groundwater; and other factors\nappropriate for identifying the presence and source(s) of the release. (i) If the site check results indicate that a\nrelease has occurred, corrective action must begin in accordance with Subpart 6\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nIf the site\ncheck results do not indicate that a release has occurred, further\ninvestigation is not required. (f) Response to spills. (1)\n\nWith the exception of spills described in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, the following spills of a hazardous\nsubstance, that is covered under clauses 597.1(b)(7)(i)('a') and ('b') of this\n\nTitle, must be reported to the department's Spill Hotline (800-457-7362) within\ntwo hours after discovery by any person in actual or constructive control or\npossession of the hazardous substance when it is spilled, or any employee, agent, or representative of such person who has knowledge of the spill: (i) the spill of a reportable quantity that\noccurs within any twenty-four hour period; (ii)\nthe spill of a quantity that is less\nthan a reportable quantity if any of the following conditions exist: ('a')\nsuch spill results, or may reasonably\nbe expected to result, in a fire; ('b')\nsuch spill results, or may reasonably\nbe expected to result, in an explosion; ('c')\nsuch spill results, or may reasonably\nbe expected to result, in the violation of air quality standards; ('d')\nsuch spill results, or may reasonably\nbe expected to result, in vapors, dust and/or gases that may cause illness or\ninjury to persons, not including persons in a building where a release\noriginates; or\n('e')\nrunoff from\nfire control or dilution waters may reasonably be expected to result in or\ncontribute to a violation of water quality\nstandards. (2)\nA spill of a hazardous substance mixture is subject to the following reporting\nrequirements: (i) If the quantity of the\nhazardous constituents of the hazardous substance mixture is known, notification is required where a reportable quantity or more of any hazardous\nconstituent is released. (ii)\n\nIf\nthe quantity of the hazardous constituent(s) of the hazardous substance mixture\nis unknown, reporting is required where the total amount of the mixture\nreleased equals or exceeds the reportable quantity for the hazardous\nconstituent with the lowest reportable quantity. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, it is not necessary to report a spill of a\nreportable quantity of a hazardous substance if all of the following conditions\nare met: (i) there is control over the spill\nand it is completely contained; (ii)\nthe spill has not and will not reach the\nland or waters of the State; (iii)\nthe spill is cleaned up within two hours after discovery; (iv)\nthe total volume of the spill is\nrecovered or accounted for; and\n(v) the spill will not result in any of the conditions listed in subparagraph\n(1)(ii) of this subdivision. (g) Emergency response. (1)\n\nIn addition to the requirements of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, the owner or operator must take immediate\naction upon discovery of a spill to protect human health, safety, and the\nenvironment. Immediate actions which may be necessary include signaling alarms, mitigation of fire and safety hazards, contacting emergency response officials, evacuation of personnel from the site, isolation of the impact zone, preventing\nthe migration of the spill and stopping, plugging or containing the spill. Corrective action as specified in 6.2 of this Part must also be undertaken to\nclean up and remove the spilled material and restore the site to protect public\nhealth, safety, and the environment. (2)\n\nLeaking tank systems must be immediately\nemptied to prevent further leaks and be: (i) promptly taken out of service in accordance with subdivision 2.6(a) of this\n\nSubpart and repaired in accordance with subdivision\n2.2\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart; (ii)\nreplaced; or\n(iii)\npermanently closed in\naccordance with subdivision 2.6(b) of this\n\nSubpart.
