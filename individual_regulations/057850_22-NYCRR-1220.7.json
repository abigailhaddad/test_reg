  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1220.7 - Appendix\n\nState Regulations\nATTORNEY-CLIENT MEDIATION PROGRAM\nGUIDELINES FOR ATTORNEYS, CLIENTS AND MEDIATORS\n1. INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAM\nIt is the responsibility of the Appellate Divisions of\nthe Supreme Court to ensure that attorneys are fit to practice law and adhere\nto proper ethical standards through the disciplinary programs administered by\nthe Grievance Committee or the Office of Chief Counsel (\"disciplinary office\")\nin each judicial department. When clients assert that an attorney's conduct\njeopardizes the public interest or severely prejudices a client's rights, such\nmisconduct is subject to formal disciplinary procedures. These procedures can\nresult in private sanctions, public censure, suspension or disbarment. When\nclients assert grievances that may not warrant formal disciplinary procedures, such grievances may be appropriate for referral by the disciplinary office to\nthe Program for Mediation of Attorney-Client Disputes that has been established\nby the Appellate Divisions at 22 NYCRR Part\n1220\n(April 1998). 2. THE MEDIATION PROCESS\nMediation is a proven means of dispute resolution which\nenables parties to meet together in an informal atmosphere with the assistance\nof a neutral mediator in order to find solutions that address their interests\nand needs. Mediation can provide attorneys, clients and the disciplinary office\nwith an effective means of resolving minor disputes in a non-adversarial\nmanner. Mediation provides an opportunity to address a client's underlying\ninterests and needs, while minimizing costs for attorneys in defending minor\ncomplaints and encouraging a positive relationship between attorneys and their\nclients and the disciplinary office. 3. COMPLAINTS SUBJECT TO MEDIATION\nThe disciplinary office will evaluate a client's\ncomplaint about an attorney's conduct to determine whether it is appropriate\nfor mediation. Referral to mediation is entirely within the discretion of the\ndisciplinary office and neither the complainant nor the attorney has any\npresumptive right to have a complaint referred to mediation. However, once the\ndisciplinary office deems a complaint appropriate for mediation, and the\nparties agree to mediate, each party shall cooperate in the mediation process. The types of cases that will be referred to mediation generally are those in\nwhich there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and where\nthe complaint could be resolved best through conciliation and not formal\ndisciplinary proceedings. 4. COMPLAINTS EXCLUDED FROM MEDIATION\n(a) Misconduct in the Complaint. Since avoidance of ethical\nmisconduct by attorneys is a matter of public interest to the State and the\ncourts, a complaint will not be considered appropriate for referral to\nmediation when it asserts ethical misconduct that could be subject to private\nsanctions, public censure, suspension or disbarment, including, but not limited\nto: (1)\nescrow violations; (2)\nallegations of criminal\nconduct; (3)\na pattern of similar\nmisconduct or behavior (existing over a reasonable period of time); (4)\nallegations of abuse of alcohol or drugs\nor of physical or mental impairment. (b) Misconduct Revealed During\n\nMediation. When an attorney engages in material ethical misconduct at\nthe mediation session or a party to the mediation reveals that the attorney has\nengaged in material ethical misconduct that was not previously known by the\ndisciplinary office, whether that conduct is related to or unrelated to the\ncomplaint being mediated, the mediator shall terminate the mediation process\nand report the misconduct to the disciplinary office in the mediation summary\nreport. Such report shall be accompanied by the complaint and response\noriginally submitted to the mediator. A copy of the mediation summary report\nwill also be provided to the mediation coordinator for inclusion in the\nmediation file. The mediation report constitutes an exception to the\nconfidentiality of all phases of the mediation process. 5. MEDIATOR PANELS\n(a) Mediators. Mediators\nshall consist of attorneys appointed by the court or by the bar associations\nwho have agreed to serve as volunteer mediators and who meet the experience and\ntraining requirements deemed appropriate by the Court. (b) Mediation Coordinators. Bar associations may appoint one of their members to serve as a mediation\ncoordinator (\"coordinator\") to assist the disciplinary office in administering\nthe program, including maintaining files, scheduling mediation, assessing\nconflicts of interest between a potential mediator and the parties to the\nmediation before appointing the mediators, and appointing mediators on a\nrotating basis from the lists of available mediators. In counties within a\njudicial department where there are fewer than 200 registered attorneys, local\nbar associations may designate a regional coordinator to represent the\ninterests of the respective bar associations in administering the\nprogram. (c) Mediator\n\nTraining. Mediator Training Programs may include the following: (1)\nconflict resolution, negotiation, and\nmediation theory; (2)\nstandard\nmediation process and techniques, including mediation skills that relate to\nactive listening, eliciting interests that may not seem legally relevant, probing, reframing of concerns, and introducing ordinary standards of\nprofessional practice to those unfamiliar with them; (3)\nstandards for conduct of mediators\nconcerning impartiality, ethics and confidentiality; (4)\nstatutes, rules and practices governing\nmediated settlement conferences; and\n(5)\nidentification of cases that are not\nappropriate for mediation. (d) Mediator Immunity. The\nmediator will not be liable for any act or omission while serving as an\napproved volunteer mediator except for wilful misconduct. Attorneys serving as\nvolunteer mediators in this program are entitled to the protections afforded to\n\nState-sponsored volunteers within the meaning of subdivision (l) of section\n17\nof the\n\nPublic Officers Law. (e) Conflicts of Interest and Impartiality. Upon receipt of the\nfile, mediators, prior to the start of mediation or as part of the assignment\nprocess by the coordinator, shall determine whether there exists any conflict\nof interest between the mediator and the parties to the mediation. Conflicts\ninclude, but are not limited to, a personal or business relationship by the\nmediator with one of the parties during the last five years; an adversarial\nrelationship between the mediator or an attorney in his or her firm and either\nparty within the last five years; or legal representation of one of the parties\nby the mediator or by an attorney in his or her firm that concluded within the\nlast five years. Where such a conflict of interest exists and is not waived by\nthe parties, the matter shall be assigned to another mediator. In addition, if\nat the start of the mediation process either party objects for cause to the\nassigned mediator, or the mediator does not believe that he or she can serve as\nan impartial mediator, a new mediator should be appointed. The mediator will conduct the conference informally. At\nthe outset of the process, the mediator should describe the rules by which the\nmediation will proceed and make clear to the parties that he or she is serving\nas a mediator and not a judge. The mediator's role is to facilitate communication and\nsuggest ways of resolving the dispute, and not to impose a settlement on the\nparties. The mediator shall make every effort to hear all the relevant facts, review all the relevant documents, become familiar with any controlling legal\nprinciples and seek to bring about an acceptable compromise between the\nparties. The mediator should refrain from using legal jargon and assure that\nany proposal discussed as a means of resolving the matter is clearly understood\nby the parties. 6. MEDIATION PROCESS\nThe disciplinary office, upon determining that a\ncomplaint is appropriate for mediation, will send copies of the complaint and\nany other correspondence related to the complaint, to the appropriate mediator\nor coordinator, and notify the attorney and the complainant of the referral. The mediator or coordinator then will notify the attorney by first class mail\nto submit within 20 days a response to the complaint, if a response was not\npreviously submitted. If no response is received within 20 days, the complaint\nwill be returned to the disciplinary office for investigation. Upon receipt of the attorney's response, the matter will\nbe assigned to or retained by an impartial mediator. The mediator will schedule\na mediation conference within 14-21 days after assignment of the matter, or if\nthe matter has been directly handled by the mediator, within 14-21 days after\nreceipt of the response. Any additional correspondence from the attorney or the\ncomplainant concerning the dispute must be submitted to the mediator no later\nthan 10 days prior to the mediation conference. The mediator may grant an\nadjournment of the conference for good cause, but in no event may the\nconference be held more than 45 days after the response has been received or\nafter referral to the coordinator, whichever is later. Within 10 days following the conclusion of the mediation, the mediator shall send a mediation summary report to the disciplinary\noffice. 7. LIMITED\nCONFIDENTIALITY FOR ATTORNEY-CLIENT MEDIATION PROCESSES\nThe significant public interest involved in regulating an\nattorney's fitness to practice law requires that mediation shall be\nconfidential except as stated below and except as required by section\n90\n(10)\nof the Judiciary Law. Mediators shall\ninform the parties to the mediation about these exceptions in the mediator's\nopening statement in the mediation session. (a) Mediators Shall Report\n\nMisconduct. Mediators shall report to the disciplinary office whenever\nan attorney engages in material ethical misconduct during a mediation session\nor when a party to the mediation reveals that the attorney engaged in material\nethical misconduct that was not previously known by the disciplinary office, whether such conduct is related to or unrelated to the complaint being\nmediated. Mediators shall terminate the mediation process and report the\nmisconduct to the disciplinary office in the mediation summary report. Such\nreport shall be accompanied by the complaint and response originally submitted\nto the mediator. A copy of the report shall be provided to the coordinator for\ninclusion in the mediation file. The conduct reported by the mediator under\nthis section along with the allegations of the original complaint are subject\nto investigation by the disciplinary office. (b) Mediated Agreements Shall be\n\nForwarded to Disciplinary Offices. Upon the termination of mediation, the mediator shall include a duplicate original of any full or partial signed\nagreement reached by the parties at the mediation session with the mediation\nsummary report that must be filed with the coordinator or the disciplinary\noffice. Coordinators will forward the agreement and report to the disciplinary\noffice. (c) Report Shall be\n\nFiled upon Unsuccessful Mediation. The coordinator or mediator shall\nreport a termination of the mediation process to the disciplinary office on a\nmediation summary report when a complainant fails to respond to a notice or to\nappear, when the complainant withdraws the complaint, or when the mediator\nterminates the mediation on his or her own accord if agreement cannot be\nreached. (d) Correspondence\n\nShall be Labeled \"Confidential.\"\nAll correspondence by disciplinary\noffices, coordinators or mediators to the parties shall bear the legend, \"PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL.\"\n(e) Files Shall be Confidential with Exceptions. Except as\nprovided in (f) below, documents submitted to the mediator shall be used only\nfor the mediation process and shall be returned to the party who provided them\nat the close of the mediation process, including brief statements that the\nmediator requests from the parties before the start of mediation process after\nthe response to the complaint is filed. The complaint and response to the\ncomplaint along with any mediated agreement will remain part of the mediation\nfile. The files created for the mediation program, including administrative\ndocuments created by the coordinator, shall be marked as \"CONFIDENTIAL\" and all\nreasonable steps shall be taken by the disciplinary office, coordinator and\nstaff, and mediators to assure such confidentiality, except as specifically\nprovided in these rules. Absent an order from the Appellate Divisions to the\ncontrary pursuant to section\n90\n(10)\nof the Judiciary Law, the only persons\nwho shall have access to the confidential files are coordinators and their\nadministrative staffs, members of the disciplinary offices, appropriate\n\nAppellate Division staff, and the complainant and attorney, or their respective\nlegal representatives. Mediators shall only have access to the files for cases\non which they serve as mediators. (f) Mediation Sessions Shall be\n\nConfidential with Exceptions. Mediation sessions shall be held in\ncircumstances assuring confidentiality of the process. Mediators should assure\nthe availability of confidential individual caucus sessions with each party to\nencourage parties to discuss their genuine interests and needs that may assist\nthe mediator in helping the parties reach acceptable mutual resolutions. Mediators have an obligation to report to the disciplinary offices any evidence\nnot previously known by the disciplinary office that raises a substantial\nquestion as to the attorney's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer\nin other respects. Mediators shall not reveal information to another party to\nthe mediation when it is identified as confidential by the revealing party. Mediators and parties agree they shall not reveal any statements, conduct or\ndocuments used during mediation to third parties, except as specifically\nrequired by these rules. 8. OUTCOME OF THE MEDIATION PROCESS\n(a) Failure to Cooperate. If\nan attorney fails to respond to a complaint or to appear at a mediation\nsession, the mediator shall terminate the mediation and file a mediation\nsummary report. If a complainant fails to cooperate in the mediation process, the mediator shall terminate the mediation process and file with the\ndisciplinary office a recommendation that the complaint be dismissed. (b) Dismissal of complaint upon an\nattorney's compliance with Mediated Agreement. When a mediation\nresults in a mediated agreement, an attorney's compliance with the terms of a\nmediated agreement in a timely and good faith manner will result in dismissal\nof the complaint by the disciplinary office. Mediated agreements should set\nforth a reasonable time frame for compliance whenever feasible. (c) Failure to Comply with a Mediated\n\nAgreement. Before the close of the mediation session, the mediator\nwill inform the client that an attorney's failure to comply with the mediated\nagreement in the time period specified in the agreement will result in the\nmatter being referred to the disciplinary office. If an attorney fails to\ncomply with the terms of a mediated agreement on file with the disciplinary\noffice, the disciplinary office may initiate a disciplinary investigation on\nthe original charges and on \"conduct prejudicial to the administration of\njustice\" arising from non-compliance with the mediated agreement. If such\ninvestigation is commenced, the mediated agreement, complaint and response to\nthe complaint can be used by the disciplinary office in its\ninvestigation. (d) Failure\nto Reach Agreement. When parties do not reach agreement in the\nmediation, the mediator shall report termination of the process without\nagreement on the mediation summary report sent to the disciplinary office which\nmay continue its investigation of the original complaint.
