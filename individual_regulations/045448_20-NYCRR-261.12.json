  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 261.12 - Change other than from accrual to installment method of accounting\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 5(d)(2) of § 1340(c); Codes and Ordinances of\nthe City of Yonkers, § 92-102(d)(2)\n(a) If a nonresident taxpayer's method of\naccounting is changed, other than from an accrual to an installment method, there must be taken into account, in computing net earnings for the taxable\nyear of the change, those adjustments pertaining to inventories, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, etc., which are determined to be necessary to\nprevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. If the change has occurred by\nreason of a change in such taxpayer's Federal method of accounting, such\nadjustments will generally be reflected in such taxpayer's Federal net earnings\nfrom self-employment and therefore in such taxpayer's City of Yonkers net\nearnings from self-employment for the year of the change. The year of the\nchange is the taxable year for which the taxable earnings of the taxpayer are\ncomputed under a method of accounting different from that used for the\npreceding year. (b) The adjustments\nnecessitated by reason of such change in accounting method may result in an\namount of City of Yonkers earnings tax for the year of the change in excess of\nthe City of Yonkers earnings tax which would have been determined had there not\nbeen such change in the method of accounting. In such event, the additional\n\nCity of Yonkers earnings tax shall not be greater than if such adjustments were\nratably allocated and included for the taxable year of the change and the\npreceding taxable years beginning after 1983, not in excess of two, during\nwhich the taxpayer used the method of accounting from which the change was\nmade. (c) The nonresident taxpayer\nmust submit a statement with the City of Yonkers earnings tax return for the\nyear of the change, setting forth the following information and calculations: (1)\neach adjustment necessitated by the\nchange; (2)\nthe net amount of the\nadjustments. This means the consolidation of the adjustments (whether the\namounts thereof represent increases or decreases in items of income or\ndeductions) arising with respect to balances in various accounts at the\nbeginning of the taxable year of the change. Where the change in the method of\naccounting occurs by reason of a Federal change, this net amount must be the\nsame for the City of Yonkers earnings tax purposes as it is for Federal income\ntax purposes; (3)\nthe City of\n\nYonkers earnings tax for the taxable year of the change with the net amount of\nadjustments included in the computation of City of Yonkers earnings; (4)\nthe City of Yonkers earnings tax for the\ntaxable year of the change computed as if the net amount of such adjustments\nwere not included in the computation of City of Yonkers earnings; (5)\nthe additional City of Yonkers earnings\ntax, if any, incurred solely by reason of the net amount of adjustments\nincluded in City of Yonkers net earnings, computed by subtracting paragraph (4)\nof this subdivision from paragraph (3) of this subdivision; (6)\nthe allocation of the net amount of\nadjustments (paragraph [2] of this subdivision) to the taxable year of change\nand the preceding taxable year or years, not in excess of two, during which the\ntaxpayer used the method of accounting from which the change is made. The\namount to be allocated to each such year is determined by dividing the net\namount of adjustments into as many equal parts as there are taxable years\ninvolved (either two taxable years or three taxable years, including the\ntaxable year of the change); (7)\nthe City of Yonkers net earnings for the year of the change and for the\npreceding year or two years, as the case may be, computed both (i) without any\namount of the net adjustments and (ii) with the addition of the appropriate\nshare of the net adjustments as determined under paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision; (8)\nthe additional\n\nCity of Yonkers earnings tax which would result for each of the above taxable\nyears by the addition to the City of Yonkers net earnings in each such year of\nthe appropriate share of the net adjustments; and\n(9)\nthe total amount of such additional City\nof Yonkers earnings tax for the years involved. (d) If the amount described in paragraph\n(c)(9) of this section exceeds the amount described in paragraph (c)(5) of this\nsection, the nonresident taxpayer must compute such taxpayer's City of Yonkers\nearnings tax for the year of the change without a ratable allocation of the net\nadjustments to any preceding year or years. If the amount described in\nparagraph (c)(5) exceeds the amount described in paragraph (c)(9) the amount of\nthe excess must be subtracted from the City of Yonkers earnings tax for the\nyear of the change as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The\nresult is the amount of City of Yonkers earnings tax due for the taxable year\nof the change. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
