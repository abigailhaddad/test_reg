  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 638.7 - Standards and methods for determining compliance\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section provides the standards for each feature and category of consideration for green buildings. Also, where necessary, this section further specifies methods for demonstrating compliance beyond the basic written certifications of compliance by the owner, applicant and appropriate licensed professionals described in section\n638.5\n(b) and (c)\nof this Part. (a) Appliances. (1)\n\nStandards. (i) The appliances installed in a base building or tenant space must be models with an Energy Star® label. (ii)\n\nIf the owner of a base building, or the owner's agent: (a) installs in residential units; (b) offers for installation in residential units; or\n(c) offers for purchase to tenants in residential units of that building appliances, then all such appliances must be models with an Energy Star® label. (b) Heating, cooling and service water heating equipment. (1)\n\nStandards. The performance prescribed in the energy code, in the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules, and Regulations of the State of New York (NYCRR), Title 9, Part 7813 or 7814 as applicable to the building type, must be met for all heating, cooling and service water heating equipment that belongs to the base building or tenant space. Lower performance is not permitted for the purposes of this Part even if an alternate compliance method is used to demonstrate compliance with the energy code under 9 NYCRR Part\n7812. (c) Energy use. (1)\n\nStandards. (i) Base building. For new construction, energy use of a design base building must be less than or equal to 65 percent of the respective energy code base building and must be less than or equal to 75 percent for rehabilitation of a base building. (ii)\n\nTenant space. (a) For tenant space except office tenant space: For new construction, energy use of a design tenant space must be less than or equal to 65 percent of the respective energy code tenant space and must be less than or equal to 75 percent for rehabilitation of tenant space. (iii)\n\nFor office tenant space: For new construction, energy use of design tenant space must be less than or equal to 55 percent of the respective energy code tenant space and must be less than or equal to 65 percent for rehabilitation of such tenant space. (iv)\n\nWhole building. (a) For new construction where the floor area of office tenant space accounts for less than 90 percent of the floor area of all tenant spaces, energy use of a design whole building must be less than or equal to 65 percent of the respective energy code whole building and must be less than or equal to 75 percent for rehabilitation of a whole building. (b) For new construction where the floor area of office tenant space accounts for greater than or equal to 90 percent of the floor area of all tenant spaces, energy use of a design whole building must be less than or equal to 60 percent of the respective energy code whole building and less than or equal to 70 percent for rehabilitation of a whole building. (2)\n\nComputer modeling methods: This Part describes the hourly computer modeling methodology required to demonstrate that a base building, tenant space or whole building complies with the requirements of the energy use standards set forth in subdivision (c) of this section and as required by section\n19\nof the Tax Law. If calculations cannot show that changes made to the base building, tenant space or whole building do not decrease its energy efficiency, then the requirements of subdivision (c) of this section must be met again. (3)\n\nAcceptable computer programs: (i) Compliance with the energy use standards must be demonstrated using the DOE-2.1E computer program, specifically, any version from V86 through V110 inclusively, or an equivalent computer program. A computer program is considered equivalent if either of conditions in clause (\na\n) or (\nb\n) of this subparagraph are met: (a) The DOE-2.1E computer program, any version from V86 through V110 inclusively, has been modified without altering its computational algorithms. The following are acceptable modifications: (1)\n\nInput and/or output interface. (2)\n\nWhen compared to DOE-2.1E, specifically, any version between V86 and V110 inclusively, the capability of the computer program is increased to model larger size buildings and/or greater detail. (b) The computer program meets the DOE-2.1E equivalency requirements of\n\nNonresidential Alternative Calculation Method Approval Manual for the 1998 Energy Efficiency Standards for Nonresidential Buildings\ndated April 1998 and issued by the California Energy Commission under serial number P400-98-011. (ii)\n\nMethod for comparing the design base building and energy code base building for the purpose of verifying compliance with the energy use standards for the base building. To demonstrate compliance with the energy use standards for the base building, the energy code base building must be compared to the design base building using energy simulations as follows: (a) The energy code base building model and the design base building model must be created, and then energy simulations with these computer models must be performed. (b) Assign the type of cooling and heating systems to the energy code base building using Table 7.1 of this section, with exceptions as noted in this section. Table 7.1 of this section must be applied using the following definition for the size of cooling equipment installed (column 2). (1)\n\nIncluded in the definition: (i) all cooling equipment, including back-ups, except as noted in items (\nii\n) and (\niii\n) of this subclause; (ii)\nice storage systems; and\n(iii)\nevaporative cooling systems (direct or indirect). (2)\n\nExcluded from the definition: (i) air-to-air heat recovery system; (ii)\nglycol loop heat recovery system; and\n(iii)\ndesiccant dehumidification system. (3)\n\nIn buildings that include multifamily residences as well as other uses, the size of the installed cooling equipment must be accounted separately where it does not serve either: (i) residential units; or\n(ii)\nareas associated with the management of these residential units.

Split-system air-to-air heat pumps. electric\n1\n\nHeating and reheat fuel used in the space (Column 3) is the heating fuel used for most of the combined heating and reheating needs of a particular space, as defined by the \"Space Use\" column of Table 7.1. Where the design base building uses electric resistance heating or reheating, the \"heating and reheat fuel used in the space\" must be selected as fossil fuel. 2\n\nThe energy code base building model must use hot water if the design base building uses hot water, and the energy code base building model must use steam if the design base building (and thus the design base building model) uses steam. 3\n\nIf the design base building uses a furnace, then the energy code base building model must also use a furnace. If the design base building uses a boiler, then the energy code base building model must also use a boiler. The energy code base building model must use the same type of fossil fuel as that used in the design base building. 4\n\nThe chiller assigned to the energy code base building model must use the same energy source as the chiller assigned to the design base building. If the chiller in the design base building (and thus the design base building model) uses a particular type of fossil fuel, the chiller in the energy code base building model must be a single-effect absorption machine using the same type of fossil fuel. 5\n\nThe furnace or boiler in the energy code base building model must use the same fuel as the furnace or boiler in the design base building (and thus the design base building model). 6\n\nOffice spaces must use VAV system for the energy code base building model. In other spaces within the building, the energy code base building model must use the same type of air system as that used in the design base building. 7\n\nIf Table 7.1 requires the modeling in the energy code base building model of electric chillers with a total installed capacity greater than 150 tons (column 2), the type and number of these chillers must be assigned as follows: (i) \"Size of cooling equipment installed\" is >150 tons and <300 tons: Specify in the energy code base building model two equally-sized, reciprocating, air-cooled chillers. Exception: if the design base building uses only one chiller, also specify in the energy code base building model only one chiller. (ii)\n\"Size of cooling equipment installed\" is >300 tons: The energy code base building must use centrifugal water-cooled chillers, unless the design base building uses screw water-cooled chillers in conjunction with an ice storage system, in which case the energy code base building model must also have screw chillers, and a low-temperature air distribution system (but need not be modeled with an ice storage system). (a) The number of centrifugal chillers for the energy code base building model must be established as follows: (1)\nup to and including 600 tons: one chiller; (2)\n601 tons through 1600 tons: two chillers sized equally; (3)\nover 1600 tons: two chillers minimum, with chillers added so that no chiller is larger than 800 tons, all sized equally. (4)\nnotwithstanding the requirements of (1), (2) and (3) directly above, the number of chillers in the energy code base building model must not be higher than the number of chillers in the design base building model. (b) The number of screw chillers for the energy code base building model must be the same as that for the design base building model. (4)\n\nUnless otherwise specified in Table 7.1 of this section, the HVAC distribution system in the energy code base building model must be the same type as the HVAC distribution system in the design base building. (5)\n\nIf the design base building purchases hot water, steam or chilled water (instead of producing them in the building), the energy code base building model must make the same assumption. (6)\n\nBuildings with multiple types of cooling and/or heating systems. (i) If a space in the design base building uses a different type of cooling/heating system than the predominant use in the rest of the base building, and if this cooling/heating system is different because of the use of that space, then the energy code base building model must have the same type of cooling/heating system for that particular space. (ii)\n\nThe \"size of cooling equipment installed\" (Table 7.1, column 2 of this section) is determined by the whole building, even if there are several cooling systems in the building, except for multifamily residences as per subclause (iii)(\nb\n)(\n3\n) of this paragraph. (c) Energy simulation techniques for the energy code base building model and the design base building model. In modeling the base building, the following energy simulation techniques must be used: (1)\n\nEnergy code base building model. For the components that belong to the base building, assign values to the simulation parameters affecting energy use. The energy code base building model must be created by using the HVAC system type of Table 7.1 of this section and the modeling requirements of subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph. (i) The energy efficiency of all base building components must comply with the prescriptive requirements of the energy code. For multifamily residences, the energy code base building model must use the following values for fixed lighting installed in apartments, if fixed lighting is claimed as part of the base building: kitchen - 325 watts; each bathroom - 200 watts; dining room - 120 watts; hallway - 60 watts; entry space 60 - watts. (ii)\n\nThe energy code base building model must be coded to report in the output the following energy use that does not belong to the base building and that must be removed from the compliance calculations: (A)\nthe electricity used in the whole building by plug equipment and non-vehicular transportation equipment; and\n(B)\nthe electricity or fossil fuels used in the whole building by process equipment. (iii)\n\nThe effect of the aforementioned equipment on heating and cooling must not be removed from the compliance calculations. (iv)\n\nThe energy code base building model must have separate electrical meters for the lighting in the base building and the tenant spaces. Where domestic hot water is used by both the base building and tenant spaces, it must be metered separately for each. Similarly, if there are other end-uses common to both base building and tenant space(s), separate meters must be assigned to those end-uses. The energy use associated with components that belong to the tenant spaces must be excluded from the compliance calculation. (2)\n\nDesign base building model. For the components that belong to the base building, assign values to the simulation parameters affecting energy use. The components of the design base building must be modeled as built. The same procedure as for the energy code base building, per subclause (iii)(\nc\n)(\n1\n) of this paragraph, must be followed, with the following exception: Values for energy end-uses calculated in subclause (iii)(\nc\n)(\n1\n) of this paragraph may be used instead if repeating the analyses with the design base building model would yield the same results. (3)\n\nAssign values to the simulation parameters affecting energy use for the components that do not belong to the base building and are energy-using systems that are not part of the base building, i.e., are part of tenant spaces. The requirements of this paragraph must be followed when creating computer models for both the energy code base building and design base building. The following assumptions must be made: (i) Tenant-supplied lighting (not fixed lighting supplied by the base building owner) for residential apartments have the following values: each bedroom-120 watts; living room-300 watts; dining room-120 watts. (ii)\n\nIf the values for the parameters affecting energy use in one or more tenant spaces are known values, these values must be used for both the energy code base building model and the design base building model, except that no value can be less energy-efficient than that required by the energy code. (iii)\n\nIf the values of the parameters affecting energy use in one or more tenant spaces are unknown values, then both the energy code base building model and the design base building model must use the prescriptive energy efficiency values of the energy code for these spaces, except that lighting density (general lighting and task lighting) in tenant spaces that are not residential apartments must be as listed for each space type of Table 7.2 of this section. For residential apartments, the following values must be used for the combination of fixed lighting and occupant-provided lighting: each bedroom-120 watts; living room-300 watts; dining room-120 watts; each bathroom-200 watts; kitchen-325 watts; hallway-60 watts; and entrance space-60 watts.

(4)\n\nAssign peak electrical demand for plug equipment. The peak electrical demand of plug equipment must be assigned as follows in both the energy code base building model and in the design base building model: (i) Computer-intensive office areas: 2.0 watts per square foot. These areas assume 83 square feet per workstation with computer and monitor at each workstation, plus one printer and facsimile. This figure includes circulations of open floors, but does not include circulations enclosed by floor-to-ceiling walls. (ii)\n\nGeneral office areas, not included in computer-intensive office areas above: 1.5 watts per square foot. These areas assume 100 square feet per workstation with computer and monitor at each workstation, plus one printer and facsimile. These areas comprise typical open-office layouts, including circulations unenclosed by floor-to-ceiling walls, and small storage spaces and conference rooms less than 500 square feet. (iii)\n\nLarge conference rooms, not included in general office areas above: 1.0 watts per square foot. (iv)\n\nCorridors (enclosed by floor-to-ceiling walls) and storage areas not included in general office areas above, elevator lobbies, restrooms, janitorial areas: 0 watts per square foot. (v) Mainframe computer rooms: 50 watts per square foot, or according to design. A lower or higher figure may be used if verified through measurement. Adding nameplate ratings is not acceptable. (vi)\n\nResidential apartments: peak combined electrical demand must be no higher than 4 watts per square foot in each kitchen, 0.5 watts per square foot in each living room, 1.5 watts per square foot in each bedroom and is based on the following assumptions: audio-video equipment, electric clocks, electric appliances for personal hygiene in bathrooms, refrigerator/freezer, microwave, dishwasher. Electric range may add no more than 1 watt per square foot in each kitchen. (vii)\n\nOther space uses: maximum electrical use must account for the fact that not all equipment is used simultaneously. To perform the compliance analyses, the electrical use of plug equipment must be separately reported in the output of the computer models. (5)\n\nPerform energy simulations of the energy code base building model and the design base building model. (i) Energy use not assigned to the base building is metered in the computer model and reported in the simulation output. The electricity used by plug equipment and nonvehicular transportation equipment in the whole building, and the electrical and fossil fuels used by process equipment in the whole building is also metered. (ii)\n\nThe simulations must be performed for all hours in an entire year, using representative hourly meteorological data. (6)\n\nCalculate the energy use that does not belong to the base building. The energy use computed by the energy code base building model must be compared with the energy use computed by the design base building model after excluding the following: (i) Using the results from the simulations of the energy code base building model, add the kilowatt-hours (kwh) of all nonbase building uses, such as lighting in tenant spaces, plug equipment, nonvehicular transportation, and process equipment. Add the therms (or gallons, or hundreds of cubic feet [ccf]) for all nonbase building uses, such as domestic hot water (DHW) for tenant spaces and process equipment that uses fossil fuels. (ii)\n\nPerform the same calculations using results from the design base building model. In addition, as noted in subclause (\n2\n) of this clause, some results obtained with analyses of the energy code base building model may be used directly for design base building calculations. (7)\n\nCompare the energy use for the energy code base building to the energy use for the design base building in order to verify compliance with the energy use standards. (i) From the energy use predicted by both the energy code base building model and the design base building model, subtract the kilowatt-hours, and also the therms, gallons or ccf calculated in subclause (\n6\n) of this clause. (ii)\n\nConvert the results to source Btu. Use the actual Btu content of the energy source if known; otherwise use the conversion factors below: Btu = kwh × 10,000 = therms × 100,000 = cf natural gas × 1,027 = gallons of propane × 86,047 = gallons of #2 oil × 138,700 = gallons of #6 oil × 149,690\n(iii)\n\nIn order to meet the energy use requirements of this part, energy use for the design base building must meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, energy use standards. (iii)\n\nMethod for comparing the design building tenant space and the energy code tenant space for the purpose of verifying compliance with the energy use standards for tenant space. To demonstrate compliance with the energy use standards for tenant space, including the tenant improvements assigned to the tenant space in accordance with section\n638.4\nof this Part, the energy code tenant space must be compared to the design tenant space by creating an energy code tenant space model and performing energy simulations with these models. (a) Assign type of cooling/heating system to the energy code tenant space. If the tenant space applying for the green building credit has its own primary cooling equipment, the type of cooling/heating system in the tenant space must be assigned according to subclause (\n1\n) of this clause. Otherwise, the type of the HVAC distribution system must be assigned according to subclause (\n2\n) of this clause. Primary cooling equipment assignment to the tenant space must be determined in accordance with section\n638.4\nof this Part. (1)\n\nIf the design tenant space has its own primary cooling equipment, the type of cooling/heating system in the tenant space must be coded in the energy code tenant space model by using Table 7.1 of this section. In using Table 7.1 of this section, substitute the words \"tenant space\" for the words \"base building.\"\n(i) For a given\nspace type\n(as defined in Table 7.1 of this section), select a row in Table 7.1 of this section to determine the type of cooling system in the tenant space. The size of cooling equipment in Table 7.1, column 2 of this section must be the installed cooling equipment in the whole building, not just in the tenant space, except for, buildings with residential units as described in subclause (ii)(\nb\n)(\n3\n) of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nIf the applicable energy code cooling system is an air-cooled chiller, then the energy code tenant space model must use an air-cooled chiller plant for the tenant space. If the applicable energy code cooling system is water-cooled, then the energy code tenant space model must use a water-cooled chiller plant for the tenant space. The type and number of chillers (if applicable) in the plant that serves the tenant space in the energy code tenant space model must be selected as follows: (A)\n\nIf the installed size of the cooling equipment in the design tenant space is <150 tons, one chiller must be modeled. Electric chillers must be modeled as the reciprocating type. (B)\n\nIf the installed size of the cooling equipment in the design tenant space is >150 tons and <300 tons, two equally sized chillers must be modeled, unless the design tenant space uses only one chiller, in which case, the energy code tenant space model must code only one chiller. Electric chillers must be modeled as the reciprocating type. (C)\n\nIf the installed size of the cooling equipment in the design tenant space is >300 tons, water-cooled chillers must be modeled. The number of chillers assigned to the energy code tenant space model must be established as follows: (C)\nup to and including 600 tons: one chiller; (C)\n601 tons through 1600 tons: two chillers of equal size; (C)\nover 1600 tons: a minimum of two chillers with additional chillers added such that no chiller is larger than 800 tons, and all chillers are of equal size. (C)\n\nNotwithstanding the requirements immediately above, the number of chillers assigned to the energy code tenant space model must not be higher than the number of chillers assigned to the design tenant space model. Electric chillers must be modeled as the centrifugal type. (iii)\n\nUse the heating and reheat fuel used in the space (Table 7.1 of this section) appropriate for the whole building, unless the tenant space has its own primary heating equipment (per section\n638.4\nof this Part differentiating between base building and tenant spaces). If the design tenant space has its own primary heating equipment, the dominant fuel for the design tenant space must be coded in the energy code tenant space model, in accordance with footnote 1 of Table 7.1 of this section. (2)\n\nThe design tenant space does not have its own primary cooling equipment. (i) The type of HVAC distribution system in the energy code tenant space must the same type as the design tenant space model type. (ii)\n\nFor design tenant space with its own primary heating equipment (with the exception of electric resistance heating and geothermal heat pumps) the same system must be modeled in both the design tenant space model and the energy code tenant space model. For electric resistance heating and/or reheat systems, the energy code tenant space model must assume fossil fuel as the primary fuel. For geothermal heat pump systems, the energy code tenant space model must assume a water loop heat pump system with a fossil fuel-fired boiler and cooling tower as the primary fuel. (3)\n\nThe energy-efficiency of all HVAC and DHW equipment in the energy code tenant space must be modeled in accordance with the energy code energy-efficiency requirements. (b) Energy simulation techniques for the energy code tenant space model and the design tenant space model. (1)\n\nThe effect of the following components must be included in those instances where they are a tenant improvement: (i) lighting; (ii)\nscheduled lighting controls that turn lights off at a specified hour; (iii)\nfans and pumps, including controls; and\n(iv)\nother systems, e.g., water-cooled DX and associated controls. (2)\n\nThe effect of the following components must be eliminated: (i) the building envelope; (ii)\nfans and pumps, unless considered part of the tenant space as determined in accordance with section\n638.4\nof this Part; and\n(iii)\ncooling and heating equipment, unless considered part of the tenant space as determined in accordance with section\n638.4\nof this Part. (3)\n\nEnergy code tenant space model. Assign values for the parameters affecting energy use to components of the tenant space. (i) The energy efficiency of energy-using components that belong to the tenant space must comply with the prescriptive requirements of the energy code. (ii)\n\nAssign values for the parameters affecting energy use to tenant space components. (iii)\n\nThe energy-using components of tenant spaces for which an application is made must be modeled as built. (iv)\n\nFor energy-using systems that do not belong to the tenant improvements in the tenant space applying for green building credit, assign energy use values as follows: (A)\n\nIf a tax credit application is made for a specific tenant space, and the values of the parameters affecting energy use for other areas that do not apply for the tax credit are known values, these values must be used for both the energy code tenant space model and design tenant space model, except that no value can be less energy efficient than what is required by the energy code. (B)\n\nIf the values of the parameters affecting energy use for the base building and/or other tenant spaces are unknown values, the energy code tenant space model and the design tenant space model must both use the prescriptive values of the energy code for the systems belonging to the base building and/or other tenant spaces, except that lighting density (general lighting plus task lighting) in tenant spaces that are not residential apartments, must be listed for each space type within Table 7.2 of this section and residential apartments, must use the values listed under the heading exceptions, in item (ii)(\nc\n)(\ne\n)(\n3\n)(\niii\n) of this paragraph. (4)\n\nThe peak electric demand of plug equipment must be assigned to both the energy code tenant space model and the design tenant space model using the same figures as subclause (ii)(\nc\n)(\n4\n) of this paragraph.

(iv)\n\nMethod for comparing the design whole building and the energy code whole building for the purpose of verifying compliance with energy use standards. To demonstrate compliance with the energy use standards for a whole building, the energy code whole building must be compared to the design whole building by creating an energy code and design whole building model, and performing energy simulations with these computer models. (a) Assign HVAC systems to the energy code whole building and perform an energy simulation thereof by substituting the words\nwhole building\nfor the words\nbase building\nin clause (ii)(\nb\n) of this paragraph and Table 7.1 of this section.

Apply energy simulation techniques to calculate the energy use for the energy code and design whole building model and compare the two results in order to determine compliance with the energy use standards set forth in this subdivision, and as required in section\n19\nof the Tax Law. The following energy simulation techniques must be used: (1)\n\nCreate an energy code whole building model by assigning an HVAC system in accordance with clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph. All components, including the HVAC systems, must be modeled with the energy efficiency prescribed by the energy code. For residential apartments, the values listed under the heading exceptions, within item (ii)(\nc\n)(\n3\n)(\niii\n) of this paragraph must be used for the combination of fixed lighting and occupant-provided lighting. (2)\n\nModel the components of the design whole building as built, including all fixed lighting in residential apartments. For the purposes of the model, assume that tenant-supplied lighting for residential apartments meets the requirements of item (ii)(\nc\n)(\n3\n)(\ni\n) of this paragraph. (3)\n\nCode both the energy code and design whole building computer models so that the energy used by all the following components is reported separately in the output and the effect of these components on cooling and heating is not removed from the calculations: The electrical use of all plug equipment, nonvehicular transportation equipment, process equipment, and occupant-provided lighting in residential apartments. The fossil fuel use of process equipment must also be excluded from the calculations. (4)\n\nAssign the plug equipment peak electrical demand of subclause (ii)(\nc\n)(\n4\n) of this paragraph for both the energy code base building model and the design base building model. (5)\n\nPerform the energy simulations for both the energy code base building model and the design base building model using an hourly weather file considered appropriate for the region where the building which is the subject of the tax credit application is located. (6)\n\nIn order to verify compliance with the energy efficiency standards calculate the energy use that does not belong to the energy code and design whole building by comparing the energy use generated by the design whole building model after excluding the following: (i) The summation of the electrical kilowatt-hours of plug equipment; non-vehicular transportation equipment; electrical use of process equipment, if any; and the therms (or gallons, or ccf) for all process equipment based on the results of the computer simulations of the energy code whole building model per subclause (\n5\n) of this clause. (ii)\n\nPerform the same calculations using results from the design whole building model. (7)\n\nVerify compliance with the energy use standards by comparing energy use for the energy code whole building with the energy use for the design whole building. (i) Using the energy use predicted by the energy code whole building model and the design whole building model as specified in subclause (\n5\n) of this clause, subtract the kilowatt-hours and the therms or gallons or ccf calculated in subclause (\n6\n) of this clause. (ii)\n\nConvert the results calculated in item (\ni\n) of this subclause to source Btu using the actual Btu content of the energy source if known; otherwise, use the conversion factors below: BTU = kilowatt-hours × 10,000 = therms × 100,000 = cf natural gas × 1,027 = gallons of propane × 86,047 = gallons of #2 oil × 138,700 = gallons of #6 oil × 149,690\n(iii)\n\nIn order to meet the energy use requirements of this Part, energy use for the design whole building must meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, energy use standards. (v) Energy use modeling requirements. All modeling of energy use must comply with the following requirements: (a) Thermal zones. (1)\nA building area must be modeled as more than a single thermal zone if both of the following conditions exist: (i) temperatures are controlled by more than one thermostat; and\n(ii)\nthe heating or cooling loads are likely to be different in the spaces controlled by the respective thermostats. (2)\n\nSeparate thermal zones must be created for the following: (i) each facade (orientation) of the building; (ii)\ncorner rooms with windows on more than one exposure; (iii)\nopen-office corner areas with windows on more than one exposure and which are controlled by a separate thermostat; (iv)\ncore of the building; (v) top floor versus middle floors versus ground floor; (vi)\nfunctions with significantly different internal heat gains, or with significantly different operation schedules (\ne.g., general purpose offices versus computer-intensive areas); and\n(vii)\nreturn air plenums. (3)\nA separate thermal zone must not be created for restrooms if building air is exhausted through the restrooms, but should be treated as part of the thermal zone for the adjacent spaces. (b) HVAC systems. (1)\nHVAC systems must not be combined where: (i) they are served by different central plant equipment having different part-load characteristics; or\n(ii)\nthey serve areas with different magnitude or profiles for loads. (2)\nHVAC systems may be combined if they are similar and serve similar areas, e.g., DX systems installed on each floor of identical floors of an office building. (3)\n\nOutside air flow in both the energy code model and design model must be no less than required by the applicable building code. If the design model uses a higher outside air flow rate for purposes of better indoor air quality, then the energy code model must use the same (higher) outside air flow rate. However, the design model may receive credit for modulating down the outside air rate from any level that is code compliant or higher in order to account for changes in occupancy. (4)\n\nIn VAV systems, the same minimum position for the VAV boxes must be assigned to both the energy and design code model and model except where VAV boxes in the design base building or design tenant space are capable of closing during nonoccupied hours, this feature does not need to be coded in the energy code model. (c) Placement of glazed areas. Glazed areas must be positioned in a geometrically-correct manner on a facade if: (1)\n\nSignificant self-shading from the building itself is present, or there is a major obstruction of solar access\ne.g., other buildings, trees, relief. (2)\n\nGlass must not be aggregated within a thermal zone if it is nonuniformly shaded. (d) Thermal conductivity values for concrete masonry units and fibrous insulation: (1)\n\nConcrete masonry units. The R-value data from ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 1997, chapter 24, Table 4, \"Masonry Materials,\" must be used for concrete masonry units when performing any energy simulation model. Where ASHRAE does not provide the R-value for a masonry type used in the project, the R-value of such concrete masonry units must be obtained either by performing a three-dimensional heat-flow simulation, a two-dimensional heat-flow simulation, or an isothermal planes calculation, as described in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, 1997, chapter 24, pages 24.8 through 24.9, \"Masonry Walls.\"\n(2)\n\nFibrous insulation. The R-value for compressed fibrous insulation must be calculated by one of the following methods: (i) multiply the thickness of the insulation after having been compressed by the R-value/inch of the uncompressed insulation; (ii)\nuse manufacturers' data for compressed insulation; or\n(iii)\nuse published data for the R-value of compressed insulation based on tests. (e) U-Factors for building envelope assemblies. (1)\n\nThe following procedure must not be used for determining the U-Factor (or overall R-value) of a building envelope assembly: Parallel path calculations for walls, roofs, and floors built with steel members and with cavity insulation (\ne.g., 6 inch steel studs at 16 inches on center with R-19 insulation in between). (2)\n\nThe following methods for deriving the U-Factor (or overall R-value) of a building envelope assembly may be used (see section\n638.10\nof this Part): (i) ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999, Table A-10 (section A3.3) \"Assembly U-Factors for Steel Frame Walls\"; (ii)\nASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999, Table 11 (section A3-4) \"Assembly U-Factors for Wood Frame Walls\"; (iii)\nASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999, Table A-12 \"Assembly C-Factors for Below-Grade Walls\"; (iv)\nASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999, Table A-13 (section A5.2) \"Assembly U-Factor for Mass Floors\"; (v) ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999, Table A-14 (section A5.3) \"Assembly U-Factors\"; (vi)\nASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1999, Table A-15 (section A5.4) \"Assembly U-Factors for Wood Joist Floors\"; (vii)\nASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90A-1999, Table A-16 (section A6) \"Assembly F-Factors for Slab-on-Grade Floors\"; (viii)\nASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, 1997, chapter 24, pages 24.9 through 24.12 (\"Constructions Containing Metal,\" \"Zone Method of Calculation,\" and \"Modified Zone Method for Metal Stud Walls with Insulated Cavities\"); (ix)\nthree-dimensional heat-flow simulations; or\n(x) two-dimensional heat-flow simulations. (3)\n\nTo obtain the U-Factor in the spandrel panels of curtain walls, use data published by the manufacturer, perform a two or three-dimensional computer simulation, or use the \"Zone Method of Calculation\" (page 24.10 of ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, 1997). (4)\n\nCenter-of-glass U-Factor must not be used for modeling the U-Factor of entire windows (glass and frame). Any of the following three methods must be used instead: (i) The computer input must define the glass with the center-of-glass conductance separately from the frame conductance, but only if the simulation software being used to perform the energy models has the capability to separately define the thermal conductance of glass and frame. (ii)\n\nUnit U-factors of the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, 1997, chapter 29, Table 5 or the U-Factors of ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-1999, table A-17 (section A8.1) \"Assembly U-factors for Unlabeled Glazed Wall systems (Site-Built Windows) and Unlabeled Skylight.\"\n(iii)\nA rating by the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) for the entire window (NFRC, 1300 Spring Street, Suite 500, Silver Spring, MD 20910\nnfrcusa@aol.com\n). (f) Modeling of lighting. The following requirements must be followed when modeling lighting energy use: (1)\n\nLighting densities (watts per square foot) coded in the computer program must account for both general lighting and task lighting. Assign 0.2 watts per square foot for task lighting in office spaces, in addition to general lighting requirements. (2)\n\nUse a daylight dimming model in order to account for energy saved during hours without daylight. (3)\n\nAnalyze the effect of light shelves on thermal zones that are not adjacent to windows as follows: (i) The footcandle levels in the thermal zone that does not include the windows must be found by performing a simulation with a light analysis computer program such as Radiance or Adeline, both by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA 94720, or by using a scale model. This light level must be determined for at least one typical day in summer, winter, spring or fall, and for at least 3 hours (one morning, one noon and one afternoon) for each of those days. (ii)\n\nThe energy analysis model must be coded to reflect the energy savings due to natural light. A schedule that reduces the electric lighting during the day is an acceptable means to approximate the effect of daylight on thermal zones that do not include windows. (g) Schedules. (1)\n\nOccupancy schedules must not assume that all spaces are fully occupied simultaneously. (2)\n\nHeating temperature. (i) The modeled temperature in spaces for occupancy periods during the heating season must be no higher than 72 degrees Fahrenheit, except for residential rentals and daycare centers, where it must be no higher than 74 degrees Fahrenheit, and special uses such as swimming pool areas or saunas. (ii)\n\nHeating temperature schedules must assume that heating recovery from setback (if applicable) starts no more than two hours and no less than one hour before opening the building for occupancy. The heating temperature in the building must be ramped from the setback temperature to the temperature for the occupied space in approximately equal steps. (iii)\n\nCooling temperature schedules must assume that recovery from setup (if applicable) starts no more than one hour before occupancy. (iv)\n\nThe schedules for occupancy, lighting, plug equipment, process equipment heating, cooling, fan, pump, and outside air must be coordinated. (h) Central plant. (1)\n\nChillers. Where default curves in the computer program are inadequate, then equipment-specific part-load curves for chillers must be used. (2)\n\nCooling towers. The cooling tower size and number of cells must be assigned to the model. Where there is a water-side economizer, the set point temperature must also be assigned. (3)\n\nPumps. If the hot water pumps operate continuously throughout the heating season, and/or if chilled water pumps operate continuously throughout the cooling season, the computer models must account for this operation. (i) Verification. The design base building model, design tenant space model and design whole building models must produce an output where the number of hours undercooled, underheated, and the outside throttling range are no more than 10 percent higher when compared with the number of hours undercooled, underheated and outside the throttling range in the energy code base building, energy code tenant space, and energy code whole building, respectively. (d) Indoor air quality. For indoor air quality with respect to levels for carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, particulate matter, radon and total volatile organic compounds.

(iii)\n\nTo meet the requirements of the criteria set forth in items (\niv\n) and (\nv\n) of this subclause, any type of alternate supply water may be used singly or in combination. The various water types of alternate supply water may be combined at a point in the stream that is appropriate for the level of treatment each requires. The alternate supply water must be dyed using a permanent nontoxic dyeing system, to allow clear differentiation between the potable and nonpotable water streams at all times. (iv)\n\nCriterion 1: alternate supply water used for flushing urinals and toilets. (A)\n\nAll toilets and urinals belonging to the base building must be flushed with alternate supply water. (B)\n\nWater flow calculations must be performed by the professional engineer and must show that, in average over a year, the makeup water for toilet flush and urinal flush is no more than 10 percent of total water used for flushing. (v) Criterion 2: alternate supply water is used for 20 percent or more of the water needs of the base building. (A)\n\nAlternate supply uses include toilet and urinal flushing, laundry, car wash, fire sprinklers, fire fighting, landscape water features, or irrigation, and any other appropriate use of alternate supply water as determined by the professional engineer. (B)\n\nWater flow calculations must be performed by the professional engineer and must show that, in average over a year, the alternate supply water is used for more than 20 percent of total water used for the base building. (vi)\n\nInefficient use of alternate supply water may not be used to inflate the alternate supply water percentage. The alternate supply water must be used with the same water conservation measures that would be normally taken for potable water. (2)\n\nWater cascading. Only residential, motel and hotel buildings may comply with the requirements of this Part. Both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2, set forth in items (\ni\n) and (\nii\n) of this subclause, must be met. (i) Criterion 1: all private toilets cascade handwash water to the toilet bowl. (A)\nA qualifying fixture or arrangement must have a handwash basin with a faucet (\ni.e., a sink), located above a toilet. The handwash basin must have the drain directly connected to the toilet bowl. Upon flushing the toilet, water must automatically run through the faucet, providing users with the opportunity to wash their hands in potable water which is then directly and immediately introduced to the toilet bowl for the purpose of flushing. (B)\n\nWater used for hand washing must not be introduced into the toilet tank for storage but used directly for flushing. (C)\n\nIf the sink is used without need to flush the toilet, the water from the basin must still drain through the toilet. (D)\n\nInstallations which first use a portion of the toilet flush flow for hand washing may be supplied with potable water, or with alternate supply water appropriately treated for hand washing, or with a combination of the two. (ii)\n\nCriterion 2: all institutional laundry machines must reuse post-wash rinse water as laundry wash water. All institutional laundry machines (if any) on the premises must have and must utilize the capability of reusing post-wash rinse water as laundry wash water. (3)\n\nChecklists and field inspection.
