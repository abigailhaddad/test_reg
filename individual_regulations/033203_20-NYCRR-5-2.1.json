Tit. 20 §§ 5-2.1 - Employment incentive tax credit\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-B(2))\n(a) Where a corporation is allowed an\ninvestment tax credit under section 210-B(1), the corporation may be allowed an\nemployment incentive tax credit for each of the two years next succeeding the\ntaxable year for which the investment tax credit is allowed. The amount of the\nemployment incentive credit is a percentage of the investment credit base that\nvaries depending on the percentage increase in employment. The employment\nincentive credit will be allowed for any taxable year only if: (1)\nthe average number of employees during\nsuch taxable year is at least 101% of the average number of employees during\nthe taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year for which the\ninvestment tax credit is allowed; or\n(2)\nin case of a corporation that was not\nsubject to the tax imposed by article 9-A and did not have a taxable year\nimmediately preceding the taxable year for which the investment tax credit is\nallowed, the average number of employees in the taxable year for which the\ncredit under this Subpart is allowable is at least 101% of the average number\nof employees during the taxable year in which the investment tax credit is\nallowed. (b) The\nemployment incentive tax credit shall not reduce the tax to less than the fixed\ndollar minimum tax. If the corporation has excess employment incentive tax\ncredit after reducing the tax due to the fixed dollar minimum tax or the\ncorporation otherwise pays tax on the fixed dollar minimum, the excess credit\nmay be carried over to the fifteen taxable years immediately following such\ntaxable year and may be deducted from the corporation's tax for such year or\nyears. (c) A corporation entitled\nto claim the employment incentive tax credit must submit a Claim for Investment\n\nTax Credit that includes the employment incentive tax credit on Form CT-46 when\nclaiming the credit.
