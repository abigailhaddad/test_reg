  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.30 - Containment buildings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to owners or\noperators who store or treat hazardous waste in units designed and operated\nunder subdivision (b) of this section. The owner or operator is not subject to\nthe definition of land disposal in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle provided that the unit: (1)\nis a\ncompletely enclosed, self-supporting structure that is designed and constructed\nof humanmade materials of sufficient strength and thickness to support\nthemselves, the waste contents, and any personnel and heavy equipment that\noperate within the units, and to prevent failure due to pressure gradients, settlement, compression, or uplift, physical contact with the hazardous wastes\nto which they are exposed; climatic conditions; and the stresses of daily\noperation, including the movement of heavy equipment within the unit and\ncontact of such equipment with containment walls; (2)\nhas a primary barrier that is designed to\nbe sufficiently durable to withstand the movement of personnel and handling\nequipment within the unit; (3)\nif\nthe unit used to manage liquids, has: (i) a\nprimary barrier designed and constructed of materials to prevent migration of\nhazardous constituents into the barrier; (ii)\na liquid collection system designed and\nconstructed of materials to minimize the accumulation of liquid on the primary\nbarrier; and\n(iii)\na secondary\ncontainment system designed and constructed of materials to prevent migration\nof hazardous constituents into the barrier, with a leak detection and liquid\ncollection system capable of detecting, collecting, and removing leaks of\nhazardous constituents at the earliest possible time, unless the unit has been\ngranted a variance from the secondary containment system requirements under\nsubparagraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section; (4)\nhas controls sufficient to prevent\nfugitive dust emissions, in order to meet the no visible emission standard in\nclause (b)(3)(i)(\nd\n) of this section; and\n(5)\nis designed and operated to ensure\ncontainment and prevent the tracking of materials from the unit by personnel or\nequipment. (b) Design and operating standards. (1)\n\nAll containment buildings must comply\nwith the following design standards: (i) The\ncontainment building must be completely enclosed with a floor, walls, and a\nroof to prevent exposure to the elements (\ne.g., precipitation, wind, run-on), and to assure containment of managed wastes. (ii)\n\nThe floor and containment walls of the\nunit, including the secondary containment unit system if required under\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, must be designed and constructed of\nmaterials of sufficient strength and thickness to support themselves, the waste\ncontents, and any personnel and heavy equipment that operates within the unit, and to prevent failure due to pressure gradients, settlement, compression, or\nuplift, physical contact with the hazardous wastes to which they are exposed; climatic conditions; and the stresses of daily operation, including the\nmovement of heavy equipment within the unit and contact of such equipment with\ncontainment walls. The unit must be designed so that it has sufficient\nstructural strength to prevent collapse or other failure. All surfaces to be in\ncontact with hazardous wastes must be chemically compatible with those wastes. DEC will consider standards established by professional organizations generally\nrecognized by the industry such as the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and\nthe American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) in judging the structural\nintegrity requirements of this paragraph. If appropriate to the nature of the\nwaste management operation to take place in the unit, an exception to the\nstructural strength requirement may be made for light-weight doors and windows\nthat meet these criteria: (a) they provide an\neffective barrier against fugitive dust emissions under clause\n(3)(i)(\nd\n) of this subdivision; and\n(b) the unit is designed and operated in a\nfashion that assures that wastes will not actually come into contact with these\nopenings. (iii)\n\nIncompatible hazardous wastes or treatment reagents must not be placed in the\nunit or its secondary containment system if they could cause the unit or\nsecondary containment system to leak, corrode, or otherwise fail. (iv)\nA containment building must have a\nprimary barrier designed to withstand the movement of personnel, waste, and\nhandling equipment in the unit during the operating life of the unit and\nappropriate for the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste to be\nmanaged. (2)\n\nFor a\ncontainment building used to manage hazardous wastes containing free liquids or\ntreated with free liquids (the presence of which is determined by the paint\nfilter test, a visual examination, or other appropriate means), the owner or\noperator must include: (i) a primary barrier\ndesigned and constructed of materials to prevent the migration of hazardous\nconstituents into the barrier (\ne.g., a geomembrane covered by\na concrete wear surface); (ii)\na\nliquid collection and removal system to prevent the accumulation of liquid on\nthe primary barrier of the containment building: (a) the primary barrier must be sloped to\ndrain liquids to the associated collection system; and\n(b) liquids and waste must be collected and\nremoved to minimize hydraulic head on the containment system at the earliest\npracticable time that protects human health and the environment; (iii)\na secondary containment\nsystem including a secondary barrier designed and constructed to prevent\nmigration of hazardous constituents into the barrier, and a leak detection\nsystem that is capable of detecting failure of the primary barrier and\ncollecting accumulated hazardous wastes and liquids at the earliest practicable\ntime; (a) the requirements of the leak\ndetection component of the secondary containment system are satisfied by\ninstallation of a system that is, at a minimum: (1)\nconstructed with a bottom slope of one\npercent or more; and\n(2)\nconstructed of a granular drainage material with a hydraulic conductivity of 1\n×- 10\n-2\ncm/sec or more and a thickness of 12\ninches (30.5 cm) or more, or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage\nmaterials with a transmissivity of 3 ×- 10\n-5\nm\n2\n/sec or more; (b) if treatment is to be conducted in the\nbuilding, an area in which such treatment will be conducted must be designed to\nprevent the release of liquids, wet materials, or liquid aerosols to other\nportions of the building; (c) the\nsecondary containment system must be constructed of materials that are\nchemically resistant to the waste and liquids managed in the containment\nbuilding and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the\npressure exerted by overlaying materials and by any equipment used in the\ncontainment building. (Containment buildings can serve as secondary containment\nsystems for tanks placed within the building under certain conditions. A\ncontainment building can serve as an external liner system for a tank, provided\nit meets the requirements of section\n373-3.10\n[d][5][i]\nof this Subpart. In addition, the containment building must meet the\nrequirements of section\n373-3.10\n[d][2] and\n[3]\nof this Subpart to be considered an\nacceptable secondary containment system for a tank.)\n(iv)\n\nFor existing units other than 90-day\ngenerator units, the commissioner may accept a determination by the EPA\nregional administrator to delay the secondary containment requirement for up to\ntwo years, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator that the unit\nsubstantially meets the standards of this section. In making this\ndemonstration, the owner or operator must: (a) have provided written notice to the EPA\nregional administrator of their request by February 18, 1993. This notification\nmust describe the unit and its operating practices with specific reference to\nthe performance of existing containment systems, and specific plans for\nretrofitting the unit with secondary containment; (b) respond to any comments from the EPA\nregional administrator on these plans within 30 days; and\n(c) fulfill the terms of the revised plans, if such plans are approved by the EPA regional administrator. (3)\n\nOwners or operators\nof all containment buildings must: (i) use\ncontrols and practices to ensure containment of the hazardous waste within the\nunit; and, at a minimum: (a) maintain the\nprimary barrier to be free of significant cracks, gaps, corrosion, or other\ndeterioration that could cause hazardous waste to be released from the primary\nbarrier; (b) maintain the level of\nthe stored/treated hazardous waste within the containment walls of the unit so\nthat the height of any containment wall is not exceeded; (c) take measures to prevent the tracking of\nhazardous waste out of the unit by personnel or by equipment used in handling\nthe waste. An area must be designated to decontaminate equipment and any\nrinsate must be collected and properly managed; and\n(d) take measures to control fugitive dust\nemissions such that any openings (doors, windows, vents, cracks, etc.) exhibit\nno visible emissions. In addition, all associated particulate collection\ndevices (\ne.g., fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator) must\nbe operated and maintained with sound air pollution control practices. This\nstate of no visible emissions must be maintained effectively at all times\nduring normal operating conditions, including when vehicles and personnel are\nentering and exiting the unit; (ii)\nobtain, and keep on-site, certification\nby an independent, qualified professional engineer registered in New York State\nthat the containment building design meets the requirements of paragraphs (1)\nthrough (3) of this subdivision; (iii)\nthroughout the active life of the\ncontainment building, if the owner or operator detects a condition that could\nlead to or has caused a release of hazardous waste, the owner or operator must\nrepair the condition promptly, in accordance with the following procedures; (a) upon detection of a condition that has\nled to a release of hazardous waste (\ne.g., upon detection of\nleakage from the primary barrier) the owner or operator must: (1)\nenter a record of the discovery in the\nfacility operating record; (2)\nimmediately remove the portion of the containment building affected by the\ncondition from service; (3)\ndetermine what steps must be taken to repair the containment building, remove\nany leakage from the secondary collection system, and establish a schedule for\naccomplishing the cleanup and repairs; and\n(4)\nwithin seven days after the discovery of\nthe condition, notify the commissioner of the condition, and within 14 working\ndays, provide a written notice to the commissioner with a description of the\nsteps taken to repair the containment building, and the schedule for\naccomplishing the work. (b) The commissioner will review the\ninformation submitted, make a determination whether the containment building\nmust be removed from service completely or partially until repairs and cleanup\nare complete, and notify the owner or operator of the determination and the\nunderlying rationale in writing. (c) Upon completing all repairs and cleanup, the owner or operator must notify the commissioner in writing and provide a\nverification, signed by a qualified, professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork State, that the repairs and cleanup have been completed according to the\nwritten plan submitted in accordance with subclause\n(\na\n)(\n4\n) of this subparagraph. (iv)\n\nInspect and record in the\nfacility's operating record, at least once every seven days, data gathered from\nmonitoring equipment and leak detection equipment as well as the containment\nbuilding and the area immediately surrounding the containment building to\ndetect signs of releases of hazardous waste. (4)\n\nFor a containment building that contains\nboth areas with and without secondary containment, the owner or operator must: (i) design and operate each area in\naccordance with the requirements enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (3) of\nthis subdivision; (ii)\ntake\nmeasures to prevent the release of liquids or wet materials into areas without\nsecondary containment; and\n(iii)\nmaintain in the facility's operating log a written description of the operating\nprocedures used to maintain the integrity of areas without secondary\ncontainment. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commissioner may waive\nrequirements for secondary containment for a permitted containment building\nwhere the owner or operator demonstrates that the only free liquids in the unit\nare limited amounts of dust suppression liquids required to meet occupational\nhealth and safety requirements, and where containment of managed wastes and\nliquids can be assured without a secondary containment system. (c) Closure and post-closure\ncare. (1)\n\nAt closure of a containment\nbuilding, the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate all waste\nresidues, contaminated containment system components (liners, etc.), contaminated subsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste and\nleachate, and manage them as hazardous waste unless section\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title applies. The closure plan, closure activities, cost estimates for\nclosure, and financial responsibility for containment buildings must meet all\nof the requirements specified in sections 373-3.7 and\n373-3.8\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nIf, after removing or decontaminating all\nresidues and making all reasonable efforts to effect removal or decontamination\nof contaminated components, subsoils, structures, and equipment as required in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the owner or operator finds that not all\ncontaminated subsoils can be practicably removed or decontaminated, the owner\nor operator must close the facility and perform post-closure care in accordance\nwith the closure and post- closure requirements that apply to landfills (see\nsection\n373-2.14\n[g]\nof\nthis Title). In addition, for the purposes of closure, post-closure, and\nfinancial responsibility, such a containment building is then considered to be\na landfill, and the owner or operator must meet all of the requirements for\nlandfills specified in sections 373-3.7 and\n373-3.8\nof this Subpart.
