When\nlong-term debt is reacquired or redeemed without being converted into another\nform of long-term debt and when the transaction is not in connection with a\nrefunding operation (primarily redemptions for sinking fund purposes), the\ndifference between the amount paid upon reacquisition and the face value; plus\nany unamortized premium less any related unamortized debt expense and\nreacquisition costs; or less any unamortized discount, related debt expense and\nreacquisition costs applicable to the debt redeemed, retired and cancelled, shall be included in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account\n426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate. (c) Reacquisition, with refunding.

If the utility desires to amortize any\nof the discount, expense, or premium associated with the issuance or redemption\nof the first issue over a period subsequent to the date of redemption, the\npermission of the commission must be obtained. (d) When the utility chooses to use the\noptional privilege of deferring the tax on the gain attributable to the\nreacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for\ntax purposes, pursuant to section\n108\nof the Internal Revenue Code, the\nrelated tax effect shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting\npurposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the\nassociated property on a vintage year basis.

In that event the related portion of the tax effects\nshall be allocated to nonutility operations. Where it can be established that\nreacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility\noperations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility\noperations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net\ninvestment in nonutility plant.
