  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-8.5 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following provisions are also applicable for the\nreview of applications under this Subpart. (a) 'Ambient air increments'. Concentration\nlimitations necessary to assure that in areas designated as Federal class I, class II, or class III, increases in any regulated NSR contaminant\nconcentration over the baseline concentration do not exceed those listed in\n\nSubpart 231-12 of this Part. (b) 'Ambient air ceilings'. For any regulated NSR contaminant for a period of\nexposure, no concentration of that regulated NSR contaminant is allowed to\nexceed the lower of the following: (1)\nthe\nconcentration permitted under the national secondary ambient air quality\nstandard; or\n(2)\nthe concentration\npermitted under the national primary ambient air quality\nstandard. (c) 'Restrictions on area classifications and redesignation'. (1)\n\nAll areas of the State are designated\nclass II as identified in department policy documents, but may be redesignated\nas provided in this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe following areas may be redesignated\nonly as Federal class I: (i) an area which as\nof August 7, 1977, exceeded 10,000 acres in size and was a national monument, a\nnational primitive area, a national preserve, a national recreational area, a\nnational wild and scenic river, a national wildlife refuge, a national\nlakeshore or seashore; and\n(ii)\na\nnational park or national wilderness area established after August 7, 1977, which exceeds 10,000 acres in size. (3)\n\nThe State may submit to the administrator\na proposal to redesignate areas in the State as class I according to the\nprovisions established by\n40 CFR part\n51.166. (d) 'Exclusions from increment consumption'. (1)\n\nThe following concentrations must be\nexcluded in determining compliance with the maximum allowable ambient air\nincrement: (i) concentrations attributable to\nthe increase in emissions from facilities which have converted from the use of\npetroleum products, natural gas, or both by reason of an order in effect under\nsection 2(a) and (b) of the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of\n1974 (or any superseding Federal legislation) over the emissions from such\nfacilities before the effective date of such an order; (ii)\nconcentrations attributable to the\nincrease in emissions from facilities which have converted from using natural\ngas by reason of any applicable natural gas curtailment plan in effect pursuant\nto the Federal Power Act (or any other superseding Federal legislation) over\nthe emissions from such facilities before the effective date of such\nplan; (iii)\nconcentrations\nattributable to the increase in emissions from construction of other temporary\nemission related activities at the facility; (iv)\nincrease in concentrations attributable\nto new facilities outside the United States over the concentrations\nattributable to existing facilities which are included in the baseline\nconcentration; and\n(v) for\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, no exclusion of such\nconcentrations applies more than two years after the effective date which is\napplicable. If both such order and plan are applicable, no such exclusion\napplies more than five years after the later of such effective\ndates. (2)\n\nConcentrations\nattributable to the temporary increase in emissions of\nSO\n2, PM, or NO\nx\nfrom facilities\nwhich are limited to less than one year in duration are excluded, provided the\ndepartment: (i) approves the time over which\nthe temporary emissions increase of SO\n2, PM, or\nNO\nx\nwould occur; (ii)\nspecifies that the time period for\nexcluding certain contributions in accordance with this subdivision, is not\nrenewable; (iii)\nallows no\nemissions increase from a facility which would: ('a')\nimpact a Federal class I area or an\narea where an applicable increment is known to be violated; or\n('b')\ncause a violation or contribute to a\nknown violation of a national ambient air quality standard; (iv)\nrequires limitations to be in effect at\nthe end of the time period specified in accordance with this subdivision, which\nwould ensure that the emissions levels from facilities would not exceed those\nlevels occurring from such facilities before the exclusion was\napproved. (e) 'Stack heights'. The degree of emission limitation required for control of any\nregulated NSR contaminant under this Subpart must not be affected in any manner\nby: (1)\na stack height, not in existence\nbefore December 31, 1970, as exceeds good engineering practice, pursuant to\n40\nCFR\n51.100(ii); or\n(2)\nany other dispersion technique not\nimplemented before December 31, 1970. (f) 'Requirements for sources impacting\n\nFederal class I areas:'\n(1)\n\nNotice to EPA and\n\nFederal land manager. The department or the applicant, at the request of the\ndepartment, shall submit a copy of the permit application and all relevant\ninformation to the EPA region 2 office and the Federal land manager within 30\ndays of receipt of the application. (2)\n\nFederal land manager. The Federal land\nmanager and the Federal official charged with direct responsibility for\nmanagement of such lands have an affirmative responsibility to protect the\nAQRVs (including visibility) of such lands and to consider, in consultation\nwith the department, whether a proposed new or modified facility will have an\nadverse impact on such values. (3)\n\nVisibility analysis and AQRV analysis. The department must consider any\nanalysis performed by the Federal land manager, provided prior to the date of\npublication of the draft permit that shows that a proposed new major facility\nmay have an adverse impact on visibility or other AQRV in any Federal class I\narea. Where the department finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate to\nthe satisfaction of the department that an adverse impact on visibility or\nother AQRV will result in the Federal class I area, the department must, in the\nnotice of public hearing on the permit application, either explain its decision\nor give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained. (4)\n\nDenial of a permit based on adverse\nimpact on AQRVs. The Federal land manager of any such lands may demonstrate to\nthe department that the emissions from a proposed modification to a facility\nwould have an adverse impact on the AQRVs (including visibility) of those\nlands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions\nfrom the proposed modification to the facility would not cause or significantly\ncontribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases\nfor a Federal class I area. If the department concurs with such demonstration, then it must not issue the permit. (5)\n\nFederal class I variances. The owner or\noperator of a facility proposing a modification may demonstrate to the Federal\nland manager that the emissions from the modification to the facility would\nhave no adverse impact on the air quality related values (including visibility)\nof any such lands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting\nfrom emissions from the modification to the facility would cause or contribute\nto concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a\n\nFederal class I area. If the Federal land manager concurs with such\ndemonstration and so certifies, provided that the applicable requirements of\nthis section are otherwise met, the State may issue the permit with such\nemission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of\nSO\n2, PM, and NO\nx\nwould not exceed\nthe maximum allowable increases over minor source baseline concentration as\nlisted in table 7 of Subpart 231-13 of this Part. (6)\nSO\n2\nvariance by\ngovernor of the Federal class I area with Federal land manager's concurrence. The owner or operator of a facility proposing a modification which cannot be\napproved under paragraph (4) of this subdivision may demonstrate to the\ngovernor of the Federal class I area that the modification to the facility\ncannot be constructed by reason of any maximum allowable increase for\nSO\n2\nfor a period of 24 hours or less applicable to any\n\nFederal class I area, and that a variance under this paragraph would not\nadversely affect the air quality related values of the area (including\nvisibility). The governor of the Federal class I area, after consideration of\nthe Federal land manager's recommendation (if any) and subject to his or her\nconcurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance from such\nmaximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the department will\nissue a permit to the facility, provided that the applicable requirements of\nthis Subpart are otherwise met. In this instance, the\nSO\n2\nconcentrations must meet the maximum allowable\nincrease in SO\n2\nconcentrations in table 8 of Subpart\n231-13 of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
