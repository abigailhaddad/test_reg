  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.26 - In-service education - nursing\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1660 ]\n(a) Nursing in-service education\nactivities\nare defined as educational activities conducted by the\nhospital for hospital nursing personnel. The cost of time spent by nursing\npersonnel as students in such classes and activities must remain in the cost\ncenter in which their normal salary and wage costs are charged\n(\ni.e., the cost center in which they work). However, the cost\n(defined as salary, wages and payroll-related fringe benefits) of time spent in\nsuch classes and activities by those instructing and administering the programs\nmust be included in the Nursing Administration cost center (account 8750). For\nthose hospitals that want to account for these costs separately, an In-service\n\nEducation - Nursing sub-account (account 8751) has been provided. (b) If instructors do not work full-time in\nthe in-service programs, the cost (as defined above) of the portion of time\nthey spend working in the in-service education program must be included in the\n\nNursing Administration cost center. This may be accomplished by direct\ndistribution of these costs (by natural classification of expense category)\neach payroll period based upon actual hours worked. (c) The costs of nursing in-service education\nsupplies (such as cassettes, books, medical supplies, etc.) and outside\nlecturers must also be reflected in the Nursing Administration cost center. Nursing in-service education does not include orientation of new employees. Such orientation costs must be charged to the cost center in which the new\nemployees are, or will be, assigned. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.26\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
