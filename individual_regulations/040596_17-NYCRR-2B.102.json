Tit. 17 § 2B.102 - Supplemental Intersection Signs (NYR3-14, NYR3-19, NYR3-20)\n\nState Regulations\n\nOption: 01 The ALL TRAFFIC (NYR3-14) sign (see Sign Drawing SD-R3)\nmay be used where all traffic on an intersection approach is allowed to proceed\nthrough the intersection in one direction only. 02 The LEFT TURN ONLY (NYR3-19) and RIGHT TURN ONLY\n(NYR3-20) signs (see Sign Drawing SD-R3) may be used where all traffic on an\nintersection approach is required to turn left or turn right, respectively. 03 Supplemental Intersection signs may be used at the\njunction of an alley or driveway with a roadway or highway, regardless of\nwhether or not the roadway or highway at said junction is controlled by a\ntraffic control device. Standard: 04 The ALL TRAFFIC sign shall not be a substitute for other\none-way signs required, or normally used, at intersections. Guidance: 05 Where used, the ALL TRAFFIC sign should normally be\nplaced in advance of an intersection on the right side of the roadway. 06 Where used, the LEFT TURN ONLY and RIGHT TURN ONLY signs\nshould be placed in the near right corner of the intersection. On one-way\nroadways, an additional sign should be placed in the near left corner of the\nintersection. Option: 07 The arrow on the ALL TRAFFIC sign may be vertical, horizontal (left or right), or slant diagonally upward (left or\nright). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
