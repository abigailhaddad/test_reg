  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 201.17 - Lawn crypts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A lawn\ncrypt is a single or double receptacle designed for encasement of casketed\nhuman remains set into a recess in the earth. No cemetery may install a lawn\ncrypt except in accordance with a plan submitted to the Cemetery Board and\nacted upon in accordance with the provisions of this directive. A lawn crypt\nmay be installed anywhere in the cemetery provided that its location adheres to\nsuch plan and it is installed in conformity with such plan. (b) Every application and proposed lawn crypt\nplan shall be submitted to the director of the Division of Cemeteries. All such\nplans shall meet the design and performance standards set forth in subdivision\n(c) of this section. The application shall specify: (1)\n\nThe means of financing the purchase and\ninstallation of the lawn crypt to be employed by the cemetery. (2)\n\nThe method of drainage to be used by the\ncemetery, including the results of percolation tests performed by an engineer\nlicensed by the State of New York. (3)\nA statement from the company and/or the\norganization manufacturing and/or installing the lawn crypts stating that the\nlawn crypts meet the design and performance standards of subdivision (c) of\nthis section. (4)\n\nAny additional\ninformation specifically relating to items in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3)\ndeemed by the director to be necessary to make a determination. (c) Design and performance\nstandards. (1)\n\nGeneral. (i) The earth cover above the units shall be\na minimum of 18\" of fill as specified by the engineer and a maximum of\n48\"\n(ii)\n\nCrypts shall, at a\nminimum, be 6' distant from the edge of the road. (iii)\n\nCrypts shall be set on a base of 12\" of\ncompacted select granular fill or as recommended by a soil evaluation conducted\nby a professional engineer licensed by the State of New York. (iv)\n\nPositive drainage beneath the crypts\nshall be designed by a competent engineer using appropriate soil and survey\ndata as specified in this directive. (v) Area between crypts shall be filled and\ncompacted with sand or fine stone fill to prevent settlement of top\nsoil. (2)\n\nConcrete. (i) The concrete cylinder compressive\nstrength must test 4,500 psi plus or minus 10 percent at the end of 28 days\nafter manufacture thereof. (ii)\n\nEntrained air shall be five percent to nine percent by volume. (3)\n\nDesign notes. (i) The manufacturer of the reinforced\nconcrete design must provide a certificate signed by a professional engineer\nlicensed by the State of New York that the lawn crypt will perform to withstand\na dead load specified in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph and a live load\nspecified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, which will permit it to\nfunction for the purpose of a lawn crypt. (ii)\n\nDead loads will consist of the weight of\nstructure, earth fill, snow loads and any other material that may produce a\nstatic load. (iii)\n\nLive loads will\nconsist of vehicle and pedestrian loads normally encountered in a cemetery and\nthe minimum design wheel load shall be 4,000 lbs. (iv)\n\nLateral earth pressure loads shall be\ncomputed by the Rankine Method using the appropriate soil parameters; the\nminimum equivalent pressure used shall be 36 psf per foot depth. Lateral\npressure induced by live loads on the ground surface shall be considered to be\nequivalent to a 2' depth of earth. (4)\n\nOther materials. (i) Crypts may be constructed of material\nother than concrete provided the above standards are met. (d) Procedures for applications. (1)\n\nThe director shall within 30 days of\nreceipt of the application notify the cemetery of any additional information\nrequired by the division. The application shall be deemed complete on the 60th\nday after the division receives the application, unless such a letter is\nissued. If additional information is requested, the application shall be\ncomplete upon the submission of the requested information. (2)\n\nThe Cemetery Board shall have 90 days\nfrom the date on which the application is deemed complete within which to\nobject to the application. Failure to so object shall mean that the Cemetery\n\nBoard has no objection to the application. (3)\n\nIf the Cemetery Board shall object to the\napplication, it shall notify the cemetery of its reasons in writing. The\ncemetery may not install any lawn crypts until such objection has been\nwithdrawn. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n201.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
