  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2500.16 - Lists of actions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe purpose of this section is to simplify the task of\ndetermining whether or not a proposed action may have a significant effect on\nthe environment by identifying for agencies actions or classes of actions that\nare likely to have a significant effect and those which will not have a\nsignificant effect. Because of the complex and varied nature of agency actions, the lists in this section are not all inclusive. The omission from the lists of\nan action does not mean that it is exempt from this Part, nor does it mean that\nit is automatically an action requiring environmental impact statement\npreparation. The criteria set forth in 6 NYCRR\n617.9\nshall be used to determine\nsignificance with respect to actions not listed in this section. (a) Type I actions or classes of actions are\nlikely to, but will not necessarily, require preparation of environmental\nimpact statements because they will in almost every instance have a significant\neffect on the environment. The following physical activities of the authority\nare examples of Type I actions or classes of actions: (1)\n\nThe construction of new pavements, trails, structures or terrain features that exceed specific thresholds of cost, dimension and location set by the authority. (2)\n\nThe addition or modification of terrain\nfeatures such as the creation of lakes, ponds and other bodies of standing\nwater; plantation plantings; forest cutting; major changes in contours, slopes\nand landforms; dredging and filling on land or in water; drainage modification; disposal areas and landfills; the stabilization of dunes and accretionary\nprocesses; the operation of flow control systems; and, channel\nrehabilitation. (3)\n\nThe performance\nof certain maintenance activities such as: chemical treatments; road salting; fertilization and material stockpiling when these activities exceed the\nspecific thresholds for cost, dimension and location set by the\nauthority. (b) Type II\nactions or classes of actions have been determined by the authority not to have\na significant effect on the environment and do not require environmental impact\nstatements unless the authority determines that such action would be located in\na particularly sensitive environmental setting where an otherwise insignificant\nimpact could become significant. The following physical activities of the\nauthority are examples of Type II actions and classes of actions: (1)\n\nReconstruction and rehabilitation\nactivities on existing pavement or trail such as: functional improvements; safety improvements; resurfacing; and, minor alignment modifications. (2)\n\nThe reconstruction and rehabilitation of\nexisting structures such as: buildings; bridges; shore protection structures; docks; boat launching facilities; drainage and water systems; electrical, sanitary and other utility systems; swimming pools; and, fencing. (3)\n\nThe reconstruction, rehabilitation and\nreplacement of features that have become part of the local natural or\nartifically-sustained terrain such as: replacement of non-native plantings; manipulation of surface drainage systems, culverts and canals; maintenance of\nwater tables, beach regrading; and, slope stabilization and\nmaintenance. (4)\n\nMaintenance and\nemergency procedures such as: emergency pest control; snow removal; firefighting; neutralization of cave-ins and drill holes; and the work\nperformed to mitigate the effects of landslides, oil spills, floods, rockfalls, tree falls, intense erosion, and the effects of extreme weather\nconditions.
