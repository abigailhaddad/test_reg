  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 79.20 - Inspection procedure generally\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The items set forth in sections 79.21\nthrough\n79.28\nof this Part are to be\ninspected and the prescribed standards must be met before a certificate of\ninspection can be issued. An inspection rejection notice is to be given to the\noperator if the condition of any item required to be inspected is found\ndefective, unless the necessary repairs are made before the motor vehicle\nleaves the premises of the inspection station licensee. A rejection notice is\nNOT an extension of an expired inspection certificate with the exception that a\nvehicle that has failed an OBD II emissions inspection may be issued a\nrejection notice with an extension for the purpose of verifying emission\nrepairs and preparing the vehicle for reinspection, as directed by the NYVIP\nCVIS. A receipt or invoice must be given to the motorist for the actual cost of\nthe inspection. The receipt or invoice must contain the following information: (1)\ndate of inspection; (2)\nfacility number; (3)\ncertified inspector number; (4)\nvehicle information (year, make, mileage, plate number, or VIN if the vehicle has no plate); (5)\nthe actual fee charged the motorist for\nthe inspection; (6)\nresults of the\ninspection (pass, fail), including any required advisory notifications to the\nmotorist such as the air bag warning light malfunction advisory (see section\n79.21\n[k]\nof this\n\nPart) or the tire pressure out-of-range advisory (see sections\n79.21\n[c], 79.27\n[a]\nand\n79.28\n[f]\nof this\n\nPart); and\n(7)\nthe inspection\ncertificate number, if the vehicle passes inspection. If the vehicle passes an inspection at an official\nemissions inspection station, the inspection station must give the customer the\nmotorist copy of the inspection receipt which is printed by the NYVIP CVIS. If\nthe vehicle fails the inspection, the motorist must be given the inspection\nreceipt that is printed by the NYVIP CVIS. Although the CVIS generated\ninspection receipt satisfies the requirements of this section, the station may, in addition, issue a standard receipt. (b) All inspections, except brake\nequalization tests, must be conducted within the enclosed portion of the\npremises of the official inspection station conducting the inspection. This\nregulation shall not apply to trailers required to be inspected under the\nprovisions of section\n79.22\nof this Part. It shall be\npermissible to conduct the diesel emissions test of a diesel safety/emissions\ninspection outside the station only if the station does not have sufficient\nexhaust ventilation. The remainder of such inspection must be conducted within\nthe enclosed portion of the station. (c) Certified inspector procedure. Upon\naccepting a vehicle for the purpose of conducting an official inspection of\nsuch vehicle pursuant to this section, the certified inspector shall conduct\nsuch inspection in the following manner: (1)\n\nTo complete the appropriate vehicle inspection record (VS-1074), or make\nappropriate and accurate entries in the CVIS, obtain the information necessary\nfrom any of the following: the vehicle, the windshield registration or\nwindshield inspection certificate, the registration document (MV-639TR) or\nphotocopy, a temporary registration (form MV-149), a certificate of sale (form\nMV-50), a certificate of title (form MV-999), a manufacturer's certificate of\norigin, a manufacturer's statement of origin, a salvage certificate (form\nMV-907A) or photocopy, a notice of registration acceptability (form VS-103), or\nan out-of-state registration or ownership document. If there is not VIN plate\nor state-issued VIN number (NYS or any other state), and none of the\nabove-mentioned documents are presented, the inspection station must refuse to\nperform the inspection. (2)\n(i) The inspector, service writer or other\nauthorized representative at an official emissions inspection station shall ask\nthe customer if the vehicle has been inspected and/or rejected within the past\n30 days, and shall request any rejection notice(s) pertaining to such\ninspection(s). Failure to request this information would require the station to\nperform a portion of the inspection at no charge to the customer if the CVIS\nlater determines that the vehicle has passed that portion at another station\nwithin 30 days. (ii)\n\nWhen prompted\nby the NYVIP CVIS, the certified inspector will scan the bar coded reinspection\ninformation printed on the rejection notice by the CVIS, to determine the\ncorrect reinspection. (3)\n\nAt the start of the inspection, the\ncertified inspector shall remove or obtain any expired certificates of\ninspection, after being utilized for data entry, if required, and 10-day time\nextension certificates (form VS-1077) or temporary certificates of emissions\nwaivers (form VS-1078) from the windshield or other location on the vehicle. Any inspection certificates or temporary certificates which are not yet expired\nare to be left on the vehicle until the vehicle passes inspection. (4)\n\nIf the vehicle identification number\n(VIN) plate is missing or mutilated beyond recognition, complete form VS-110\n(Notice of Missing or Mutilated Vehicle Identification Number) and mail it to\naddress on form within 24 hours. A multilated or missing VIN plate is not a\ncause for rejection or refusal to perform an inspection. (5)\n[Reserved]\n(6)\nA complete inspection of the vehicle\npursuant to the requirements of these regulations must be conducted before\neither a certificate of inspection or an inspection rejection notice is issued. A certified inspector may not begin an inspection or accept a vehicle for\ninspection if the equipment required to perform a complete inspection is\nmissing, broken or not functioning. If an official emissions inspection station\nbegins an inspection and is unable to continue because of failure of the CVIS\nand is unable to create a record in the CVIS of the portion of the inspection\nthat was completed, and the vehicle leaves the premises of the station, then\nupon re-inspection the vehicle must receive a complete inspection. The failed\nattempt shall not constitute an inspection and the customer shall not be\ncharged a fee. (7)\n(i) If the condition of all items required to\nbe inspected are found to comply with the specifications in this Part, then the\ncertified inspector or the inspection station licensee shall affix or issue the\nproper certificate of inspection, with the mileage entered (except for\ntrailers) check the waiver box and punch the trailer box if applicable, and\npunch the expiration date before the vehicle leaves the premises, as follows: (a) all motor vehicles that have a seating\ncapacity, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, under 15\npassengers, all motor vehicles, except trailers and motorcycles, that have a\nMGW, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, under 18,001 pounds, except those motor vehicles that have a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle\nregistration certificate, over 10,000 pounds and under 18,001 pounds, when the\nregistrant requested a heavy vehicle inspection - affix the appropriate safety, safety/emissions, or diesel safety/emissions inspection certificate to the\nlower left inside corner of the windshield to the driver's left of the\nwindshield registration sticker; (b) all motor vehicles that have a seating\ncapacity, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, over 14\npassengers, all motor vehicles, except trailers and motorcycles, that have a\nMGW, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, over 18,000 pounds, those motor vehicles that have a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle registration\ncertificate, over 10,000 pounds and under 18,001 pounds, when the registrant\nrequested a heavy vehicle inspection: (1)\naffix a heavy vehicle safety inspection certificate near the front registration\nplate where it can be seen at all times; (2)\n[Reserved]\n(3)\nif diesel-powered and registered in the\nNYMA, also affix a safety/diesel emissions inspection certificate to the lower\nleft inside corner of the windshield, to the driver's left of the windshield\nregistration sticker; Note: All motor vehicles that have a MGW, as indicated on\nthe vehicle registration certificate, over 18,000 pounds, those motor vehicles\nthat have a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, over\n10,000 pounds and under 18,001 pounds, when the registrant requested a heavy\nvehicle inspection, and all motor vehicles that have a seating capacity, as\nindicated on the vehicle registration certificate, over 14 passengers, registered in the NYMA, and powered by a diesel engine, will be required to\ndisplay BOTH the heavy vehicle inspection certificate and the appropriate\nsafety/diesel emissions inspection certificate. These vehicles registered\noutside the NYMA are exempt from diesel emissions inspection and will be issued\nthe heavy vehicle inspection certificate only, unless the vehicle is presented\nto a diesel emissions and heavy vehicle safety inspection station and the\nappropriate safety and diesel emissions test is requested, and passed. (c) all semitrailers -\naffix a heavy vehicle safety inspection certificate at eye level on the left\n(driver) side, straight out from the king pin on a nonremovable part; (d) all trailers over 18,000 pounds MGW and\nthose trailers over 10,000 pounds MGW for which the registrants requested heavy\nvehicle inspection - affix a heavy vehicle safety inspection certificate on the\nleft (driver) side of the trailer tongue where it can be seen at all\ntimes; (e) trailers 18,000 pounds\nMGW and under except those trailers over 10,000 pounds MGW for which the\nregistrants requested heavy vehicle inspection - issue a safety inspection\ncertificate. If issuing a VS-1082 safety certificate, punch the box marked \"T\"\nand punch the appropriate expiration month. Enter the registration plate number\nin the \"odometer reading\" box on the back of the sticker, or the last 6 digits\nof the VIN if the trailer is not registered, and give the inspection\ncertificate to the trailer owner to be kept with the trailer registration; and\n(f) [Reserved]\n(g) All motorcycle - affix the motorcycle\ninspection certificate to a permanent structural member on the left front side\nof the motorcycle visible when approaching the vehicle from the operator's\nleft. (d) Reinspections. (1)\n\nWhen a vehicle subject to emissions\ninspection is presented to an official emissions inspection station for the\npurpose of reinspection (vehicle was previously rejected within 30 days by the\nsame station or some other station), only the portions (safety or emissions) of\nthe inspection that failed should be reinspected as long as a valid rejection\nnotice or CVIS verification is received, and only the fee for those portions\nactually required to be reinspected may be charged. (2)\n\nWhen a vehicle is presented for the\npurpose of \"safety-only\" reinspection (vehicle was previously rejected within\n30 days by the same station or some other station), a complete and thorough\nsafety inspection must be conducted. (3)\n\nWhen a vehicle subject to the diesel\nemissions inspection is presented for the purpose of re-inspection to the same\nstation within 30 days of the initial rejection, only the portion of the\ninspection (safety or diesel emissions) that was failed shall be\nreinspected. (e) When a\nvehicle subject to the diesel emissions inspection is presented for inspection\nin the NYMA with a valid New York State safety or heavy vehicle safety\ninspection certificate and a temporary certificate of emissions waiver (form\nVS-1078), a complete safety and diesel emissions inspection must be\nperformed. (f) (1)\n\nAll motor vehicles that provide school\ntransportation, regulated passenger transportation (including vehicles commonly\nreferred to as a \"stretch limousine\"), and municipal passenger transportation, as defined in 17 NYCRR section 720.1, are subject to New York State Department\nof Transportation periodic inspection requirements, and, as provided in section\n79.2\n(d)(3)\nof\nthis Part, are exempt from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles\nperiodic inspection requirements.
