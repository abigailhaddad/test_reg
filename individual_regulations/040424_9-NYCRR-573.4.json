  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 573.4 - Subdivisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Subdivisions\nalong land use area boundaries. A subdivision of land solely along a land use\narea boundary does not require an agency permit. (b) Counting lots. For the purpose of\ndetermining agency jurisdiction based on the number of lots created from a\nparcel of land on or after August 1, 1973, any lot to be retained by the\nsubdivider shall be counted. (c) Review of land use or development in subdivisions. All land use or development\nproposed for lots, parcels or sites in a subdivision shall be subject to review\nas part of the subdivision. (d) Subdivision by related persons and persons acting in concert, or as part of a\ncommon plan. A subdivision shall be reviewed with regard to its final planned\nsize regardless of whether different phases are undertaken by (1) different but\nrelated persons or legal entities at different times, such as the development\nof a large subdivision in smaller increments by subsidiaries or affiliates of a\ncorporation, or (2) unrelated persons acting in concert as part of a common\nscheme or plan. (e) Division of\nland by gift, devise or inheritance. (1)\n\nSubject to the other provisions of this section, the mere division of land by\nbona fide gift, devise or inheritance, by and from natural persons is not\nsubject to review by the agency. (2)\n\nEach immediate family member of a person\nwho has continuously owned a landholding since May 22, 1973 may receive one\nparcel from that landholding, provided that the parcel is conveyed by the\nlandowner by bona fide gift, devise or inheritance. In such a case, so as to\nallow the construction of onesingle family dwelling or mobile home on the gift\nlot, the overall intensity guidelines and minimum lot size requirements of the\n\nAdirondack Park Agency Act shall not apply; however, the minimum shoreline lot\nwidth and setback requirements of these regulations shall apply. (3)\nA permit is required for the division of\nland by bona fide gift, devise or inheritance by a person who has not owned the\nland continuously since May 22, 1973, if the resulting lots do not comply with\nthe overall intensity guidelines and minimum lot size criteria of the\n\nAdirondack Park Agency Act and with the minimum shoreline lot width and setback\nrequirements of these regulations. (4)\nA permit is required for the construction\nof a single family dwelling or mobile home on a lot, parcel or site even though\ncreated by gift, devise or inheritance if the lot parcel or site created by\ngift, devise or inheritance is located in a resource management area, industrial use area or critical environmental area. (5)\n\nThe subdivision of a parcel of land owned\nin joint or common tenancy, tenancy by the entirety, or other joint ownership\nbetween or among the owners will not be considered to be by bona fide gift, even if no consideration passes among the parties. Such a subdivision requires\nan agency permit if a class A or class B regional project as provided in\nsection 810 of the Adirondack Park Agency Act. (6)\nA permit is required for the division of\nland through conveyance by gift, devise or inheritance of any lot, parcel or\nsite located outside a hamlet or moderate intensity use area but within a\ndesignated river area. (7)\nA permit\nis required for the division of land through conveyance by gift, devise or\ninheritance of any lot, parcel, or site which is a regulated wetland activity\nas defined in section\n578.3\n(n)(3)\nof\nthis Title. However, a proposed gift lot may not require a permit if the\nrequirements of section\n578.3\n(n)(3)\nof\nthis Title and this section are met. (f) Preexisting subdivisions. (1)\n\nNo agency permit is required for the\nconveyance of a lot or lots in a lawfully preexisting subdivision, provided no\nindividual lot is subdivided. The shoreline building and sewage disposal system\nsetbacks and the vegetative cutting restrictions of section 806 of the\n\nAdirondack Park Agency Act apply to all new land uses or developments on lots\nin preexisting subdivisions; the minimum shoreline lot width requirements apply\nto preexisting subdivisions which have not received Department of Health\napproval. (2)\nA preexisting\nsubdivision is one determined by the agency pursuant to paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision to have been substantially commenced prior to August 1, 1973 and\ninvolving substantial expenditures made for structures or improvements prior to\nsuch date. (3)\n\nLawfully means in\nfull compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, possession of and compliance with any permit or other\napproval required under the Public Health Law, the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw and any local or other governmental regulations. (See also Real Property\n\nLaw and Public Health Law requiring subdivision plats to be filed.)\n(4)\n\nFor the purpose of determining whether a\nsubdivision or portion thereof was in existence as of August 1, 1973, the\nagency will consider, among other relevant factors, (i) the number of lots sold\nprior to such date relative to the total number of lots in the subdivision, (ii) the locations of such lots sold, (iii) the nature, extent and cost of\nstructures and improvements directly related to the subdivision completed or\ncommenced prior to such date, relative to all such necessary improvements\nrelated to the subdivision, (iv) the location of such completed or commenced\nimprovements, and (v) demonstrated efforts to sell lots prior to such\ndate. (5)\n\nThe agency may determine\nthat all or only a portion or portions of a subdivision, or groups of such\nsubdivision lots are preexisting, depending on the pattern of sale of lots and\ninstalled infrastructure. (6)\n\nAn\nagency pennit is required for the construction of a single family dwelling or\nmobile home on a lot in a preexisting subdivision which has not received New\n\nYork State Department of Health approval if located in a resource management or\nindustrial use area, or in a critical environmental area. (g) Merger of lots acquired prior to May 22, 1973. Adjoining lots owned by one landowner, each acquired prior to May 22, 1973, except lots in a preexisting subdivision or separately-owned preexisting\nvacant lots of record as described in section 811(1)(a) of the Adirondack Park\n\nAgency Act, shall be deemed to have merged into one undivided lot as of that\ndate, even if described in different deeds or acquired at various times. A sale\nof any such lot(s) while retaining adjoining land constitutes a subdivision\nwhich requires an agency permit if a class A or class B regional project as\nprovided in section 810 of the act. (h) Preexisting vacant lots of record\nacquired subsequent to May 22, 1973. No agency permit is required for\nthe resale of a preexistings separately-owned vacant lot of record as of May\n22, 1973 as described in section 81 l(l)(a)of the Adirondack Park Agency Act\nwhich is subsequently acquired by an owner of adjoining lands. An agency permit\nis required for any new land use or development on the lot which is a class A\nor class B regional project as provided in section 810 of the Adirondack Park\n\nAgency Act. (i) Boundary line\nadjustments. (1)\nA reconfiguration of the\nboundary between adjoining parcels which were not in common ownership as of May\n22, 1973, making one parcel larger and the other smaller, is a subdivision, but\nwill not require an agency permit provided all the following criteria are met: (i) the land being conveyed as a boundary\nline adjustment must be smaller than 1/4 acre in size and less than 25 feet in\nwidth; and\n(ii)\nthe boundary line\nadjustment parcel must be conveyed to the landowner(s) of the adjoining parcel\n(\"receiving parcel\"), and the boundary line adjustment parcel must be merged\nwith that adjoining parcel by deed covenants stating: (a) this boundary line adjustment parcel\nmerges with the adjoining \"receiving parcel\" and may not be sold separately\nfrom that parcel without a permit from the Adirondack Park Agency; (b) the land being conveyed as a boundary\nline adjustment may not be used by the receiving parcel towards the\nmathematical calculation of the potential for principal buildings under the\n\nAdirondack Park Agency Act; and\n(c) these covenants shall \"run with, touch and concern the land and shall be\nenforceable by the Adirondack Park Agency, the State of New York, and the\ngrantor of the lands which constitute the boundary line adjustment\"; and\n(iii)\na new deed\nmust be executed and delivered for the lands which are the subject of the\nboundary line adjustment, with the convenants cited above. Such deed must be\nrecorded in the Office of the County Clerk within 30 days after the execution\nof the deed. (2)\nA\nreconfiguration of the boundary between adjoining parcels which were not in\ncommon ownership as of May 22, 1973, but which does not meet the criteria\nspecified above, may be approved in advance as a \"boundary line adjustment\" in\nthe discretion of agency staff if the boundary line adjustment lands are of a\nsize, nature and configuration which could not reasonably accommodate the\nconstruction of a principal building. Subparagraphs (l)(ii) and (iii) of this\nsubdivision will still apply. (3)\n\nThe boundaries between two adjoining parcels which are the subject of an agency\npermit, order or settlement agreement, or which are considered lots in a\npreexisting subdivision, may not be altered by a conveyance of land between\nthem as a \"boundary line adjustment\" unless authorized by a new or amended\nagency permit, order or settlement agreement. (4)\n\nAdjoining parcels which were in common\nownership as of May 22, 1973 are treated as one merged parcel pursuant to\nsection 811(1)(a) of the Adirondack Park Agencv Act. A reconfiguration of the\nboundaries of such parcels is a subdivision, and will require an agency permit\npursuant to the terms of section 810 of the Adirondack Park Agencv\n\nAct. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
