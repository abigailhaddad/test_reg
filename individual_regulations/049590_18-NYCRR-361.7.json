  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 361.7 - Initial contacts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Method. Case management staff must\ncontact each referred adolescent who potentially is eligible for case\nmanagement activities in order to arrange an initial interview and needs\nassessment. The initial contact may be made by letter, telephone or personal\nvisit. (b) Scheduling the initial\ninterview. The initial interview and assessment must occur within 30 calendar\ndays from the date the adolescent is referred to case management staff for case\nmanagement activities. Case management staff must make reasonable attempts to\nschedule the initial interview at a place and time convenient to the\nadolescent, taking into consideration that the adolescent's access to\ntransportation and child care may be limited. (c) Confirming the initial interview. Regardless of how the initial contact was made, the case manager must provide\nthe adolescent with a written confirmation of the initial interview within a\nreasonable amount of time prior to the interview date so that the adolescent\nhas sufficient notice of the scheduled interview. The confirmation must include\ninformation regarding: the purpose, time, date and location of the initial\ninterview; the voluntary nature of the activities; any arrangements made for\nnecessary child care and transportation; and the name and telephone number of\nthe individual the adolescent should contact regarding any questions about the\ncase management activities, any assistance needed in making child care or\ntransportation arrangements, or rescheduling the interview. (d) Recontact. Case management staff must\nrecontact an adolescent who fails to respond to the initial contact, or who is\nunavailable for the initial interview, for the purpose of rescheduling the\ninitial interview so the interview will occur within 30 calendar days from the\ndate the adolescent was referred to case management staff for case management\nactivities or as soon thereafter as possible. (e) Refusal to participate. If the\nadolescent, without explanation or cause, again fails to contact the case\nmanager or is unavailable for the rescheduled interview, then the case manager\nmay, but is not mandated to, consider such failure as a refusal by the\nadolescent to participate in case management activities. (f) Record of referred cases. Case management\nstaff must maintain a log or other record containing information about the\nadolescents referred for case management activities. The social services\ndistrict may use a format for this record which best meets the district's\npurposes. The record must include, but need not be limited to: the name of the\nreferred adolescent; identifying information about the adolescent, such as his\nor her client identification number, public assistance case number, social\nsecurity number and date of birth; the source and date of the referral to case\nmanagement staff for case management activities; the method and date of the\ninitial contact to arrange an initial interview and needs assessment; and the\nreferral's disposition, including, as appropriate, whether the case was opened\nor the reasons for determining the adolescent was ineligible for case\nmanagement activities or the reasons the adolescent gave for refusing to\nparticipate in such activities.
