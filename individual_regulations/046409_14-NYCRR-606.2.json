  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 606.2 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chapter 941 of\nthe Laws of 1984 permits State agencies to file with the Secretary of State\ncodes, rules and regulations that were previously incorporated by reference in\nthe agency's codes, rules and regulations, but not filed with the Secretary of\n\nState. (b) Prior to the amendment\nof section\n102\nof the\n\nExecutive Law by chapter 941, there was a requirement that the Secretary of\n\nState must publish every code, rule and regulation in the\n\nOfficial\n\nCompilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York\n(NYCRR). (c) As amended, section\n102\nof the\n\nExecutive Law now exempts certain codes, rules or regulations from publication\nin the NYCRR, if the code, rule or regulation has been otherwise published by\nthe Federal government or by a private publisher. (d) Chapter 941 requires that exempt\npublications must be made available for public use and inspection at the New\n\nYork State Department of State. Hence, because it will be the duty of the\n\nSecretary of State to maintain a master compilation of all codes, rules and\nregulations including those Federal and private publications that will not be\nprinted in NYCRR and because it will be the duty of the Secretary of State to\nmaintain historical files containing the official text of such documents, it is\nnecessary that all referenced codes, rules and regulations be prepared and\nsubmitted for filing in a manner that will ensure that the text of each\ndocument is identifiable and available to the public. (e) It is understood that many of the\nreferenced documents in question have to do with codes, rules and regulations\nthat have been adopted to protect the public health, safety and\nwelfare. (f) Since the\nenforceability of those codes, rules or regulations may depend on evidence that\nthe material was available and is actually filed with the Secretary of State, it is essential that the text of such documents be identifiable and retrievable\nfrom the files of the Department of State. (g) To ensure the provisions of chapter 941\nof the Laws of 1984 are met, the Department of State has set forth rules in 19\nNYCRR\n261.2. (h) This Part, established pursuant to section 2 of chapter 941 of the Laws of 1984, and in\naccordance with section\n261.2\nof 19 NYCRR\n261\nsets forth a\ncomprehensive listing of incorporation by reference codes, rules and\nregulations, and all other referenced published data, criteria, standards, specifications, techniques, illustrations or information which are contained in\nthis Title and are applicable to facilities certified and/or operated by the\nOPWDD.
