  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 188.18 - Duplicating original records on microfilm\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Negative microphotographic film. When a\nmicroform will replace an original record having a legal minimum retention\nperiod of 10 years or longer and when the agency still must maintain it for at\nleast 10 years to meet this requirement, or when the records being\nmicrophotographed are identified on a records retention and disposition\nschedule as having a permanent or archival retention period, only a\npolyester-based, black-and-white silver gelatin microform or Ilfochrome\n(formerly known as Cibachrome) color microform shall be used as the original\ncamera negative film. (b) Preservation of the camera negative. When a microform will replace an original\nrecord, the camera negative shall be used only to produce duplicate copies of\nthe film. Once the duplicates have been made, the camera negative film must be\nplaced in an offsite storage facility that meets standards established by the\ndirector for security, fire protection and environmental control to ensure the\npreservation of the information on the microform. (c) Microforms to meet quality standards. When a microform will replace an original record, the microform shall meet\nquality standards established by the director for resolution and density to\nensure that the film and copies made from it will be clear and legible and to\nensure the long-term viability of the film. (d) Targeting and certification of\nmicroforms. When a microform will replace an original record, the following\nmeasures must be taken to ensure access to the information contained on the\nmicroform, and the quality and legal admissibility of the microform itself: (1)\n\nThe records to be filmed shall be\narranged and identified to ensure reasonable access to individual\ndocuments. (2)\n\nEach discrete roll\nof original negative film and each discrete original negative fiche shall begin\nwith a target identifying the records being filmed and certifying that the\nrecords are being filmed in the normal course of business. Each shall end with\na signed declaration by the camera operator identifying the date of filming and\nthe agency for which the film is being produced. (3)\n\nIn addition, each roll of film must have\nthe following targets at the beginning of the roll: density target, resolution\ntarget and start target. (4)\n\nIn\naddition, each roll of film shall have an end target at the end of each\nroll. (5)\n\nWhere needed, roll film\nshall contain retake and correction targets. (e) Inspection of microforms. A\nrepresentative sample of all microforms shall be quality inspected to ensure\nthat the film images meet quality standards set by the director. Each batch of\nprocessed film shall be tested to ensure that processing chemicals which could\ncause image deterioration are washed from the film. Film and film images that\ndo not meet standards must be reshot before the original document may be\ndestroyed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
