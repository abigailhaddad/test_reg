  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.12 - Contractors ledger\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll transactions in connection with numbered contracts\nduring the development period (see the definition of account 1460, Structures, Equipment and Improvements, in Part 1641) shall be recorded in a contractors\nledger. A separate sheet shall be set up for each contract awarded. The\ncontractors ledger is subsidiary to and shall be controlled by account 2400, Contract Awards, account 1500, Incompleted Contracts, and account 2112, Contract Retentions, in the general ledger. The specimen form of contractors\nledger is shown as Exhibit 19 of Appendix S-8. Generally available stock forms\nshould be adapted by the local agency for the contractors ledger, with or\nwithout overprinting. A monthly trial balance of the contractors ledger shall\nbe taken and the balances therein shall at all times agree with the general\nledger controls. Postings to the contractors ledger usually originate from\njournal and accounts payable vouchers. The balanced contractors ledger is the\nsource of all the information required for the schedule of contract awards\nrequired to be submitted with the periodic reports to the division. The\ninformation for the contractors ledger as to the contract payment for advances\nfor materials stored is obtained from line 16 of the periodical estimate for\npartial payment (see Exhibit 14, Appendix S-11). Each periodical estimate will\nhave the current figure shown on this line, until by the end of construction, the amount should be zero. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
