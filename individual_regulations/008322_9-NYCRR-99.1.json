  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 99.1 - Declaration\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The authority\nrecognizes that responsible advertising of alcoholic beverages by licensees\nconstitutes a proper medium of information to the general public. Advertising\nwhich is deceptive or misleading to the consumer or general public is contrary\nto the public interest and is not conducive to the proper regulation and\ncontrol of the traffic in alcoholic beverages. (1)\n\nAdvertisements of any kind which tend to\npromote the belief that groups of package stores are being operated as a liquor\nstore chain or are jointly owned or operated are misleading and\ndeceptive. (2)\n\nIt is the considered\njudgment of the authority that, in the absence of appropriate notification to\nthe public, joint or group advertisements listing the names and addresses of\nmultiple licensees and containing a common symbol or name, and related\npractices involving the use of such common symbol or name, may (i) create the\nimpression that the licensees are a chain enterprise or are jointly owned, operated or controlled, (ii) tend to deceive the consumer, and (iii) constitute\nmisleading and deceptive advertising and offering of alcoholic\nbeverages. (b) Advertisements that certain products are on sale or represent special values\ntend also to be misleading or deceptive, particularly in light of statutory\nprovisions which prohibit the sale of liquor and wine below legally established\nprices. Advertisements purporting to set forth the suggested retail price or\nlist price, or the true or actual value of a product, similarly tend to mislead\nor deceive the consumer, particularly insofar as they may create an impression\nthat a product is on sale at a new low price when in fact the price has not\nbeen reduced by the licensee. (c) To eliminate such deceptive or misleading advertising and related practices, which contravene the provisions, intent and purpose of the Alcoholic Beverage\n\nControl Law and the policy of this State, and which deceive or tend to deceive\nthe consumer and general public, the authority has adopted this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n99.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
