  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-2.6 - Emission reduction credits (ercs)\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section represents the required provisions and\ncriteria for certification, registration, and use of emission reductions as\nERCs for all emission units (including those that are not subject to Part 201\nof this Title), and for mobile sources and demand side management (DSM). Unless\notherwise specified, the term ERC in this section refers to past reductions as\ndefined in section\n231-2.1\nof this Subpart. (a) Certification of emission reductions. (1)\n\nCertification basis. Emission reductions\nmust be certified as ERCs on an emission unit basis. (2)\n\nCertification deadlines. Applicants are\nencouraged to apply for ERCs soon after the occurrence of the emission\nreductions, although there are no time restrictions for submittal of ERC\napplications. The department may deny ERCs if sufficient supporting\ndocumentation is not submitted as required by paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\nERC creation\nmechanisms. ERCs may be created from past or future reductions resulting from\nfacility shutdown, emission unit shutdown, curtailment, source reduction, over-control of emissions beyond an applicable limit or any other reduction\nmechanism acceptable to the department. (4)\n\nFuture reductions. Future reductions\nshall not be certified if they are not linked to a proposed major facility or\nproposed source project through enforceable permit conditions. Any certified\nfuture reduction shall become invalid if the applicant abandons the proposed\nmajor facility or proposed source project linked to the reduction prior to\ncommencement of operation. (5)\n\nApplication for ERC certification. The applicant must submit an air permit\napplication requesting a minor permit modification (as defined in Part 201 of\nthis Title) for certification of an emission reduction. Such an application\nmust include the following: (i) a notarized\nletter indicating the name and title of the person authorized to act on the\ncompany's behalf for certification/transfer of ERCs. Subsequent to the permit\nmodification, an ERC certificate will be issued to the authorized\nrepresentative for the company; (ii)\na complete Emission Reduction Credit\n\nQuantification Form with supporting documentation establishing that the\nemission reduction is surplus, quantifiable, permanent and enforceable. The\nabove-mentioned ERC criteria are described below: (a) surplus. The applicant must ensure that\nthe emission reduction for an emission unit is in excess of any reduction\nrequired by RACT or MACT or any other regulations applicable to the emission\nunit during the baseline period for the emission reduction. The determination\nof \"surplus\" is as follows: (1)\nfor an\nemission reduction which physically occurred prior to the State or Federal\n\nRegister publication date proposing RACT or MACT requirements, the applicant is\neligible for the full amount of the reduction. Otherwise, the applicant is\neligible only for the lesser of the prior actual annual emissions or prior\nallowable annual emissions reflecting RACT or MACT emission limits; (2)\nfor a future reduction as defined in\nsection\n231-2.1\nof this Subpart, if the\ndate of certification of the ERC is prior to the State or Federal Register\npublication date proposing RACT or MACT requirements, then the applicant is\neligible for the full amount of the reduction. Otherwise, the applicant is\neligible only for the lesser of the prior actual annual emissions or prior\nallowable annual emissions reflecting RACT or MACT emission limits; (b) quantifiable. The applicant\nmust use a reliable basis for quantifying the reduction. Continuous emissions\nmonitoring data, stack test data, emission statements, EPA's AP-42 data, fuel\nand solvent purchase records are acceptable bases for quantifying emission\nreductions; (c) permanent. The\napplicant must ensure that all reductions are permanent as defined in section\n231-2.1\nof this Subpart; and\n(d) enforceable. For any ERC to\nbe enforceable, the permit modification establishing the ERC must be noticed in\nthe Environmental Notice Bulletin and a local newspaper for a 30-day public\ncomment period. (6)\n\nRetention of ERCs by the department. (i) For VOC or NO\nx\nERCs (except those meeting the criteria listed in subparagraph [ii] of this\nparagraph) generated from facility or emission unit shutdowns in a moderate or\nsevere ozone nonattainment area, 25 percent of such ERCs shall be retained by\nthe department and may be used in support of the New York SIP to demonstrate\nreasonable further progress towards attaining and maintaining the national\nambient air quality standard for ozone. (ii)\n\nAn ERC is exempt from retention by the\ndepartment provided it: (a) is used at the\nsame facility as part of a net emission increase determination of\nnonapplicability, an internal offset, or as an emission offset; or\n(b) occurs at a nonmajor facility. (7)\n\nCertification\nissuance. Upon approval of an ERC application, the department will issue ERC\ncertification as follows: (i) Reduction from\nan emission unit subject to Part 201 of this Title located at a facility\nsubject to a State or title V permit (Subparts 201-5 and 201-6 of this Title). For such a reduction resulting from: (a) over-control of emissions beyond an applicable limit; (b) emission unit shutdown; (c) curtailment; or\n(d) source reduction. A permit modification with federally enforceable special\nconditions representing the emission unit will be issued. (ii)\n\nReduction from the shutdown\nof an emission unit subject to Part 201 of this Title located at a facility\nsubject to registration (Subpart 201-4 of this Title). Such a reduction shall\nbe made federally enforceable if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction\nof the department that the emission unit has been physically removed or\nrendered inoperable. (iii)\n\nReduction from the shutdown of a facility subject to Part 201 of this Title. Such a reduction shall be made federally enforceable if the applicant\nsurrenders the title V permit, State facility permit, or registration\ncertificate as appropriate. (iv)\n\nReduction from an emission unit not subject to Part 201 of this Title. Such a\nreduction shall be made federally enforceable by requiring the applicant to\nsubmit a single source SIP revision for department and EPA approval. Upon such\napprovals, the department will issue a SIP revision approval letter along with\nappropriate enforceable conditions. (v) Certificate issuance. (a) For past reductions (see section\n231-2.1\nof this Subpart) listed in\nsubparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, a certificate establishing\nthe amount of the ERCs for each nonattainment contaminant will be issued\nsubsequent to the issuance of the permit modification or SIP revision approval\nletter, as appropriate. (b) For\nfuture reductions (see section\n231-2.1\nof this Subpart), the\npermit for the emission unit creating the ERCs would be modified. No\ncertificates will be issued for future reductions. (vi)\n\nCertification date. The date of\ncertification of an emission reduction as an ERC shall be the date of issuance\nof a certificate establishing the ERCs. (8)\n\nCertification disapproval. If the\ndepartment determines that the emission reduction cannot be certified, the\napplicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for such\ndetermination. (9)\n\nIssuance of\ncertificates for ERCs which have been previously certified through permit\nmodifications. A certificate establishing the amount of ERCs will be issued by\nthe department to the owner of any available ERCs listed in the New York State\nERC Registry. (10)\n\nMobile source\nand demand side management ERCs. Applications for mobile sources and demand\nside management ERCs will be approved by the department on a case-by-case basis\nupon submittal of acceptable protocols. A single source SIP revision must be\nsubmitted by the department to EPA for approval to make the ERC federally\nenforceable. A certificate establishing the amount of the ERCs will be issued\nalong with the SIP revision approval letter. (b) Registration. All certified emission\nreductions shall be entered into a listing of available ERCs (Registry)\nmaintained by the department. This listing may be obtained from the department\nupon request. (c) Transfer of ERCs. For transfer of ERCs, the authorized representatives of the transferor (seller)\nand transferee (buyer) companies shall sign and date the reverse side of the\nERC certificate. Both signatures must be notarized. After completing the\nreverse side of the ERC certificate, the transferor shall send the certificate\nto the department (address provided on the certificate). Subsequent to the\nreceipt of this certificate, the department will issue certificates to the\ntransferor and transferee reflecting the transfer. (d) Use of ERCs. (1)\n\nAn ERC may be used in a net emission\nincrease determination or as an internal offset or an emission\noffset. (2)\n\nAn ERC may be used as\nan offset without time limit or restriction, within New York State or in\nanother state in the ozone transport region if New York has established a\nreciprocal trading agreement with that state. (3)\n\nAn ERC shall be of the same class of\nnonattainment contaminant as the emission increase requiring ERCs. For example, only a particulate form of emission shall be used as an offset for new\nparticulate emissions, only CO shall be used as an offset for new CO emissions, and so on. (4)\n\nAn ERC may include\nemission reductions from control or elimination of fugitive emissions, provided\nthese emissions are contained in the New York State emissions\ninventory. (5)\n\nAn ERC may include\nincidental emission reductions which the department has not relied upon in\nissuing any permit under a federally approved SIP or delegated Federal\nregulation. (6)\n\nAn ERC, or portion\nthereof, which was used in a net emission increase determination of\nnonapplicability or as an internal offset or an emission offset shall not\nsubsequently be used for demonstrating attainment with ambient air quality\nstandards or reasonable further progress in a federally-approved SIP. (7)\n\nAn ERC, or portion thereof, which was\nused in a net emission increase determination of nonapplicability shall not\nsubsequently be used for internal offset or emission offset purposes, but may\nbe used in a subsequent net emission increase determination, if\ncontemporaneous. (8)\n\nAn ERC, or\nportion thereof, which was used as an internal offset or an emission offset\nshall not be used again for any purpose. (e) ERCs for replacement and relocation of\nemission sources. (1)\nERCs for the replacement\nof an emission source with new similar equipment (connected to the existing\nstack or a new stack) shall be quantified as follows: (i) the difference between the lower of the\nprior actual annual emissions or prior allowable annual emissions of the\nemission unit representing the old emission source; and\n(ii)\nthe future potential of the emission\nunit representing the new emission source. (2)\n\nThe relocation of an emission source\nwithin the same facility would neither qualify for ERCs for the shutdown of the\nemission source nor be subject to this Subpart at the new location. However, such a relocation must comply with all other applicable Parts of this Title and\nresult in acceptable air quality impacts pursuant to section\n200.6\nof this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-2.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
