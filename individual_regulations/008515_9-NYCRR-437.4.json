  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 437.4 - Funding\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The State share\nof the cost of a municipal park project shall not exceed 50 percent of the\napproved project cost, less any Federal assistance or any other State\nassistance received or to be received for the project. (b) The cost of a project, for determining\nthe State share, shall include engineering and architectural services, plans\nand specifications, consultant and legal services, and other direct expenses\nincidental to such project. (c) Payment of the State funds for a project shall be on a reimbursement basis\nonly. The municipality shall submit periodic billings for reimbursement of the\n\nState share as work is performed and costs incurred. (d) Municipal share of cost. (1)\n\nThe municipal share of the cost of a\nproject may consist of funds or the value of services, materials, equipment or\nreal property provided by the municipality or donated to the municipality for\nthe particular project which is the subject of the State grant. The sources and\namounts of the municipal share shall have the prior approval of the\ncommissioner. (2)\n\nReal property may\nbe property purchased by or donated to the municipality for the particular park\nproject which is the subject of the grant, or may be property already owned by\nthe municipality which has not been previously operated for park purposes. The\nvalue of real property will be the fair market value as established by\nappraisal in accordance with the requirements of the office. (e) Waivers of retroactivity. To\nbe eligible for reimbursement as part of the State grant, or for approval as\npart of the municipal share, all services, materials and equipment must be\nprovided during the term of the grant. An exception will be made only when an\nimmediate action on a project is necessary and the time required to process an\napplication would result in an opportunity being lost. Credit for work\nperformed prior to the approval of an application will be granted according to\nthe following conditions: (1)\n\nWaivers of\nretroactivity will be granted only for acquisition projects or for the\nacquisition of real property whose value may be used as all or part of the\nmunicipal share of the cost of the project. (2)\n\nThe municipality shall notify the office\nin writing of the necessity for a waiver of retroactivity and provide such\ninformation about the proposed action, including environmental data, as is\nrequested by the office. (3)\n\nIf the\noffice grants a waiver, the retroactive costs will be eligible for assistance\nor use as a match only if the project is subsequently approved. The retroactive\ncosts are incurred at the municipality's risk, since the granting of a waiver\nby the office is only an acknowledgment of the need for immediate action; it\ndoes not insure that the project will be approved. (4)\n\nIn order for retroactive costs to be\neligible for assistance or use as a match, the municipality must submit a\npreliminary application for the project in the grant cycle following the one in\nwhich the waiver is granted. (5)\nA\nfinding by the office that the activity for which a retroactive waiver is\nsought will have a significant adverse environmental effect may preclude the\ngranting of such waiver. (f) The cost of a project, for determining\nthe State share, shall not exceed the amount set forth in the application as\napproved by the commissioner. The State shall not be responsible for any\nincreases in the cost of the project after the date of the commissioner's\napproval. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
