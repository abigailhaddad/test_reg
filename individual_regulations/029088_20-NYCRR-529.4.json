  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 529.4 - United Nations or other international organizations\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1116(a)(3)\n(a) As purchaser. (1)\n\nThe United Nations or any other\ninternational organization of which the United States of America is a member\n(hereinafter referred to as international organizations) is not subject to the\nsales tax when it is the purchaser, consumer or user of tangible personal\nproperty or services or when it is the occupant of hotel rooms or a patron at a\nplace of amusement, club, roof garden, cabaret or similar place. (2)\n(i) In\norder to obtain exemption from the sales or use tax, international\norganizations are required to submit a request for the exemption on the\nletterhead of the organization, stating the basis for its claimed exemption\nfrom tax. The request must be signed by a responsible officer of the\norganization and sent to the Department of Taxation and Finance, Taxpayer\n\nAssistance Bureau, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. (ii)\n\nIn addition to the information\nspecifically requested by this section, the department may require any\nadditional information deemed necessary for a proper determination of whether\nan organization is exempt and may prescribe the form in which the proof of\nexemption will be furnished. (iii)\n\nUpon approval of the application, the Taxpayer Assistance Bureau will issue to\neach qualifying international organization a numbered exempt organization\ncertificate. Cross-reference: For applicable general regulations, including denials and\nrevocations, see subdivision (j) of section\n529.1\nof this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nAn\ninternational organization, to exercise its right to exemption from the sales\ntax, must be the direct purchaser, occupant or patron of record and the direct\npayer of record. Direct purchaser, occupant or patron\nas used\nin this paragraph includes any agent or employee authorized by the organization\nto act on its behalf in making such purchases, provided the organization and\nits agent are both identified on any bill or invoice. An international\norganization is the direct payer of record where payment is made by the\norganization or from its funds directly to the vendor. When making purchases, the organization is required to furnish its vendors with a properly completed\nexempt organization certification. (4)\n\nAn exempt organization certification is\nproperly completed when it contains the: (i) name and address of the vendor; (ii)\nname and address of the international\norganization; (iii)\nnumber assigned\nto the exempt organization certificate; (iv)\nsignature of a responsible officer of\nthe international organization; and\n(v) date the certification was\nissued. (b) As vendor. (1)\n\nSales by\ninternational organizations of tangible personal property or services are\nsubject to tax when they are of a kind ordinarily sold by private persons. When\nsales by international organizations are of a kind not ordinarily sold by\nprivate persons, such sales are not subject to tax. (2)\n\nHowever, sales by the United Nations or\nits agencies within the United Nations headquarters district are not subject to\ntax in view of the provisions of the charter of the United Nations, the\n\nInternational Organizations Immunities Act and the agreement between the United\n\nStates and the United Nations approved by joint resolution of Congress of\n\nAugust 4, 1947. (3)\n\nFailure by an\ninternational organization to collect tax on transactions which are subject to\ntax does not relieve the purchaser from his liability to pay the tax due. The\ntax due and not collected by the international organization must be paid by the\npurchaser directly to the Department of Taxation and Finance. See Part 532 of\nthis Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
