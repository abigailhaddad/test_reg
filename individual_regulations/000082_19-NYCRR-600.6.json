Tit. 19 § 600.6 - Long Island Sound coastal policies\n\nState Regulations\n\nReference should be made to the Long Island Sound Coastal\n\nManagement Program, particularly chapter four thereof, for information and\nguidance in determining whether an action in the Long Island Sound coastal area\nis consistent with the following policies. (a) Foster a pattern of development in the\n\nLong Island Sound coastal area that enhances community character, preserves\nopen space, makes efficient use of infrastructure, makes beneficial use of a\ncoastal location, and minimizes adverse effects of development. (1)\n\nConcentrate development and redevelopment\nin or adjacent to traditional waterfront communities. (i) Maintain traditional waterfront\ncommunities and ensure that development within these communities supports and\nis compatible with the character of the community. (ii)\n\nFocus public investment, actions, and\nassistance in waterfront redevelopment areas to reclaim unused waterfront land\nand brownfields for new purposes.

(2)\n\nEnsure\nthat development or uses take appropriate advantage of their coastal location. (i) Reserve coastal waters for\nwater-dependent uses and activities. (ii)\n\nAccommodate water-enhanced uses along\nthe sound waterfront where they are compatible with surrounding development, do\nnot displace or interfere with water-dependent uses, and reflect the unique\nqualities of a coastal location through appropriate design and\norientation. (iii)\n\nAllow other uses\nthat derive benefit from a waterfront location, such as residential uses, in\nappropriate locations.

(iii)\n\nPromote activities and market\nconditions that would likely prevent conversion of farmlands to other land\nuses. (3)\n\nMinimize\nadverse impacts on agriculture from unavoidable conversion of agricultural\nland. (i) Minimize encroachment of\ncommercial, industrial, institutional, or residential development on\nagricultural lands. (ii)\n\nRetain or\nincorporate opportunities for continuing agricultural use. (iii)\n\nLocate and arrange development to\nmaximize protection of the highest quality agricultural land in large\ncontiguous tracts for efficient farming\n(4)\n\nPreserve scenic and open space values\nassociated with the sound's agricultural lands. (i) Locate and arrange development to\nmaximize protection of agricultural land in large contiguous tracts to protect\nassociated scenic and open space values. (ii)\n\nAllow farms to operate using appropriate\nmodern techniques and structures without consideration of scenic\nvalues. (m) Promote appropriate use and development of energy and mineral resources. (1)\n\nConserve energy resources. (i) Promote and maintain energy efficient\nmodes of transportation, including rail freight and intermodal facilities, waterborne cargo and passenger transportation, mass transit, and alternative\nforms of transportation. (ii)\n\nPlan\nand construct sites using energy efficient design. (iii)\n\nCapture heat waste from industrial\nprocesses for heating and electric generation. (iv)\n\nImprove energy generating efficiency\nthrough design upgrades of existing facilities. (2)\n\nPromote alternative energy sources that\nare self-sustaining, including solar and wind powered energy generation. (i) In siting such facilities, avoid\ninterference with coastal resources, including migratory birds, and coastal\nprocesses. (3)\n\nEnsure\nmaximum efficiency and minimum adverse environmental impact when siting major\nenergy generating facilities. (i) Site major\nenergy generating facilities in a coastal location where a clear public benefit\nis established. (ii)\n\nSite major\nenergy generating facilities close to load centers to achieve maximum\ntransmission efficiency. (iii)\n\nSite\nand construct new energy generating and transmission facilities so they do not\nadversely affect natural and economic coastal resources. (4)\n\nMinimize adverse impacts from fuel\nstorage facilities. (i) Regional petroleum\nreserve facilities are inappropriate in the Long Island Sound coastal\narea. (ii)\n\nThe production, storage, or retention of petroleum products in earthen reservoirs is\nprohibited. (iii)\n\nLiquified natural\ngas facilities must be safely sited and operated. (iv)\n\nProtect natural resources by preparing\nand complying with an approved oil spill contingency plan. (5)\n\nMinimize adverse impacts associated with\nmineral extraction. (i) Commercial sand and\naggregate mining is generally presumed to be an inappropriate use in the Long\n\nIsland Sound coastal area. (ii)\n\nPreserve and overburden using appropriate site preparation techniques and\nsubsequent site reclamation plans. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
