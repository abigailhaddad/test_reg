  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 226.0 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Beginning in 2011, the department conducted an investigation into how life insurance companies and fraternal benefit societies track life insurance policyholders. The department's investigation found that many insurers had been regularly using lists of recent deaths from the Social Security Administration to promptly cease making annuity payments. However, most insurers had not been using the lists to determine whether death benefits were payable to beneficiaries. (b) The public needs to know that insurers are taking reasonable steps to ensure that policyowners and policy beneficiaries are provided with all of the life insurance benefits for which they have paid and to which they are entitled. In particular, there may be instances where a death has occurred and no claim has been filed, but premiums continue to be deducted from the existing policy values until the policy lapses. In other instances, the policies or accounts may simply remain dormant after death. In these instances, a valid death benefit is either not paid or distributed or is delayed. (c) To ensure that policyowners and policy beneficiaries are provided with all of the benefits for which they have paid and to which they are entitled, this Part was promulgated on an emergency basis. Subsequently, the Legislature enacted Insurance Law section 3212-a, which was renumbered as section 3240, to address the issues that the department had observed. (d) This Part requires insurers to implement reasonable procedures to identify unclaimed death benefits, locate beneficiaries, and make prompt payments. In addition, to further ensure payment of unclaimed benefits, this Part requires insurers to respond to requests from the superintendent to search for policies insuring the life of, or owned by, decedents and to initiate the claims process for any death benefits that are identified as a result of those requests.
