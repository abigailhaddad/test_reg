Tit. 6 § 622.8 - The pre-hearing conference\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\npre-hearing conference must be held when notice thereof, including the date, time and location, is provided in the notice of hearing. A pre-hearing\nconference will not be held when a proceeding is commenced by motion for an\norder without hearing in lieu of complaint. In any situation where provisional\nrelief is imposed prior to the opportunity for a hearing or where respondent is\nentitled by law or regulation to a hearing within a stated period of time, a\npre-hearing conference may only be held with the consent of\nrespondent. (b) The purpose of the\npre-hearing conference is to resolve, define and clarify issues between the\nparties prior to the hearing. The parties may request that the matter be\nmediated pursuant to section\n622.19\nof this Part. No stenographic\ntranscriptions or recordings of the conference will be made. (c) Department staff and respondent must\nattend the pre-hearing conference. If an ALJ is not present at the pre-hearing\nconference, the parties may consult by conference call or in person with the\n\nOffice of Hearings and Mediation Services. Attendance at the conference is\nmandatory, and failure to attend the pre-hearing conference constitutes a\ndefault and a waiver of the opportunity for a hearing if, at the time of the\nconference, respondent's time to answer has expired.
