  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 120.4 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 620(c)\n\nThe following definitions apply for purposes of sections\n120.1\n-120.3 of this Part: (a) Total\n\nNew York income. (1)\n\nIn the case of a\nresident individual, the term\ntotal New York income\nmeans New\n\nYork adjusted gross income as determined under section\n612\nof the Tax Law. (2)\n\nIn the case of a resident estate or\ntrust, the term\ntotal New York income\nmeans the amount of its\nincome determined as if the estate or trust were a resident individual\ncomputing New York adjusted gross income under section\n612\nof the Tax Law. (b) New York State tax payable. The term\n\nNew York State tax payable\nmeans the ordinary tax (see section\n101.1\nof this Title), less any household credit permitted under section\n606 (b)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. The term\n\nNew York State tax payable, for\npurposes of this Part, does not include any amounts representing interest or\npenalties. (c) The term\nincome tax imposed by the other jurisdiction\nmeans the total\nincome tax payable thereto for the taxable year, exclusive of the portion of\nsuch tax (determined in accordance with the provisions of section\n120.6\n[b]\nof this Part) which is imposed on the ordinary income portion (or part thereof)\nof a lump sum distribution, and any interest or penalties. No resident credit\nis allowable if no tax is actually due to the other jurisdiction. Further, no\ncredit is allowable if another jurisdiction provides for an exemption from its\ntax on account of the New York State personal income tax of a New York State\nresident, since the tax imposed by the other jurisdiction is the amount payable\nafter giving effect to such exemption and the credit is reduced if such other\njurisdiction provides for a reduction of its tax on such amount. (d) The term\nincome derived from\nsources within\nanother state, a political subdivision of another\nstate, the District of Columbia, or a province of Canada, is construed so as to\naccord with the definition of the term\nderived from or connected with\n\nNew York State sources, as set forth in section\n631\nof the Tax Law in relation to the New\n\nYork source income of a nonresident individual. Thus, the resident credit\nagainst ordinary tax is allowable for income tax imposed by another\njurisdiction upon compensation for personal services performed in the other\njurisdiction, income from a business, trade or profession carried on in the\nother jurisdiction, and income from real or tangible personal property situated\nin the other jurisdiction. Conversely, the resident credit is not allowed for\ntax imposed by another jurisdiction upon income from intangibles, except where\nsuch income is from property employed in a business, trade or profession\ncarried on in the other jurisdiction. Thus, for example, no resident credit is\nallowable for an income tax of another jurisdiction on dividend income not\nderived from property employed in a business, trade or profession carried on in\nsuch jurisdiction.
