  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 368-3.6 - Manufacturer credits and surcharges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Electronic waste acceptance credits. If a\nmanufacturer accepts more electronic waste than its acceptance standard for the\ncalendar year, then the excess weight may be used as electronic waste\nacceptance credits and may be sold, traded, or banked for up to three calendar\nyears following the year in which the credits were earned. (1)\n\nEach pound of excess electronic waste\ncollected will be equivalent to one credit. Fractions of pounds will be rounded\nto the nearest whole number. (2)\n\nCredit transactions must be reported to the department in the manufacturer's\nannual report. (3)\nA credit must\nnot be used, purchased, or sold to satisfy an acceptance standard in the same\ncalendar year in which the credit was generated. (4)\n\nNo more than 25 percent of a\nmanufacturer's acceptance standard for any calendar year may be satisfied with\ncredits generated in any prior calendar year. (5)\nA credit purchased by a manufacturer in a\ncalendar year must be applied to that calendar year's acceptance standard and\nmust not be used to meet subsequent years' obligations. (6)\nA credit may only be used to meet a\nshortfall in electronic waste acceptance and must not be applied in excess of a\nmanufacturer's acceptance standard. (b) Recycling surcharge. A manufacturer that\nfails to meet its acceptance standard for the previous calendar year as\nrequired by section\n368-3.3\nof this Subpart, is subject\nto a recycling surcharge. (1)\n\nThe recycling\nsurcharge will be determined by the department as follows: (i) If a manufacturer accepts at least 90\npercent but less than 100 percent of its acceptance standard, the surcharge is\n30 cents multiplied by the number of additional pounds of electronic waste that\nshould have been accepted by the manufacturer. (ii)\n\nIf a manufacturer accepts at least 50\npercent but less than 90 percent of its acceptance standard, the surcharge is\n40 cents multiplied by the number of additional pounds of electronic waste that\nshould have been accepted by the manufacturer. (iii)\n\nIf a manufacturer accepts less than 50\npercent of its acceptance standard, the surcharge is 50 cents multiplied by the\nnumber of additional pounds of electronic waste that should have been accepted\nby the manufacturer. (2)\n\nThe department will invoice a manufacturer for any surcharge owed. Payment is\ndue within 30 days of the date of the invoice. (3)\n\nThe department may waive a recycling\nsurcharge if the manufacturer demonstrates it used its best efforts to comply\nbut was unable to meet its acceptance standard for the previous calendar year. (i) A surcharge waiver application must be\nsubmitted to the department by March 1st, for the previous calendar year, on a\nform prescribed by the department. The surcharge waiver application form must\ninclude, but is not limited to: '(a)'\ndetails\nof the acceptance methods provided by the manufacturer's acceptance\nprogram; '(b)'\na description of the\nactions taken by the manufacturer to track and forecast electronic waste\ncollection; '(c)'\na description of\nany actions taken by the manufacturer during the year to increase electronic\nwaste collection; and\n'(d)'\na\ndescription of any actions taken by the manufacturer to improve the acceptance\nprogram's public education and outreach. (ii)\n\nIf the surcharge waiver application is\ndenied by the department, any surcharge due must be paid within 30 days of the\nmanufacturer's receipt of the department's denial. (iii)\nA surcharge waiver provided pursuant to\nthis section does not relieve a manufacturer from the obligation to comply with\nthe provisions of this Subpart, except for the payment of a recycling\nsurcharge.
