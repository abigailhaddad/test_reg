  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6192.3 - Forensic DNA methodology\n\nState Regulations\n(a) DNA databank shall be comprised of data\ngenerated from DNA testing methods approved in the\nNDIS Operating\n\nProcedures. Loci required for the upload to NDIS of authorized DNA\nprofiles shall be in accordance with the\nNDIS Operating\n\nProcedures. (b) Forensic\nDNA profiles to be maintained in the DNA databank shall be comprised of\ninformation for at least the minimum required STR loci or other combinations of\nloci using alternative technologies approved for use in the\nNDIS\nOperating Procedures. This requirement for a minimum number of loci\napplies only to those forensic DNA profiles which an authorized laboratory\ndesires to have maintained in the forensic index of the DNA databank. (c) For purposes of searches of the DNA\ndatabank, the minimum loci required shall be provided by a laboratory\nrequesting a forensic DNA profile search against the DNA databank. Generally, all available loci associated with a forensic DNA profile shall be searched in\nthe DNA databank. Notwithstanding this requirement, the laboratory may, at its\ndiscretion, request that a search be performed using fewer loci if there is an\ninvestigative need and sufficient scientific reasons which support using fewer\nthan the required loci in a particular case. The scientific reasons shall\ninclude, but not be limited to, the apparent presence of mixtures, sample\ndegradation or limited sample availability. The basis of the scientific\nreason(s) must be summarized in the search request whenever fewer than the\nrequired loci are provided with a search request. (d) DNA profiles that may be added to the DNA\ndatabank by forensic DNA laboratories include forensic DNA profiles, convicted\noffender DNA profiles, subject DNA profiles, DNA profiles of missing persons, relatives of individuals reported missing, unidentified humans or human\nremains. (e) In the event of a\npotential indirect association, laboratories should use Y-STR and/or mt DNA\ntesting to help determine if the indirect association should be pursued\nfurther. (f) Pursuant to NDIS, the\ndivision may release the identity of an offender whose DNA profile has been\nindirectly associated through a national CODIS search with a DNA profile in\nanother state's forensic index. The State CODIS laboratory will review requests\nfrom NDIS participating laboratories and notify the division regarding the\npartial match request. The State CODIS laboratory will notify the NDIS\nparticipating laboratory and NDIS custodian if a name is released. Testing of\nadditional loci of the offender sample may be required and may include Y-STR\nand/or mt DNA analysis. (g) The\ndivision may release the name of an offender whose DNA profile has been\nindirectly associated through a State CODIS search with a forensic DNA profile\nwhen it has been determined that the information may lead to the identification\nof an individual related to the offender. For associations obtained from a\n\nState CODIS search, the following conditions must be met: (1)\n\nThe laboratory submitting the forensic\nDNA profile to the CODIS program shall complete an application to the division\nrequesting the name of the offender and, as part of the application, confirm\nthat: (i) an LDIS search has been performed\nusing the profile in the forensic index; (ii)\nthe forensic DNA profile derives from a\nsingle source and contains at least 10 of the CODIS core loci; (iii)\nthe Expected Match Ratio (EMR) and/or\nthe Expected Kinship Ratio (EKR) for the four major ethnic groups in the FBI\nallele frequency databases (or equivalent likelihood ratio approved by the\n\nStateDNA Subcommittee) was calculated and at least one of the fourdatabase\nvalues for EMR or EKR is greater than or equal to 1.0 and all theothers are\ngreater than or equal to 0.1 (or an equivalent pre-determinedstatistical\nmeasure approved by the DNA Subcommittee). If available andappropriate, additional DNA analysis (e.g., Y-STR, mitochondrial) shouldbe\nperformed; (iv)\nthe submitting\nagency and the appropriate prosecutor have committed to pursue further\ninvestigation of the case if the name is released. Such entities also agree to\nprovide follow-up information to the division regarding the outcome of the\ncase, which the division will provide to the DNA Subcommittee at six month\nintervals; and\n(v) the submitting\nlaboratory has confirmed that release of the name will be followed by a\nnotification to the investigating agency. (2)\n\nThe notification from the submitting\nlaboratory to the investigating agency shall indicate that: (i) the association is indirect; (ii)\nthe information provided is an\ninvestigative lead; (iii)\nthe\navailable data suggests that the source of the forensic DNA profile is\npotentially a relative of the convicted offender but is not conclusive evidence\nof the same. (3)\nA\npartial match request from a local CODIS laboratory that satisfies all criteria\ndescribed above will be submitted to the State CODIS laboratory for\nverification. Upon receipt of such verification, the division will release the\nname of the offender to the local CODIS laboratory. If the criteria are not\nsatisfied, the State CODIS laboratory will notify the division and the\nconvicted offender's name will not be released. (h) When there is not a match or a partial\nmatch to a sample in the DNA data bank, a familial search may be performed. To\nperform a familial search, the following case and sample requirements must be\nmet: (1)\n\nThe forensic DNA profile or\nunidentified human remains DNA profile must be associated with: (i) a Penal Law Article 125 felony offense, other than one defined in Penal Law sections 125.40 or 125.45; or\n(ii)\na Penal Law Article 130 offense that is\ndefined as a violent felony offense pursuant to Penal Law section 70.02; or\n(iii)\na class A felony offense\ndefined in Article 130, 135, 150 or 490 of the Penal Law; or\n(iv)\na crime presenting a significant public\nsafety threat. (2)\n\nThe\ninvestigating agency and appropriate prosecutor must certify, in the form and\nmanner required by the division, that: (i) reasonable investigative efforts have been taken in the case; or\n(ii)\nexigent circumstances exist warranting a\nfamilial search. Nothing in this section shall preclude an investigating agency\nand the appropriate prosecutor from requesting a familial search of an\nunidentified profile meeting the criteria set forth in the policy which is\nassociated with a case in which a defendant was previously convicted. (3)\n\nThe forensic DNA profile must: (i) be a single source, or a fully deduced\nprofile originating from a mixture; (ii)\nappear to have a direct connection with\nthe putative perpetrator of the crime; (iii)\nreside in SDIS; and\n(iv)\nhave been searched against DNA profiles\ncontained in the State DNA Databank. (4)\n\nThe unidentified human remains DNA\nprofile must: (i) be a single source\nprofile; (ii)\nhave been developed\nfrom a deceased individual whose identity is unknown and whose death is\nsuspected to involve the commission of a crime enumerated in paragraph (h) (1)\nof this section; (iii)\nreside in\nSDIS; and, (iv)\nhave been searched\nagainst DNA profiles contained in the State DNA Databank\n(i) Any request for a\nfamilial DNA search must be made jointly by the appropriate investigating\nagency and the appropriate prosecutor (hereinafter \"the requestors\") through an\napplication to the division in the form and manner specified by the division. (1)\n\nUpon receipt of an application: (i) The division will confirm that the\nfamilial search requests meets the case requirements in paragraph (h)(1) of\nthis section; and\n(ii)\n\nThe state\nCODIS administrator will confirm that the sample requirements in paragraphs\n(h)(3)(i) and (ii) or (h)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section have been verified by\nthe forensic laboratory that generated the forensic DNA profile or unidentified\nhuman remains DNA profile; and, (iii)\n\nThe state CODIS administrator will\nconfirm that the sample requirements in paragraphs (h)(3)(iii) and (iv) or\n(h)(4)(iii) and (iv)of this section have been met. (2)\n\nThe commissioner shall review all\ncompleted applications. (i) If, upon review\nand evaluation of such application, the commissioner determines that any of the\ncase and/or any of the sample requirements are not satisfied, the division\nshall notify the requestors, in writing, that a familial search cannot be\nperformed and identify the requirements not satisfied. (ii)\n\nIf, upon review and evaluation of such\napplication, the commissioner determines that all of the case and sample\nrequirements have been satisfied, the requestors will be notified in writing\nthat their familial search request has been approved and entered into the queue\nfor search processing. (j) Upon receipt of an approved familial\nsearch application from the division, the New York State Police crime\nlaboratory will: (1)\nuse validated software, which has been approved by the DNA subcommittee and the commission, to perform\na familial search of the DNA databank and generate a candidate list; (2)\nevaluate the candidate list based on\nestablished kinship threshold value(s) approved by the DNA subcommittee and\ncommission; (3)\nperform Y-STR\ntesting on the candidate sample(s) if the forensic DNA profile or unidentified\nhuman remains DNA profile is from a male individual and sufficient forensic DNA\nsample exists for Y-STR testing; and, (4)\nif appropriate, ensure additional testing\nis performed on the candidate sample, provided there is sufficient forensic DNA\nsample or unidentified human remains DNA profile available for\ntesting. (k) In order\nfor the results of a familial DNA search to be released, the following\nconditions must be met: (1)\n\nIf the candidate\nprofile(s) exceed the established kinship thresh-old value(s), and are not\nexcluded by additional testing performed, the name(s) of the offender(s) in the\nDNA databank will be released to the requestors. The familial DNA search\nresults shall be provided in writing and shall include the following\nstatements: (i) The information provided is\nfor investigatory law enforcement purposes only; (ii)\n\nThe forensic DNA profile or unidentified\nhuman remains DNA profile could not have come from the named offender in the\nDNA databank; (iii)\n\nThe information\nprovided is not a definitive statement of a familial (i.e., biological)\nrelationship; and, (iv)\n\nThe\ninformation provided shall be treated only as an investigative lead. (2)\n\nThe requestors must\nsatisfactorily complete, and demonstrate an under standing of, a mandatory, in-person, or at the discretion of the commissioner, video conference training. At a minimum, the training shall address: (i) how a familial search is conducted, including the limitations of the\nmethod; (ii)\nguidance on how to best\nevaluate leads from a familial search in order to protect unknown family\nrelationships (donor parents/adoptions, previously unknown\nrelatives); (iii)\nthe\nconfidentiality requirements associated with the DNA Data bank records, and any\nsamples, analysis or other related documents (see Executive Law sections 995-c; 995-d; 995-f); (iv)\nthe requirement\nto withdraw a request if a suspect or the human remains are identified through\nother means before the familial search is completed; and, (v) the requirement to provide follow-up\ninformation to the division regarding the case at intervals determined by the\ndivision\n(3)\n\nIf no\ncandidate profile(s) on the candidate list exceed the established kinship\nthreshold value(s), no name will be released and the requestors will be\nnotified as such, in writing. (4)\n\nThe forensic DNA profile or unidentified human remains DNA profile can be\nresearched against the DNA databank upon renewal of the request. In the absence\nof exigent circumstances, such requests may be made every six months from the\nnotification that there were no candidates identified. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
