Tit. 10 §§ 5-1.76 - Consecutive public water systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When a public water system supplies water to one or more consecutive public water systems, the State may modify the monitoring requirements of this Subpart when the circumstances justify treating them as a single system for monitoring purposes. Any modified monitoring shall be conducted pursuant to a schedule approved by the State, in accordance with the provisions of section\n5-1.52\nof this Subpart. (b) Consecutive systems must follow section\n5-1.52\ntable 11B of this Subpart in the event of a total coliform positive sample from their distribution system. When a consecutive system that receives ground water from a wholesale system is notified of a positive total coliform sample result, the consecutive system must, within 24 hours, notify the State, the wholesale system and any other wholesale system that owns and/or operates groundwater sources that provides water used by the consecutive system. If all the water provided by the consecutive system has been subject to four-log virus treatment and process compliance monitoring, notification by the consecutive system about the total coliform sample is not required. After notification, the wholesaler must, within 24 hours, test its raw water source(s) for fecal indicator organism(s) in accordance with section\n5-1.52\ntable 11B of this Subpart at the location(s) specified in the monitoring plan described in section\n5-1.51\nof this Subpart.
