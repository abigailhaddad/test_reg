Tit. 18 § 311.4 - Continuing responsibility of district of former residence\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In accordance\nwith paragraph (d) of subdivision 5 of section\n62\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law, if a town, city or county provides care for a person in a\nfamily home, boarding home, intermediate care facility, nursing home, hospital\nor institution outside of its territory and pays the vendor or supplier for\nsuch care, or sends a grant to the recipient, the agency making such provision\nshall continue to be responsible for payment for such care as long as the\nrecipient of assistance or care is in need thereof. In the event that any other\ntype of public assistance and care is needed by a person receiving such care, it shall be furnished and paid for by the public welfare agency which would be\nresponsible for such required assistance and care if such person had remained\nin the territory of the town, city or county making such provision. (1)\n\nThe phrase provides care means makes\narrangements or participates actively in making arrangements for care directly\nor indirectly, in whole or in part. (2)\n\nThe word person includes both adult and\nchild. (3)\n\nFor adults, the term\nfacility means the home of a relative or close friend in which the arrangement\nfor board and care is not a commercial one even though public funds are needed. Ordinarily, payment would not exceed cost of food and shelter, i.e., there\nwould be no charge for service and no element of profit. (4)\n\nIn the case of children, a family home\nmeans the home of a relative or guardian to whom payment may be made through\npublic assistance grants. (5)\n\nFor\nadults, the term boarding home means board and room, with or without extra\ncare, arranged for on a commercial basis, with the rate paid povering [FN1]\nprofit or payment for services required. It also includes shelter provided\nunder protective conditions, with or without meals on the premises, for youths\nor handicapped adults during a period of training or treatment. (6)\n\nFor children, the boarding home means a\nhome or institution or a home in which a minor between the ages of 16 and 18 is\nplaced under the provisions of paragraph (i) of subdivision 6 of section\n398\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law. (7)\n\nThe term\ninstitution includes a public or private child caring institution, a private\nhome for the aged, a private institution for the blind, a public home or\ninfirmary.

(9)\n\nAny other type of care\nincludes hospital or other institutional care for a person already receiving\ncare in a family home, boarding home, intermediate care facility, nursing home, home for the aged, etc.; care in a family home, boarding home, intermediate\ncare facility, nursing home, etc., for a person who has been receiving care in\na hospital or other institution; clothing, medical services or supplies or\nother special items of assistance for a person receiving care under any of the\nspecified conditions; or burial for any such person. (10)\n\nUnder the provisions of an amendment to\nparagraph (c) of subdivision 5 of section\n62\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law, a new paragraph was added which relates to the termination\nof continuing liability as to children. This revision is incorporated in\nchapter 41 of the Laws of 1958. Thereunder, when a child who has been cared for\naway from his home by or on behalf of a public welfare district, pursuant to\ntitle 2 of article 6 or other provisions of the Social Services Law, the\n\nChildren's Court Act of the State of New York, the Domestic Relations Court Act\nof the City of New York, or other provisions of law is discharged, pursuant to\nlaw, to his parents, or parent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt or legal guardian, who are or is then residing outside the territory of such public welfare\ndistrict, this formal discharge shall terminate the responsibility of such\npublic welfare district to furnish assistance and care for such child; following such a discharge it shall become the responsibility of the public\nwelfare district wherein such child is thereafter to reside with his relative\nor legal guardian to provide such assistance and care for him as for any other\nchild residing in the district. (i) The\nprimary purpose and effect of this revision is to recognize the distinction\nbetween a formal and permanent discharge of a child from foster care to \"his\nown home\" and a temporary or \"on trial\" return of the child to his own home\nfrom foster care. (11)\n\nWhen a recipient of public assistance or care removes himself from a town, city\nor county and establishes himself in some other town, city or county on a\ntemporary or permanent basis, without the knowledge, consent and active\nparticipation of the public welfare official from whom he receives assistance\nor care, such official cannot be held responsible for continuing to provide\ncare except as such absence falls within the temporary absence provisions\nrelating to AB, AD, ADC or OAA. Similarly, when care is provided outside the\nterritory in other than a family home, boarding home, intermediate care\nfacility, nursing home, hospital or institution, the public welfare official\nhas no continuing responsibility. The official in the new district is\nresponsible therefor. Policies and procedures described in sections 311.2 and\n311.3, supra, and department\ninstructions apply. (b) Social services districts must offer and provide emergency shelter and services\nto victims of domestic violence, as defined in section\n452.2\n(g) of this\n\nTitle, who are in receipt of or eligible for emergency assistance to needy\nfamilies, aid to dependent children, home relief or any other form of public\nassistance and care under sections\n131\nor\n131-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, at an approved residential program for victims of\ndomestic violence to the extent that such shelter is necessary and available. The social services district in which a victim of domestic violence was\nresiding at the time of the alleged domestic violence incident is responsible\nfor the costs of shelter, care and services provided to such victim and his or\nher children at a department approved residential program for victims of\ndomestic violence located in another social services district, if the victim\nwas in receipt of public assistance and care at the time of admission to such\nresidential program or if the victim applies for emergency assistance to needy\nfamilies, aid to dependent children, home relief or any other form of public\nassistance and care under sections\n131\nor\n131-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, during the time of residency in such program and is\nfound eligible for such assistance and care. If a victim of an alleged domestic\nviolence incident is in a department approved residential program for victims\nof domestic violence located in a social services district, other than the\ndistrict in which he or she resided at the time of the domestic violence\nincident, he or she may apply for assistance and care in the social services\ndistrict in which the program is located. The social services district to which\nsuch application is submitted must forward the completed application, within\nfive days of its receipt, to the district in which the victim resided at the\ntime of the domestic violence incident. Responsibility for the costs of such\nshelter, care and services is limited to the period during which the victim and\nhis or her children reside in such program. Responsibility for public\nassistance and care for any period after termination of such residency must be\ndetermined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this\nsection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
