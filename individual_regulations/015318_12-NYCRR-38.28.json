  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.28 - Records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\nprovisions. (1)\n\nEach licensee or registrant\nshall use the SI units: becquerel, gray, sievert and coulomb per kilogram, or\nthe special units: curie, rad, rem, and roentgen, including multiples and\nsubdivisions, and shall clearly indicate the units of all quantities on records\nrequired by this Part (rule). (2)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall make a clear distinction among the quantities\nentered on the records required by this Part (rule): such as, total effective\ndose equivalent, shallow dose equivalent, eye dose equivalent, deep dose\nequivalent, or committed effective dose equivalent. (3)\n\nEach record required by this Part (rule)\nshall be legible throughout the specified retention period and maintained in a\nform specified in this paragraph. The record shall be the original or a\nreproduced copy or a microform, provided that the copy or microform is\nauthenticated by authorized personnel and that the microform is capable of\nproducing a clear copy throughout the required retention period. The record may\nalso be stored in electronic media with the capability for producing legible, accurate, and complete records during the required retention period. Records, such as letters, drawings, and specifications shall include pertinent\ninformation, such as stamps, initials, and signatures. The licensee shall\nmaintain safeguards sufficient to prevent tampering with and loss of\nrecords. (4)\n\nThe discontinuance of\nor curtailment of activities does not relieve any person who possesses any\nradiation source of responsibility for retaining all records required by this\n\nPart. (b) Records of\nradiation protection programs. (1)\n\nEach\nlicensee or registrant shall maintain records of the radiation protection\nprogram, including: (i) the provisions of the\nprogram; and\n(ii)\naudits and other\nreviews of program content and implementation.

The licensee or registrant shall retain the records required by\nsubparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision for three years after the record is\nmade. (c) Records of\nsurveys, checks, tests and calibrations. (1)\n\nEach licensee or registrant shall maintain records showing the results of\nsurveys, checks, tests and calibrations required by this Part (rule). (i) These records must show the date, the\nsurvey, check, test or calibration performed, the name of the individual\nperforming the function, and the results. (ii)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall retain\nthese records for three years after the record is made. (2)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall retain\neach of the following records until the commissioner terminates each pertinent\nlicense or registration requiring the record: (i) records of the results of surveys to\ndetermine the dose from external sources of radiation used, in the absence of\nor in combination with individual monitoring data, in the assessment of\nindividual dose equivalents; and\n(ii)\nrecords of the results of measurements\nand calculations used to determine individual intakes of radioactive material\nand used in the assessment of internal dose; and\n(iii)\nrecords showing the results of air\nsampling, surveys, and bioassays required pursuant to section\n38.26\nof this Part (rule); and\n(iv)\nrecords of the results of\nmeasurements and calculations used to evaluate the release of radioactive\neffluents to unrestricted areas. (3)\n\nRecords of tests for leakage or\ncontamination of sealed sources required by section\n38.22\nof this Part (rule) shall be\nkept in units of becquerels or microcuries and maintained for inspection by the\ncommissioner. (d) Records of prior occupational dose. The licensee or registrant shall retain the\nrecords of prior occupational dose and exposure history as specified in section\n38.18\n(e) of this\n\nPart (rule) on the department form for cumulative occupational radiation\nexposure history or equivalent until the commissioner terminates each pertinent\nlicense or registration, and shall retain the records used in preparing the\nform or equivalent for three years after the record is made. (e) Records of planned special exposures. (1)\n\nFor each use of the provisions of section\n38.18\n(f) of this\n\nPart (rule) for planned special exposures, the licensee or registrant shall\nmaintain records that describe: (i) the\nexceptional circumstances requiring the use of a planned special exposure; and\n(ii)\nthe name of the management\nofficial who authorized the planned special exposure and a copy of the signed\nauthorization; and\n(iii)\nwhat\nactions were necessary; and\n(iv)\nwhy the actions were necessary; and\n(v) what precautions were taken to assure\nthat doses were maintained ALARA; and\n(vi)\nwhat individual and collective doses\nwere expected to result; and\n(vii)\nthe doses actually received in the planned special exposure. (2)\n\nThe licensee or registrant\nshall retain the records until the commissioner terminates each pertinent\nlicense or registration requiring the record. (f) Records of individual monitoring results. (1)\n\nRecordkeeping requirement. Each licensee\nor registrant shall maintain records of doses received by all individuals for\nwhom monitoring was required pursuant to section\n38.24\nof this Part (rule), and\nrecords of doses received during planned special exposures, accidents, and\nemergency conditions. Assessments of dose equivalent and records made using\nunits in effect before the effective date of this Part (rule) need not be\nchanged. These records shall include, when applicable: (i) the deep dose equivalent to the whole\nbody, eye dose equivalent, shallow dose equivalent to the skin, and shallow\ndose equivalent to the extremities; and\n(ii)\nthe estimated intake of radionuclides\n(see section\n38.18\n[ b]of this Part [rule]); and\n(iii)\nthe committed effective\ndose equivalent assigned to the intake of radionuclides; and\n(iv)\nthe specific information used to\ncalculate the committed effective dose equivalent pursuant to section\n38.18\n(d) of this\n\nPart (rule); and\n(v) the total\neffective dose equivalent when required by section\n38.18\n(b) of this\n\nPart (rule); and\n(vi)\nthe total of\nthe deep dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent to the organ\nreceiving the highest total dose. (2)\n\nRecordkeeping frequency. The licensee or\nregistrant shall make entries of the records specified in this subdivision at\nleast annually. (3)\n\nRecordkeeping\nformat. The licensee or registrant shall maintain the records specified in this\nsubdivision on the department form for occupational radiation exposure records\nfor a monitoring period, or in clear and legible records containing all the\ninformation required by such form. (4)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall maintain\nthe records of dose to an embryo/fetus with the records of dose to the declared\npregnant woman. The declaration of pregnancy, including the estimated date of\nconception or the estimated age of the embryo/fetus in days or weeks as of the\ndate of declaration, shall also be kept on file, but may be maintained\nseparately from the dose records.

(1)\n\nEach licensee\nshall maintain the following records: (i) Records of spills or other occurrences involving the spread of contamination in\nand around the installation, equipment, or site. These records may be limited\nto instances when contamination remains after cleanup procedures or when there\nis reasonable likelihood that contaminants may have spread to inaccessible\nareas as in the case of possible seepage into porous materials such as\nconcrete. These records must include any known information on identification of\ninvolved nuclides, quantities, forms, and concentrations. (ii)\n\nAs-built drawings and modifications of\nstructures and equipment in restricted areas where radioactive materials are\nused and/or stored, and of locations of possible inaccessible contamination\nsuch as buried pipes which may be subject to contamination. If required\ndrawings are referenced, each relevant document need not be indexed\nindividually. If drawings are not available, the licensee shall substitute\nappropriate records of available information concerning these areas and\nlocations. (iii)\n\nRecords of the\ncost estimate performed for the decommissioning funding plan or of the amount\ncertified for decommissioning, and records of the funding method used for\nassuring funds if either a funding plan or certification is required pursuant\nto section\n38.7\nof this Part\n(rule). (2)\n\nRecords of\ninformation important to the safe decommissioning of the installation shall be\nkept in an identified location until the license is terminated by the\ncommissioner. Notes\nN.Y.
