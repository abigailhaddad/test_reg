  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 262.1 - Allocation of wage or salary income to the City of Yonkers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where wage or salary income is earned by\na nonresident taxpayer for services performed partly within and partly without\nthe City of Yonkers, an allocation to the City of Yonkers must be\nmade. (b) If the wage or salary\nincome subject to allocation is not dependent directly on the volume of\nbusiness transacted, the amount allocable to the City of Yonkers is that\nportion of wage or salary income which the number of days worked in the City of\n\nYonkers bears to the total number of days (exclusive of nonworking days, including Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, days of absence because of illness or\npersonal injury, vacation, or leave with or without pay) worked both within and\nwithout the City of Yonkers. Workdays are days on which the taxpayer is\nrequired to perform the usual duties of his employment, and do not ordinarily\ninclude activities carried on at such taxpayer's home. (c) If the nonresident taxpayer's\ncompensation subject to allocation depends entirely on volume of business\ntransacted, as in the case of a salesman working on commission, the amount of\ncompensation allocable to the City of Yonkers is that portion of such\ntaxpayer's compensation which the volume of business transacted within the City\nof Yonkers bears to the total volume of business transacted both within and\nwithout the City of Yonkers. The determining factor in ascertaining where\nbusiness is transacted is the location where the services or sales activities\nwere actually performed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n262.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
