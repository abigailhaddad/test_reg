A licensee satisfies the requirement to categorize the nonpublic personal financial information that it collects if the licensee categorizes it according to the source of the information, as applicable: (i) information from the consumer; (ii)\ninformation about the consumer's transactions with the licensee or its affiliates; (iii)\ninformation about the consumer's transactions with nonaffiliated third parties; and\n(iv)\ninformation from a consumer reporting agency. (2)\n\nCategories of nonpublic personal financial information a licensee discloses. (i) A licensee satisfies the requirement to categorize nonpublic personal financial information it discloses if the licensee categorizes the information according to source, as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, as applicable, and provides a few examples to illustrate the types of information in each category. These might include: (a) information from the consumer, including application information, such as assets and income and identifying information, such as name, address and social security number; (b) transaction information, such as information about balances, payment history and parties to the transaction; and\n(c) information from consumer reports, such as a consumer's creditworthiness and credit history. (ii)\nA licensee does not adequately categorize the information that it discloses if the licensee uses only general terms, such as transaction information about the consumer. (iii)\n\nIf a licensee reserves the right to disclose all of the nonpublic financial information about consumers that it collects, the licensee may simply state that fact without describing the categories or examples of nonpublic personal financial information that the licensee discloses. (3)\n\nCategories of affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to whom the licensee discloses. (i) A licensee satisfies the requirement to categorize the affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to which the licensee discloses nonpublic personal financial information about consumers if the licensee identifies the types of businesses in which they engage. (ii)\n\nTypes of businesses may be described by general terms only if the licensee uses a few illustrative examples of significant lines of business. For example, a licensee may use the term financial products or services if it includes appropriate examples of significant lines of businesses, such as life insurer, automobile insurer, consumer banking or securities brokerage. (iii)\nA licensee also may categorize the affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to which it discloses nonpublic personal financial information about consumers using more detailed categories. (4)\n\nDisclosures under exception for service providers and joint marketers.

(6)\n\nConfidentiality and security.

The licensee is not required to describe technical information about the safeguards it uses. (d) Short-form initial notice with opt out notice for noncustomers.

(4)\n\nExamples of obtaining privacy notice.
