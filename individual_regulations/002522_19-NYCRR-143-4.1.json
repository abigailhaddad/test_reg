  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 §§ 143-4.1 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ncentral filing office maintains a searchable index for all records of UCC\ndocuments. The index provides for the retrieval of a record by the name of the\ndebtor and by the file number of the initial financing statement to which the\nrecord relates, and associates with one another each initial financing\nstatement and each filed UCC document relating to the initial financing\nstatement. (b) The searchable index\nmaintained by the central filing office consists of an index of names entered\nprior to July 1, 2001 (the pre-July 1, 2001 index) and an index of names\nentered on or after July 1, 2001 (the post-July 1, 2001 index). The following\nrules were followed when the names were entered in the pre-July 1, 2001 index: (1)\n\nDebtors were not classified as\norganizations or individuals. The pre-July 1, 2001 index is a single index that\nincludes all debtors (individual and organization). (2)\n\nDebtor names were entered into the\npre-July 1, 2001 index exactly as the names appeared in the filed\ndocument. (3)\n\nIn the case of\ndebtors that were (or appeared to be) individuals, no distinction was made\nbetween prefixes (if any), first names, middle names or initials (if any), last\nnames, or suffixes (if any). Each name component was entered in the pre-July 1, 2001 index in the order specified in the filed document (e.g., if the document\nspecified the debtor name as \"John C. Smith\", the name was entered in the\npre-July 1, 2001 index as \"JOHN C. SMITH\", and if the document specified the\ndebtor name as \"Smith, John C.,\" the name was entered in the pre-July 1, 2001\nindex as \"SMITH JOHN C.\"). (4)\n\nThe\ncentral filing office also maintains an alternative name index (the alternative\nname index) for certain filings made prior to July 1, 2001. In some cases, one\nor more variations of the debtor name as specified in a document filed prior to\n\nJuly 1, 2001 may have been entered in the alternative name index. For example, if a document filed prior to July 1, 2001 specified the debtor name as \"John\nand Mary Smith\", the name would have been entered in the pre-July 1, 2001 index\nas \"JOHN AND MARY SMITH\" and, in some cases, the name may also have been\nentered in the alternative name index as \"JOHN SMITH\" and \"MARY SMITH\", and if\na document filed prior to July 1, 2001 specified the debtor name as \" John\n\nSmith, d/b/a John's Garage\", the name would have been entered in the pre-July\n1, 2001 index as \"JOHN SMITH D/B/A JOHN'S GARAGE\" and, in some cases, the name\nmay also have been entered in the alternative name index as \"JOHN SMITH\" and\n\"JOHN'S GARAGE\". Note, however, in some cases (including but not limited to\nsome cases similar to the examples set forth in the preceding sentence), no\nentry in the alternative name index was made. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§§\n143-4.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
