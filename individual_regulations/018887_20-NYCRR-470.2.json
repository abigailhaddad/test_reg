  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 470.2 - Definition of a motor vehicle\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 501(2) 503-a(9)\n(a) Article 21 of the Tax Law contains a\ndefinition of \"motor vehicle\" which differs from the ordinary definition. The\nterm\nmotor vehicle\nis defined to mean: (1)\nany self-propelled device and any trailer\nor other device drawn thereby used upon the public highways having a maximum\ngross weight, alone or in combination with another motor vehicle, in excess of\n18,000 pounds; (2)\nany truck having\nan unloaded weight in excess of 8,000 pounds; (3)\nany tractor having an unloaded weight in\nexcess of 4,000 pounds (for definition of maximum gross weight and unloaded\nweight, see section\n472.1\net. seq. ); and\n(4)\nany omnibus engaged in the interstate or foreign transportation of passengers\nand subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, or any\nagency successor thereto, or one or more State regulatory agencies concerned\nwith the regulations of passenger transport, having a seating capacity of more\nthan seven persons in addition to the driver. (b) The following vehicles are not motor\nvehicles under this definition: (1)\ntruck\nwith an unloaded weight of 8,000 pounds or less and a maximum gross weight of\n18,000 pounds or less; (2)\ntractor\nwith an unloaded weight of 4,000 pounds or less and a maximum gross weight of\n18,000 pounds or less; (3)\ntrailer, semi-trailer, dolly, or other device drawn by a motor vehicle, with a maximum\ngross weight, alone or in combination with another motor vehicle, of 18,000\npounds or less. In this Subchapter, the term\nmotor\nvehicle\nwill be used as defined in subdivision (a) of this\nsection. Example 1: A tractor having an unloaded weight of 3,500 pounds, but\na maximum gross weight of 19,000 pounds when used in combination with a\ntrailer, is a motor vehicle. Example 2: A semi-trailer having an unloaded weight of 10,000\npounds, but a maximum gross weight of 49,000 pounds when used in combination\nwith a tractor, is a motor vehicle. Example 3: A truck having an unloaded weight of 8,500 pounds and a\nmaximum gross weight of 16,000 pounds is a motor vehicle. Example 4: A tractor having an unloaded weight of 5,000 pounds and a\nmaximum gross weight of 15,000 pounds, when used in combination with a trailer, is a motor vehicle. (c) A tow truck pulling a disabled motor\nvehicle is not deemed to be operating in combination with such motor vehicle. Therefore, if the unloaded weight of the tow truck is 8,000 pounds or less, it\nis not a motor vehicle. However, if the unloaded weight of the tow truck\nexceeds 8,000 pounds, it is a motor vehicle. Example 1: A tow truck, having an unloaded weight of 20,000 pounds\npulls a disabled snow plow weighing 35,000 pounds; the tow truck is a motor\nvehicle. Example 2: A tow truck having an unloaded weight of 7,000 pounds\npulls a disabled truck weighing 18,500 pounds; the tow truck is not a motor\nvehicle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
