Tit. 9 § 4045.3 - Points\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When a\nprecipitating equine drug rule violation occurs, the commission shall examine\nthe equine drug rule violation history of the violator and assign a point value\nto the equine drug rule violations as set forth in this section. (b) The commission shall assign six points, which shall accumulate with points resulting from other violations committed\nwithin a three-year period, for a violation involving a drug or other substance\nthat: (1)\nis classified as Penalty Class A in\nthe ARCI Penalty Guidelines; or\n(2)\nis not classified in the ARCI Penalty Guidelines, but has a very high potential\nto affect race performance and no generally accepted veterinary use in racing\nhorses, subject to any adjustments that apply as set forth in this\nsection. (c) The\ncommission shall assign four points, which shall accumulate with points\nresulting from other violations committed within a two-year period, for a\nviolation involving a drug or other substance that: (1)\nis classified as Penalty Class B in the\nARCI Penalty Guidelines; or\n(2)\nis\nnot classified in the ARCI Penalty Guidelines, but has a high potential to\naffect race performance and\n(i) has a high\npotential for abuse; or\n(ii)\nhas no\ngenerally accepted veterinary use in racing horses, subject to any adjustments\nthat apply as set forth in this section. (d) The commission shall assign one point, which shall accumulate with points resulting from other violations committed\nwithin a one-year period, for a violation involving a drug or other substance\nthat is classified as Penalty Class C in the ARCI Penalty Guidelines, subject\nto any adjustments that apply as set forth in this section. (e) When more than one violation described in\nsubdivision (d) of this section is committed within a 365-day period, the\ncommission shall assign an additional penalty of one-half point for each\nprevious violation (e.g., a second such violation within a 365-day period\nincurs an additional one-half point, a third such violation incurs an\nadditional one point) in addition to the points assessed pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of this section. (f) The point values set forth in subdivisions (c) and (d) of this section are\nreduced by one-half for any drug or other substance that is listed in section\n4043.3\nof this\n\nSubchapter. (g) No points shall be\nassigned for a violation involving a drug or other substance that has no effect\non the physiology of a racing horse except to improve nutrition or to treat or\nprevent infections or parasite infestations. (h) No points shall be assigned for any\nviolations that occurred before January 1, 2014. (i) If a violation involves more than one\ndrug or substance, then the commission shall assign to such violation not less\nthan the highest point value of any one of the drugs or substances and shall\nassign additional points for each drug or substance that could have the effect\nof substantially altering the nature or effect of such drugs or other\nsubstances on the horse. No points shall be assessed for more than one\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) when there has been only an NSAID\nstacking violation. (j) If multiple\nviolations involving one drug or substance are committed before a licensee is\nnotified of a positive laboratory test, then the commission may assign lesser\npoints for the violations, although not less than the points for a single\nviolation, when the responsible parties are able to show that the multiple\nviolations occurred as the result of an honest and unavoidable mistake. If such\nan assessment of lesser points had been made by the jurisdiction in which a\npredicate equine drug violation occurred, or such jurisdiction had assigned\nlesser (even zero) points due to environmental contamination, then the\ncommission shall assign such lesser points for the violation. (k) The commission shall assign point values\nas of the date of a violation. (l) Points assigned for an equine drug rule violation are not removed from a\nlicensee's record when they serve as a basis to suspend a license. Points\ncontinue to accumulate for the time periods that are set forth in subdivisions\n(c), (d) and (e) of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
