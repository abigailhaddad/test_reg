  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 76.1 - Statement of policy; explanation\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn enacting the CRA, the New York State Legislature required\nthe Superintendent to assess a banking institution's record of helping to meet\nthe credit needs of the local communities in which the banking institution is\nchartered, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the banking\ninstitution, and to take this record into account in the Department's\nevaluation of those applications by banking institutions which are enumerated\nin sections 28-b, 225 and 413 of the New York State Banking Law. This Part is\nintended to carry out the purposes of the CRA. This Part establishes the\nframework and criteria by which the Department assesses a banking institution's\nrecord of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including\nlow- and moderate income neighborhoods and minority- and women-owned\nbusinesses, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the banking\ninstitution. In conducting such an assessment, the Department may evaluate the\nbanking institution by performing its CRA examination on-site at the\ninstitution or, alternatively, at the Department; may require the submission of\nwritten responses to Department requests for documentation and other\ninformation, including responses to the so-called \"First Day Letter\" or similar\nrequests; may interview banking institution personnel; may conduct branch\nvisits; and may require any other information or documentation, or utilize any\nother procedure that the Superintendent deems necessary. With respect to New\n\nYork State-chartered multi-state banking institutions, the Department will\nrely, in part, on the CRA evaluation by the host state, commonwealth or\nterritory with regard to the branches located in the host state, commonwealth\nor territory or, in those instances in which there is no host state, commonwealth or territory CRA evaluation, upon the CRA evaluation of the\nappropriate Federal regulatory authorities; however, the Department will\nindependently review the factors set forth in section 28-b.3(a)(1), (2) and (3)\nof the Banking Law.
