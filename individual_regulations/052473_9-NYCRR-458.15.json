  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 458.15 - Seasonal signs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Seasonal\nsigns are signs which inform the highway user of conditions or regulations\nwhich are present or in effect for less than the full 12 months of the year. It\nis not practical to consider a period shorter than two months as a season. The\nfollowing are acceptable methods of displaying seasonal signs: (1)\n\nErect the sign as a permanent sign and\nremove or cover it when it is not required. (2)\n\nHinge the sign along its horizontal axis\nso that one portion may be folded over the other portion to obscure the\nmessage. (b) The height, lateral and longitudinal placements of seasonal signs should comply with the\nerection specifications for permanently mounted signs. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n458.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
