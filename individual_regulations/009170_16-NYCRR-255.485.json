  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.485 - Remedial measures: transmission lines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each segment of transmission line with\ngeneral corrosion and with a remaining wall thickness less than that required\nfor the maximum allowable operating pressure of the pipeline must be replaced\nor the operating pressure reduced commensurate with the strength of the pipe\nbased on actual remaining wall thickness. However, if the area of general\ncorrosion is small, the corroded pipe may be repaired by a method that reliable\nengineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability\nof the pipe. Corrosion pitting so closely grouped as to affect the overall\nstrength of the pipe is considered general corrosion. (b) Each segment of transmission line pipe\nwith localized corrosion pitting to a degree where leakage might result must be\nreplaced or repaired or the operating pressure reduced commensurate with the\nstrength of the pipe based on the actual remaining wall thickness in the\npits. (c) Under subdivisions (a)\nand (b) of this section, the strength of transmission line pipe based on actual\nremaining wall thickness may be determined by the procedure in ASME B31G (as\ndescribed in section\n10.3\nof this Title), or other\napproved procedures, applicable to corroded regions that do not penetrate the\npipe wall, subject to the limitations prescribed in the procedures. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.485\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
