The terms and factors referenced in this subdivision use\nmedical terms of art in the context of best medical practice and are parameters\nby which providers should prospectively determine whether an in-person physical\nexamination is necessary and should not be the basis of a denial by carriers, self-insured employers, or third-party administrators. (1)\n\nFactors where an in-person physical\nexamination may not be necessary and therefore treatment by telehealth may be\nmedically appropriate include but are not limited to: (i) Management of chronic conditions where\nthe Authorized Medical Provider has previously conducted a medically\nappropriate and comprehensive in-person assessment of the patient and condition\nand is fully familiar with the applicable medical history. (ii)\n\nDiscussion of test results. (iii)\n\nCounseling about diagnostic and\ntherapeutic options.

(vii)\n\nMental health counseling, for which\nin-person assessment of body movements, postures, and other nonverbal cues is\nnot needed for accurate diagnosis, treatment, or interim assessment of a\ncondition or the potential adverse side-effects of a medication. (viii)\n\nOther clinical scenarios as may be\nprescribed in Medical Treatment Guidelines or other related Board\ncommunications. (2)\n\nFactors that indicate an in-person physical examination is necessary and\ntreatment via telehealth is not medically appropriate include but are not\nlimited to: (i) Health concerns that require\na procedure. (ii)\n\nAbdominal pain, chest pain, clinically altered mental status, any situation in which it appears\nthe claimant may pose a risk to themselves or others, severe headache, signs or\nsymptoms of a stroke, or any other clinical presentation that is generally\naccepted as requiring in-person, emergent or urgent medical assessment, and for\nwhich in-person resources (e.g. regional hospital emergency departments or\nfree-standing urgent care centers, as may be clinically appropriate) are\nreadily available. (iii)\n\nEye or\nvision complaints. (iv)\n\nHighly\nnuanced or multiple complex health concerns requiring an in-person examination\nto assess subtle interactions between co-morbidities or medications. (v) Any situation in which an in-person\nphysical exam might reasonably impact the accuracy, quality, or certainty of\nthe Authorized Medical Provider's assessment, treatment, or\nrecommendations. (vi)\n\nAny situation\nwhere an in-person physical examination is needed to assess disability or range\nof motion, including but not limited to strength testing, formal range of\nmotion testing, assessment of joint stability, nuanced orthopedic and/or\nneurologic testing, spirometry or pulmonary function testing, or exercise\ntolerance testing. (vii)\n\nAny\nphysical therapy, occupational therapy, or chiropractic services utilizing\nphysical modalities other than instruction on range of motion or strengthening\nexercises. (viii)\n\nAny other\nclinical scenarios as may be prescribed in Medical Treatment Guidelines or\nother related Board communications. (ix)\n\nAssessment of causal relationship for an\ninjury or illness unless an in-person physical examination is not necessary to\nmake the determination of causal relationship, in which case the Authorized\n\nMedical Provider must specifically articulate in the medical record why an\nin-person examination was not necessary in order to make a determination of\ncausal relationship. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding any of the factors listed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the following procedures or situations are not medically appropriate for\ntelehealth: (i) Urine drug testing. (ii)\n\nThe initial prescription of long-term\nmedications or follow-up monitoring of those medications without periodic\nin-person evaluation. (iii)\n\nWhere\nthe nature of treatment set forth in the Medical Treatment Guidelines\nnecessitates an in-person examination. (iv)\n\nAssessment of permanent\ndisability. (v) Any other clinical\nscenarios as may be outlined by the Board in Medical Treatment Guidelines or\nother related Board communications. (vi)\n\nThe patient lacks suitable technology or\nequipment necessary to conduct the telehealth visit. (vii)\n\nThe patient has physical and/or\ncognitive challenges that would be a barrier to an effective telehealth visit\n(without the assistance of another individual). (viii)\n\nThe patient has expressed a preference\nfor an in-person visit, as well as a willingness and capability to travel to an\nin-person visit. (d) Independent Medical Examinations (IMEs)\nare not treatment under the Workers' Compensation Law. Accordingly, IMEs\nconducted pursuant to section\n300.2\nof this Title and section\n137\nof the Workers' Compensation Law, may be conducted via telehealth when all\nparties of interest consent to such telehealth examination, and the independent\nmedical examiner is not offering an opinion on permanent impairment.
