  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.31 - Exhibit 31: local laws and ordinances\n\nState Regulations\n\nBefore preparing the exhibit required by this section, the\napplicant shall consult with the municipalities or other local agencies whose\nrequirements are the subject of the exhibit to determine whether the applicant\nhas correctly identified all such requirements and to determine whether any\npotential request by the applicant that the board elect to not apply any such\nlocal requirement could be obviated by design changes to the proposed facility, or otherwise. As the information to be included in the application\npursuant to this section will be used by parties to determine their positions\nin the issues conference and the remainder of the hearing phase of the\nproceeding, the lists should be created with care so as not to cause any party\nto needlessly expend resources due to a misclassification. For local procedural\nrequirements supplanted by PSL section 172, the applicant shall not request\nthat the board elect not to apply them. Misclassification of items or the\ninclusion of unnecessary or inappropriate items may be grounds for finding the\napplication not in compliance. Applicants must carefully screen their lists to\ncorrectly reflect local actions not for the construction or operation of the\nproposed major electric generating facility. Exhibit 31 shall contain: (a) A list of all local ordinances, laws, resolutions, regulations, standards and other requirements applicable to the\nconstruction or operation of the proposed major electric generating facility\n(includes interconnection electric transmission lines and fuel gas transmission\nlines that are not subject to review under article VII of the PSL) that are of\na procedural nature. These local procedural requirements are supplanted by PSL\narticle 10 unless the board expressly authorizes the exercise of the procedural\nrequirement by the local municipality or agency. (b) A list of all local procedural\nrequirements required to be identified pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection for which the applicant requests that the board expressly authorize the\nexercise of the procedural requirement by the local municipality or agency, including a statement why such local exercise would be desirable or\nappropriate. (c) Identification of\nthe city, town, village, county, or State agency qualified by the Secretary of\n\nState that shall review and approve the building plans, inspect the\nconstruction work, and certify compliance with the New York State Uniform Fire\n\nPrevention and Building Code, the Energy Conservation Construction Code of New\n\nYork State, and the substantive provisions of any applicable local electrical, plumbing or building code. If no other arrangement can be made, the Department\nof State should be identified. The statement of identification shall include a\ndescription of the preliminary arrangement made between the applicant and the\nentity that shall perform the review, approval, inspection, and compliance\ncertification, including arrangements made to pay for the costs thereof\nincluding the costs for any consultant services necessary due to the complex\nnature of such facilities. If the applicable city, town or village has adopted\nand incorporated the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code\nfor administration into its local electric, plumbing and building codes, the\napplicant may make a request pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section that\nthe board expressly authorize the exercise of the electric, plumbing and\nbuilding permit application, inspection and certification processes by such\ncity, town or village. (d) A list\nof all local ordinances, laws, resolutions, regulations, standards and other\nrequirements applicable to the construction or operation of the proposed major\nelectric generating facility (includes interconnection electric transmission\nlines and fuel gas transmission lines that are not subject to review under\narticle VII of the PSL) that are of a substantive nature, together with a\nstatement that the location of the facility as proposed conforms to all such\nlocal substantive requirements, except any that the applicant requests that the\nboard elect to not apply. Copies of zoning, flood plain and similar maps, tables and/or documents shall be included in the exhibit when such are\nreferenced in such local substantive requirements. Pursuant to PSL section\n168(3)(e), the board must find that the facility is designed to operate in\ncompliance with these local substantive requirements, all of which shall be\nbinding upon the applicant, unless the board elects to not apply them by\nfinding that, as applied to the proposed facility such are unreasonably\nburdensome in view of the existing technology or the needs of or costs to\nratepayers whether located inside or outside of such municipality. (e) A list of all local substantive\nrequirements required to be identified pursuant to subdivision (d) of this\nsection for which the applicant requests that the board elect to not apply them\nby finding that, as applied to the proposed facility such are unreasonably\nburdensome in view of the existing technology or the needs of or costs to\nratepayers whether located inside or outside of such municipality. For each\nlocal substantive requirement identified, a statement justifying the request\nshall be provided. The statement of justification shall show with facts and\nanalysis the degree of burden caused by the requirement, why the burden should\nnot reasonably be borne by the applicant, that the request cannot reasonably be\nobviated by design changes to the proposed facility, the request is the minimum\nnecessary, and the adverse impacts of granting the request are mitigated to the\nmaximum extent practicable. The statement shall include a demonstration: (1)\nfor requests grounded in the existing\ntechnology, that there are technological limitations (including governmentally\nimposed technological limitations) related to necessary facility component\nbulk, height, process or materials that make compliance by the applicant\ntechnically impossible, impractical or otherwise unreasonable; (2)\nfor requests grounded in factors of costs\nor economics (likely involving economic modeling), that the costs to consumers\nassociated with applying the local substantive requirement outweigh the\nbenefits of applying such provision; and\n(3)\nfor requests grounded in the needs of\nconsumers, that the needs of consumers for the facility outweigh the impacts on\nthe community that would result from refusal to apply the local substantive\nrequirement. (f) A list\nof all local ordinances, laws, resolutions, regulations, standards and other\nrequirements applicable to the interconnection to or use of water, sewer, telecommunication and steam lines in public rights of way that are of a\nprocedural nature. These local procedural requirements are not supplanted\nunless the board elects to not apply them by finding that, as applied to the\nproposed facility interconnections such are unreasonably burdensome in view of\nthe existing technology or the needs of or costs to ratepayers whether located\ninside or outside of such municipality. (g) A list of all local ordinances, laws, resolutions, regulations, standards and other requirements applicable to the\ninterconnection to or use of water, sewer, telecommunication and steam lines in\npublic rights of way that are of a substantive nature. These local substantive\nrequirements are not supplanted unless the board elects to not apply them by\nfinding that, as applied to the proposed facility interconnections such are\nunreasonably burdensome in view of the existing technology or the needs of or\ncosts to ratepayers whether located inside or outside of such\nmunicipality. (h) A list of all\nlocal procedural or substantive requirements required to be identified pursuant\nto subdivisions (f) and (g) of this section for which the applicant requests\nthat the board elect to not apply them by finding that, as applied to the\nproposed facility interconnections such are unreasonably burdensome in view of\nthe existing technology or the needs of or costs to ratepayers whether located\ninside or outside of such municipality. For each local procedural or\nsubstantive requirement identified, a statement justifying the request shall be\nprovided. The statement of justification shall show with facts and analysis the\ndegree of burden caused by the requirement, why the burden should not\nreasonably be borne by the applicant, that the request cannot reasonably be\nobviated by design changes to the proposed facility, the request is the minimum\nnecessary, and the adverse impacts of granting the request are mitigated to the\nmaximum extent practicable. The statement shall include a demonstration: (1)\nfor requests grounded in the existing\ntechnology, that there are technological limitations (including governmentally\nimposed technological limitations) related to necessary facility component\nbulk, height, process or materials that make compliance by the applicant\ntechnically impossible, impractical or otherwise unreasonable; (2)\nfor requests grounded in factors of costs\nor economics (likely involving economic modeling), that the costs to consumers\nassociated with applying the local substantive requirement outweigh the\nbenefits of applying such provision; and\n(3)\nfor requests grounded in the needs of\nconsumers, that the needs of consumers for the facility outweigh the impacts on\nthe community that would result from refusal to apply the local substantive\nrequirement. (i) A\nsummary table of all local substantive requirements required to be identified\npursuant to subdivisions (d) and (g) of this section in two columns listing the\nprovisions in the first column and a discussion or other showing demonstrating\nthe degree of compliance with the substantive provision in the second\ncolumn. (j) An identification of\nthe zoning designation or classification of all lands constituting the site of\nthe proposed facility and a statement of the language in the zoning ordinance\nor local law by which it is indicated that the proposed facility is a permitted\nuse at the proposed site. If the language of the zoning ordinance or local law\nindicates that the proposed facility is a permitted use at the proposed site\nsubject to the grant of a special exception, a statement of the criteria in the\nzoning ordinance or local law by which qualification for such a special\nexception is to be determined.
