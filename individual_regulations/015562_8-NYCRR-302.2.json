No money shall be refunded unless application for the refund is\nmade within one year after the end of term for which the tuition requested to\nbe refunded was paid to State University. The first day that classes are\noffered, as scheduled by the campus, shall be considered the first day of the\nsemester, quarter or other term, and the first week of classes for purposes of\nthis section, shall be deemed to have ended when seven calendar days, including\nthe first day of scheduled classes, have elapsed. (2)\nA tuition liability schedule for any term\nother than those listed in the schedule above shall be determined by the chief\nadministrative officer of each unit of State University subject to the approval\nof the chancellor of State University. (b) Exceptions. (1)\n\nThere shall be no tuition or fee\nliability established for a student who withdraws to enter military service\nprior to the end of an academic term for those courses in which he does not\nreceive academic credit. (2)\nA\nstudent who is dismissed for academic or disciplinary reasons prior to the end\nof an academic term shall be liable for all tuition and fees due for that\nterm. (3)\nA student who cancels his\nregistration at a unit of the State University and within the same term\nregisters at another unit of the State University, shall be entitled to full\ncredit for tuition and fees paid for that term. (4)\n\nTuition and fees collected in error, or\nin amounts in excess of the required amounts may be refunded. The request for\nrefund shall include the reason for and the amount of the refund. (5)\nA student who is receiving Veteran\n\nAdministration benefits under Public Law 550(82nd Congress-Act of July 16, 1952) and is enrolled in a nonaccredited program may not be charged on\nwithdrawal in excess of the approximate prorated portion of the total charges\nthat the length of the completed portion of the program bears to its total\nlength and shall be entitled to a refund of any amount paid in excess\nthereof. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding any\nother provisions for refund, when a student has withdrawn through circumstances\nbeyond the student's control, under conditions in which the denial of refund\nwould cause undue hardship, the chief administrative officer of the unit may, in his or her discretion, determine that no liability for tuition has been\nincurred by the student, provided the student has not completed more than one\nhalf of the term, has not received or will not receive academic credit for the\nterm, and that the request for refund is made within one year after the end of\nthe term in question. Such action, including the reason therefor, shall be in\nwriting. (c) Military\npersonnel withdrawing from any program or term because of changes of assignment\nbeyond their control and upon proper certification of such change from a base\neducation service officer or other appropriate military official shall be\ndeemed to have incurred no liability for tuition and fees due from the student, as opposed to tuition and fees paid by the Federal government on the student's\nbehalf.
