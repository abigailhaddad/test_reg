The\ndepartment reserves the right to inspect any site receiving fill. (d) Testing requirements for\nexcavated material as fill. Excavated material that is not otherwise excluded\nor exempt from regulation under this section must be sampled and analyzed\npursuant to subdivision (e) of this section if: (1)\nthe excavated material originates from a\nlocation within the City of New York unless the quantity of excavated material\ndoes not exceed 10 cubic yards from one site and the 10 cubic yards or less of\nmaterial does not exhibit historical evidence of contamination based on site\nuse, reported spill events, or visual and other indicators (odors, etc.) of\nchemical or physical contamination; or\n(2)\nthe excavated material originates from a\nlocation outside the City of New York and either one of the following occur: (i) there is historical evidence of\ncontamination based on site use, reported spill events, or visual and other\nindicators (odors, etc.) of chemical or physical contamination discovered prior\nto excavation; or\n(ii)\nvisual\nindication of chemical or physical contamination is discovered during\nexcavation. (e) Sampling and analysis requirements for excavated material as fill. (1)\n\nSample method and frequency. Samples must\nbe representative of the fill. The sampling program must be designed and\nimplemented by or under the direction of a qualified environmental professional\n(QEP), using Table 1 below as a minimum sampling frequency. Written\ndocumentation of the sampling program with certification from the QEP that\nsamples were representative of the fill must be retained for three years after\nthe sampling occurs and must be provided to the department upon request.
