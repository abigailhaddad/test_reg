  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-3.3 - Special rules for determining primary use location\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In applying the primary use location\nmethod of the hierarchy, a corporation must determine first if the type of\nreceipt must be sourced using the special rules in this section. The specific\ncriteria to apply the special rules may be met whether the digital product or\ndigital service is provided directly by the corporation or on behalf of the\ncorporation. The special rules apply to the receipts described in subdivisions\n(b) through (e) of this section. If a corporation meets the specific criteria\nto apply a special rule, but does not have sufficient information to apply the\nrule, the corporation should use the rules for reasonable approximation in\nsection\n4-3.5\nor\n4-3.6\nof this Subpart to apply the\nspecial rule. However, if the corporation does not have sufficient information\nto apply the rules for reasonable approximation to the special rule, then the\nspecial rule no longer applies. (b) Facilitation of in-person services. Services that are rendered to the body of\nan individual or in the physical presence of an individual and, based on the\nnature of the services, require the physical presence of an individual, are\nconsidered in-person services. Receipts from digital facilitation of the\nprovision of in-person services are apportioned under the special rule in this\nsubdivision. (1)\n\nDigital facilitation of the\nprovision of in-person services includes, but is not limited to, ride-sharing; facilitating ticket sales for live entertainment and athletic performances; and\nscheduling of in-person training or lessons. (2)\n\nThe primary use location of the\nfacilitation of in-person services is presumed to be the location where the\nin-person service is performed. (3)\n\nIn-person services do not include: (i) services that do not require significant in-person contact in order to perform, but nevertheless may include in-person contact, including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, financial and consulting services; and\n(ii)\nthe obligation to perform services or\nfund the performance of services that may or may not actually occur at an\nundetermined future date (e.g., facilitation of the purchase of insurance) is\nnot an in-person service, although significant in-person contact may ultimately\noccur when the service is actually performed. (c) Services related to tangible personal\nproperty. Receipts from digital services that include services related to\ntangible personal property are sourced under the special rule in this\nsubdivision. This includes commissions and other receipts related to the\nfacilitation of services related to tangible personal property. Receipts from\nthe facilitation of in-person services related to tangible personal property\nare apportioned under the special rule in this subdivision, rather than the\nspecial rule in subdivision (b) of this section for the facilitation of\nin-person services. (1)\n\nDigital services\nrelated to tangible personal property include, but are not limited to: computer\ntroubleshooting, software installation, and facilitation of the sale of\ntangible personal property. (2)\n\nThe\nprimary use location of services related to tangible personal property is\npresumed to be at the location where the property is received after the service\nis performed. (3)\n\nThe obligation to\nperform services or fund the performance of services that may or may not\nactually occur at an undetermined future date (e.g., warranty services, facilitation of the purchase of insurance) is not a service related to tangible\npersonal property, although a service may ultimately be performed on tangible\npersonal property. (d) Services related to real property. Receipts from digital services related to\nreal property, including commissions and other receipts related to the\nfacilitation of such services, are apportioned under the special rule in this\nsubdivision. Digital services related to real property include services that\nrelate to the improvement or maintenance of the property and services that\nrelate to the title, purchase, sale, rental, appraisal, assessment or basis in\nthe property. Receipts from the facilitation of in-person services related to\nreal property are apportioned under the special rule in this subdivision, rather than the special rule in subdivision (b) of this section for\nfacilitation of in-person services. (1)\n\nDigital services related to real property include, but are not limited to: security services, mortgage servicing, title searches and facilitating property\nor room rentals. (2)\n\nThe primary\nuse location of the digital service related to real property is presumed to be\nwhere the real property is located. (e) Sales of computer software at retail\nlocations. (1)\n\nReceipts from the sale of\nprewritten, non-customized computer software sold at a physical retail location\nthat sells more than one type of digital product and/or a combination of\ndigital products and other products, where the customer is physically present\nat the physical retail location at the time they take possession of the\nsoftware or right to download such software, are apportioned under the special\nrule in this subdivision. (2)\n\nWith\nrespect to receipts from software sold under the conditions of this special\nrule, the receipt is apportioned to the physical retail location where the\nsoftware is sold. Notes\nN.Y.
