(i) No commissioner, officer or employee of\nthe authority should: (a) accept other\nemployment which will impair his independence of judgment in the exercise of\nhis official duties; (b) accept\nemployment or engage in any business or professional activity which will\nrequire him to disclose confidential information which he has gained by reason\nof his official position or authority; (c) disclose confidential information\nacquired by him in the course of his official duties nor use such information\nto further his personal interests; (d) use or attempt to use his official\nposition to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for himself or\nothers; (e) engage in any\ntransaction as representative or agent of the authority with any business\nentity in which he has a direct or indirect financial interest that might\nreasonably tend to conflict with the proper discharge of his official\nduties; (f) by his conduct give\nreasonable basis for the impression that any person can improperly influence\nhim or unduly enjoy his favor in the performance of his official duties, or\nthat he is affected by the kinship, rank, position or influence of any party or\nperson. (ii)\nA\ncommissioner, officer or employee of the authority should: (a) abstain from making personal investments\nin enterprises which he has reason to believe may be directly involved in\ndecisions to be made by him or which will otherwise create substantial conflict\nbetween his duty in the public interest and his private interest; (b) endeavor to pursue a course of conduct\nwhich will not raise suspicion among the public that he is likely to be engaged\nin acts that are in violation of his trust. (iii)\n\nAnyone involved in the negotiation of\ncontracts shall ensure that all statements, communications and representations\nto contractor representatives are accurate and truthful. (iv)\n\nGreat care must be exercised to ensure\nthe proper recording and charging of all costs to the appropriate account, regardless of the status of the budget for that account.

(b) Protest\nprocedures. The protest procedures set-forth herein apply to both sealed\nbids and negotiated procurements. (1)\n\nPre-bid opening protests. If a bidder/proponent can demonstrate that the contract\ndocuments issued by the authority are unduly exclusionary and restrictive or\nthat Federal, State or local laws or regulations have been violated during the\ncourse of the procurement, then the bidder/proponent may seek a review by the\nexecutive director or his appointed representative, at 181 Ellicott Street, Buffalo, NY 14203. Protests shall be clearly identified as Protests and\nsubmitted in writing as early as possible but no later than five business days\nbefore bid opening. Within four business days after receipt of a pre-bid\nprotest, the executive director shall make one of the determinations listed in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nPost-bid opening protests. A protest to the acceptance or rejection of any or of all\noffers or bids to a contract, or to the award thereof, or to any such action\nproposed or intended by the authority must be received in writing by the\nexecutive director no later than five business days after the protesting party\nfirst learned of the required board action, or reasonably ought to have learned\nof the required board action or, if the board action is not required, any\nproposed or intended action to which he/she protests. (3)\n\nIn the event the protestor alleges that\nthe executive director or the representative appointed by the executive\ndirector to serve as decision-maker for the particular protest, engaged in\nimproper conduct during the subject procurement, the general counsel shall\nserve as the decision-maker. In the event it has been alleged that the general\ncounsel has engaged in improper conduct during the subject procurement, either\nthe executive director or the Director of Engineering shall serve as the\ndecision-maker. (4)\n\nRulings on\nprotests. Within four business days, the executive director shall\nrender one of the following determinations: (i) Protest is overruled. (ii)\n\nProtest is substantiated. Executive\ndirector shall issue instructions to remedy issues relating to the\nprotest. (iii)\n\nProcurement activity\nis suspended until written notification by the executive director. Such\ndetermination shall be in writing and shall provide at a minimum a general\nresponse to each material issue raised in the protest. All documents submitted\nby the protestor and/or authority staff and reviewed by the decision-maker in\nthe reaching of a determination shall form and be retained by the authority as\nthe formal record of the dispute resolution process. The issuance of the\nforegoing determination is the authority's final decision of the dispute. All\ninterested parties shall be notified of any protests that are filed. The\nauthority shall refrain from awarding a contract within five business days of\nthe date of a decision rendered by the executive director regarding a protest, unless the authority determines that: (a) the\nitems to be procured are urgently required; (b) delivery or performance will be unduly\ndelayed by failure to make a prompt award; (c) failure to make a prompt award will\notherwise cause undue harm to the authority or the Federal\ngovernment. (5)\n\nProtestor's appeal to Federal or State\nagencies. In the event Federal or State funds are participating in the\nprocurement, then the protestor may seek a review by the appropriate funding\nagency. The Federal Transit Administration will only consider a protest if the\nauthority: (i) does not have protest\nprocedures; (ii)\nhas not complied\nwith its protest procedures; or\n(iii)\nhas not reviewed the protest when given\nthe opportunity to do so. The Federal Transit Administration will exercise\ndiscretionary jurisdiction over those appeals involving issues important to the\n\nFederal Transit Administration's overall public transportation program. Protestors shall file such a protest not later than five\nbusiness days after a final decision is rendered under the authority's protest\nprocedure. In instances where the protestor alleges that the authority failed\nto make a final determination on the protest, protestors shall file a protest\nwith the appropriate agency not later than five business days after the\nprotestor knew or should have known of authority's failure to render a final\ndetermination on the protest.
