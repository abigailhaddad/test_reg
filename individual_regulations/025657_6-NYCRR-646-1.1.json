(1)\n\nNo person shall\nconstruct, erect, place, alter, modify, enlarge, or expand any dock, wharf or\nmooring on waters of Lake George without having first obtained a permit from\nthe commission; and\n(2)\n\nNo person\nshall use or maintain a dock, wharf or mooring on waters of Lake George unless\nthe dock, wharf or mooring is registered with the commission, and the fees\nrequired pursuant to Subpart 645-7 are paid in full when due. (b) Annual registration. Each\ndock, wharf and mooring shall, on or before April 1st of each year, be\nregistered with the commission on such forms as the commission may prescribe. Such forms shall include certification by the owner or operator of the number\nof vessels to be berthed at the facility and the names of the owners thereof, including the vessels that will be registered to the owner or the owner's\nimmediate family, and the vessels that will be registered to other\npersons. (c) Special requirements. All new docks, wharfs and moorings shall comply with the provisions of this\nparagraph: (1)\n\nNo dock or wharf shall be\nconstructed in a configuration other than a straight pier, T, L, U, E or\nF-shaped. For the convenience of the regulated community, the following\nspecific configurations are authorized configurations: Image\n(These configurations shall not be interpreted to\nindicate which side of the structure should be connected to land.)\n(2)\n\nNo dock or wharf shall be\nconstructed so as to exceed the following offshore distance criteria: (i) no dock or wharf may extend offshore for\nmore than 40 feet beyond the mean low-water mark where the wharf intersects the\nmean low-water mark; (ii)\nin\nstreams, no dock or wharf may extend more than 20 percent of the width of the\nstream at the point of construction; and\n(iii)\nno dock, wharf or mooring shall be\nconstructed or placed so as to extend offshore more than 100 feet from the mean\nhigh water mark. (3)\n\nNo\ndock, wharf or mooring shall be constructed or placed so as to interfere with\nnormal navigation or reasonable access to adjacent docks, wharfs, moorings or\nlands. (4)\n\nThe maximum surface area\nof any dock or wharf shall be 700 square feet, including any walkway. For the\npurpose of computing the maximum surface area, no portion of the structure\nshall be included within the computation which extends upland of the mean\nhigh-water mark, and the minimum allowable width of any dock, wharf, pier, lateral projection or finger shall be two feet. (5)\n\nThe maximum width of any pier shall be\neight feet. (6)\n\nThe maximum width\nof any dock or wharf, including all lateral projections, shall be 40\nfeet. (7)\n\nThe maximum number of\ndocks, wharfs or moorings permitted per lakefront lot or parcel shall be\nlimited as follows: (i) 45 to 65 feet of\nlakefront--one dock or wharf constructed as a straight pier (a minimum of 45\nfeet is required for the construction of a wharf); (ii)\n66 to 150 feet of lakefront--one dock or\nwharf constructed as a straight pier, T, L or U-shaped, plus one\nmooring; (iii)\n151 to 250 feet of\nlakefront--two docks or wharfs constructed in any combination of straight pier, T, F, L or U-shaped, or one E-shaped wharf, plus two moorings; (iv)\n251 to 500 feet of lakefront--three\ndocks or wharfs constructed of any combination of straight pier, T, L, U or\nF-shaped, or two E-shaped wharfs, plus three moorings; or\n(v) 501 or more feet of lakefront--four docks\nor wharfs constructed as a straight pier, T, F, E, L or U-shaped wharf, plus\nfour moorings, and one additional dock or wharf plus one additional mooring for\neach additional 150 feet of lakefront. In determining the maximum number of permitted docks, wharfs or moorings, the commission may review any subdivision of land created\non or after the effective date of these regulations [June 3, 1988] which\ninvolved the lot or parcel in issue to determine the maximum number of docks, wharfs or moorings permitted and base such number upon the total footage of\nlakefront prior to the subdivision. (8)\n\nNo structure shall be constructed on a\ndock, wharf or mooring which exceeds 16 feet in height above the mean\nhigh-water mark and which is not in compliance with local zoning. (9)\n\nAll crib wharfs shall be of the open crib\ntype. (10)\n\nNo dock or wharf shall\nbe constructed unless designed to withstand forces of flowing water and wave\nwashes. (11)\n\nEvery dock or wharf\nconstructed shall have a minimum setback of 20 feet from the adjacent property\nline extended into the lake on the same axis as the property line runs onshore\nwhere it meets the lake, or at a right angle to the mean high-water mark, whichever results in the greater setback. This provision shall control over the\nprovisions of section\n646-1.4\n(k) of this Subpart. (12)\n\nMoorings\nshall be placed so that vessels moored to them, at the full swing of their\nmooring or anchor line, will be no closer than 20 feet to the projection of the\nproperty lines extended into the lake along the axis of the property lines as\nthey intersect the lake, or a line extended at a right angle to the mean\nhigh-water mark, whichever results in the greater setback. Moorings shall not\nbe placed so that the full swing of the vessel extends more than 100 feet\noffshore from the mean high-water mark. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
