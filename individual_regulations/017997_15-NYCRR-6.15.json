(2)\n\nOne accident shall\nnot be counted for the purposes of re-examination if the person successfully\ncompletes a motor vehicle accident prevention course approved by the\ncommissioner. Only one such course may be taken during an 18-month period for\nthe purpose of this paragraph. (3)\n\nUpon the failure of the licensee to successfully complete a re-examination, the\ncommissioner shall take such reasonable action as may be required. Such action\nmay consist of imposing restrictions on the use of the license of such person, suspending such license for a definite or indefinite period, or revoking such\nlicense. The commissioner may revoke or suspend for a indefinite period the\nlicense of any person who after reasonable notice fails or refuses to submit to\nsuch re-examination. No person whose license has been suspended or revoked\nunder this section shall be qualified to operate a bus until such person\nsuccessfully completes a re-examination.

Any further action taken\nagainst such driver's license shall be in the discretion of the motor vehicle\nlicense examiner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
