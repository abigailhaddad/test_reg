(c) Privies adjacent to any well. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit or receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 50 feet of any well of the public water supply of the South Huntington Water District. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of any well of the public water supply of the South Huntington Water District.

(4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles shall be removed and the receptacles cleaned and disinfected as often as may be found necessary in order to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal, the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises or of the adjoining premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specially ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid receptacles shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits at a depth of not less than 12 inches below the surface of the ground and in such manner as to effectually prevent them being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance not less than 500 feet from any well of the public water supply of the South Huntington Water District. (6)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local condition, the excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any well of the public water supply of the South Huntington Water District, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.

(2)\n\nNo human excreta and no compost or other matter containing human excreta shall be thrown, placed or allowed to escape into any well nor to be thrown, placed, piled or spread upon the surface of the ground within 200 feet of any well of the public water supply of the South Huntington Water District, nor shall such human excreta or compost or other matter containing human excreta be buried in the soil at a less depth than 12 inches below the surface of the ground nor within a distance of 200 feet of any well of the public water supply of the South Huntington Water District, and no manure or compost of any kind shall be placed, piled or spread upon the ground within a distance of 75 feet of any well of the public water supply of the South Huntington Water District.
