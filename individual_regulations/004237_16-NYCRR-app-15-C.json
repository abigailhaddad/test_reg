  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app 15-C\nState Regulations\nSAMPLE QUESTIONS FOR DEPOSIT REQUESTS\nAn applicant for telephone service shall be asked the following\nsix questions: 1. Employer's name, address and telephone number and applicant's position. 2. Applicant's length of time with present\nemployer. If applicant has less than two years with present employer, previous\nemployment should be obtained or reason(s) for not being previously\nemployed. 3. Whether the applicant\nowns or rents his place of residence. If renting, the length of occupancy of\nthe premises should be determined. 4. Bank account(s)-types and where\nlocated. 5. Whether the applicant\nhas credit cards, charge accounts, loans or other credit references. 6. Whether the applicant has sources of\nincome other than from employment. The following guidelines for determining what are positive and\nnegative answers should be used: 1. If\nthe applicant is employed, that is considered a positive answer. The\napplicant's position is of importance only to the extent that it helps identify\nthe applicant during a credit check with the employer. Position should not be\ngiven any weight since it could result in discriminatory treatment of certain\nindividuals who are forced to take low paying positions. Employment of a\nspouse, with whom the applicant is residing, would be considered equivalent to\nemployment of the applicant. 2a. If\nthe applicant has been employed by the present employer for two years, that is\nconsidered a positive answer. 2b. If the applicant has been employed by the present employer for less than two\nyears, but has been employed by only one other employer during the past two\nyears, that is considered a positive answer. 2c. If the applicant has been employed by the\npresent employer for less than two years and has no previous employment having\nrecently graduated from high school or college or having recently been\ndischarged from military duty, or having been recently widowed, separated or\ndivorced, the response should be considered positive. 3. If the applicant owns his or her home, or\nhas occupied the premises for two or more years, or has occupied the premises\nand the preceding residence for two or more years, that should be considered a\npositive answer. [A utility may choose not to require a deposit of homeowners\nfor that reason alone provided it applies that standard uniformly.]\n4. If the applicant has had a bank account\nfor more than one year, which is substantiated by the bank to be in good\nstanding, that should be considered a positive answer. 5. If the applicant has credit cards, charge\naccounts, or has been extended credit by a bank, commercial concern or\nindividual, it would be considered a positive response unless subsequent\ninvestigation proved the applicant unworthy of credit. 6. If the applicant indicates other sources\nof income such as stocks, real estate, welfare, pension, alimony, etc., this\nwould be considered a positive answer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
