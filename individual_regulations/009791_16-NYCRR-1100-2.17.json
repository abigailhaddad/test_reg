Tit. 16 §§ 1100-2.17 - Exhibit 16: Effect on Transportation\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 16 shall contain: (a) A conceptual site plan, drawn at an\nappropriate scale, depicting all facility site driveway and roadway\nintersections, showing: (1)\n\nHorizontal and\nvertical geometry, the number of approach lanes, the lane widths, shoulder\nwidths, traffic control devices by approaches, and sight distances; and\n(2)\n\nFor wind facilities, access\nroad locations and widths, including characterizations of road intersection\nsuitability. (b) A\ndescription of the pre-construction characteristics of the public roadways in\nthe vicinity of the facility, as determined pursuant to the pre-application\nmeeting(s) required pursuant to section 1100- 1.3(a) of this Part, including: (1)\nA review of existing data on vehicle\ntraffic, use levels and accidents; (2)\nA review of transit facilities and\nroutes, including areas of school bus service; (3)\n\nAn identification of potential approach\nand departure routes to and from the facility site for police, fire, ambulance\nand other emergency vehicles; and\n(4)\nA review of available load bearing and\nstructural rating information for expected facility traffic routes (existing\nculverts to be traversed by construction vehicles shall also be considered in\nthe analyses). (c) An\nestimate of the trip generation characteristics of the facility during\nconstruction, including: (1)\n\nFor each major\nphase of construction, and for the operation phase, an estimate of the number\nand frequency of vehicle trips, including an estimation of daily trips\n(identifying whether trips will occur during day or night) by size, weight and\ntype of vehicle; (2)\n\nFor major cut\nor fill activity (spoil removal or deposition at the facility site and affected\ninterconnection areas), a separate estimate of the number and frequency of\nvehicle trips, including time of day and day of week arrival and departure\ndistribution, and including a delineation of approach and departure routes, by\nsize, weight and type of vehicle; and\n(3)\n\nAn identification of approach and\ndeparture routes to and from the facility site for construction workers and\nemployees of the facility. (d) An analysis and evaluation of the traffic\nand transportation impacts of the facility, including: (1)\n\nFor wind facilities, a discussion of\nprojected future traffic conditions with and without the facility, the analysis\nto be conducted separately for the peak construction impacts of the facility\nand for the typical operations of the completed facility, including in\ncongested urbanized areas a calculation and comparison of the level of service\nfor each representative intersection, giving detail for each turning\nmovement; (2)\n\nAn evaluation of the\nadequacy of the road system to accommodate the projected traffic, the analysis\nto be conducted separately for the peak construction impacts of the facility\n(for both wind and solar facilities) and for the typical operations of the\ncompleted facility (analyses to be provided only for operational wind\ngeneration) and to include an identification of the extent and duration of\ntraffic interferences during construction of the facility and any\ninterconnections; (3)\n\nAn assessment\nof over-size load deliveries, and the adequacy of roadway systems to\naccommodate oversize and over-weight vehicles, improvements necessary to\naccommodate oversize or overweight deliveries, impacts associated with such\nimprovements, and mitigation measures appropriate to minimize such impacts; and\n(4)\n\nAn identification and\nevaluation of practicable mitigation measures regarding traffic and\ntransportation impacts, including time restrictions, the use of alternative\ntechnologies, the construction of physical roadway improvements, the\ninstallation of new traffic control devices, and the repair of local roads or\nother features due to damage by heavy equipment or construction activities\nduring construction or operation of the facility. (e) An analysis and evaluation of the impacts\nof the facility on airports and airstrips, railroads, buses and any other mass\ntransit systems in the vicinity of the facility, as determined pursuant to the\npreapplication meeting(s) held pursuant to section 1100-1.3(a) of this Part. The analysis and evaluation shall include impacts on military training and\nfrequent military operations in the National Airspace System and Special Use\n\nAirspace designated by the FAA. (f) If any construction or alteration is proposed that requires a Notice of\n\nProposed Construction to be submitted to the administrator of the FAA in\naccordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 77 (see section\n1100-15.1(h)(1)(i) of this Part): (1)\n\nThe\napplication shall include a statement that the applicant has: (i) Received an informal Department of\n\nDefense review of the proposed construction or alteration in accordance with 32\n\nCode of Federal Regulations section 211.7 (see section 1100-15.1(f)(1)(ii) of\nthis Part); or\n(ii)\n\nReceived a\nformal Department of Defense review of the proposed construction or alteration\nin accordance with 32 Code of Federal Regulations section 211.6 (see section\n1100-15.1(f)(1)(i) of this Part). (2)\n\nIf such construction or alteration of a\nwind facility is proposed to be located: (i) Within twelve (12) miles of the nearest point of the nearest runway of a\ncommercial service, cargo service, reliever or general aviation (public use)\nairport or a military airport with at least one (1) runway more than three\nthousand two hundred (3,200) feet in actual length; or\n(ii)\n\nWithin six (6) miles of the nearest\npoint of the nearest runway of a commercial service, cargo service, reliever or\ngeneral aviation (public use) airport or a military airport with its longest\nrunway no more than three thousand two hundred (3,200) feet in actual length; or\n(iii)\n\nWithin three (3) miles of\nthe nearest point of the nearest point of the nearest landing and takeoff area\nof a commercial service, cargo service, reliever or general aviation (public\nuse) heliport or military heliport: (a) The\napplication shall include a statement that the applicant has consulted with the\noperators of such airports and heliports that are non-military facilities, has\nprovided a detailed map and description of such construction or alteration to\nsuch operators, and has requested review of and comment on such construction or\nalteration by such operators; and\n(b) The application shall include a statement\nthat the applicant has provided a detailed map and description of such\nconstruction or alteration to the operators (base commanders) of such airports\nand heliports that are military facilities.
