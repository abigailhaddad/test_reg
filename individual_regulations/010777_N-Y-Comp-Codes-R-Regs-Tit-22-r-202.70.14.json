  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 r. 202.70.14 - Disclosure Disputes\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf the court's Part Rules address\ndiscovery disputes, those Part Rules will govern discovery disputes in a\npending case. If the court's Part Rules are silent with respect to discovery\ndisputes, the following Rule will apply. Discovery disputes are preferred to be\nresolved through court confer- ence as opposed to motion practice. Counsel must\nconsult with one another in a good faith effort to resolve all disputes about\ndisclosure. See Section\n202.7. If counsel are unable to\nresolve any disclosure dispute in this fashion, counsel for the moving party\nshall submit a let- ter to the court not exceeding three single-spaced pages\noutlining the nature of the dispute and requesting a telephone conference. Such\na letter must include a representation that the party has conferred with\nopposing counsel in a good faith effort to resolve the issues raised in the\nletter or shall indicate good cause why no such consultation occurred. Not\nlater than four business days after receiving such a let- ter, any affected\nopposing party or non-party shall submit a responsive letter not exceeding\nthree single-spaced pages. After the submission of letters, the court will\nschedule a telephone or in-court conference with counsel. The court or the\ncourt's law clerks will attempt to address the matter through a telephone\nconference where possible. The failure of counsel to comply with this rule may\nresult in a motion being held in abeyance until the court has an opportunity to\nconference the matter. If the parties need to make a record, they will still\nhave the opportunity to submit a formal motion. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\nr. 202.70.14. Amended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 29, 2015/Volume XXXVII, Issue 17, eff. 4/1/2015\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
