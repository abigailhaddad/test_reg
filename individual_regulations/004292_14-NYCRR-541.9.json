  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 541.9 - Hospital forensics committee procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The hospital forensics committee shall\nmeet to evaluate the current mental condition of a defendant and to make\nrecommendations to the clinical director at the request of the treatment\nteam. (b) The hospital forensics\ncommittee shall meet within five calendar days of receipt of a request by the\ndefendant's treatment team that an application be made for a transfer order, furlough order or release order, or that administrative privileges as described\nin section\n541.5\nof this Part be granted. The\ntreatment team may make the request on its own initiative or at the request of\nthe defendant or the defendant's representative. However, the committee may\nrefuse to consider a request made within six months of a previous denial of a\nsimilar request. (c) The committee\nshall notify the defendant, the defendant's attorney and the Mental Health\n\nInformation Service of its meeting at least three calendar days in advance of\nthe meeting. The defendant, the defendant's attorney and the Mental Health\n\nInformation Service may attend the examination, but do not have the right to\nparticipate. (d) The hospital\nforensics committee shall consider the defendant's records, the recommendations\nof the treatment team and the report of a current psychiatric examination. A\npsychiatrist or psychologist on the committee may examine the defendant or the\ncommittee may conduct a joint examination. (e) Within five calendar days of the meeting, the committee shall make a written recommendation to the clinical director\nregarding the defendant's current clinical condition and whether a specific\napplication would be appropriate in light of the criteria described in the\nfollowing subdivisions. The recommendation need not be unanimous. If one member\nof the committee disagrees, he or she shall so notify the clinical director, in\nwriting. (f) In evaluating the\ndefendant's current mental condition, the committee shall consider whether the\ndefendant has a dangerous mental disorder, is not dangerous but has a mental\nillness for which inpatient care and treatment is necessary, or is not mentally\nill. (g) In evaluating the merits\nof any request for administrative privileges, the committee shall consider\nwhether such privileges would be clinically beneficial to the defendant and\nwhether, in its opinion, such privileges could be granted without endangering\nanother person or persons within or without the facility or without rendering\nan escape attempt likely. (h) In\nevaluating the merits of any request that the Director of Forensic Services\napply for a transfer order, the committee shall consider whether transfer to a\nnonsecure facility is consistent with the public safety and welfare of the\ncommunity and the defendant and is warranted by the defendant's clinical\ncondition. It shall also consider whether the defendant's behavior is such that\ntransfer would jeopardize the safety of other patients or staff at a nonsecure\nfacility, and whether such transfer would render an escape attempt\nlikely. (i) In evaluating the\nmerits of any request that the Director of Forensic Services apply for a\nfurlough order, the committee shall consider whether furlough would be\nclinically beneficial and whether the issuance of such order would be\nconsistent with the public safety and welfare of the community. The committee\nshall also consider whether the patient would pose an immediate danger to\nanother person or persons if allowed outside the facility or would fail to\nreturn on time. It shall also recommend the duration of the furlough, the\nperiod of time for which the furlough order should remain outstanding and any\nconditions or limitations on the exercise of furlough privileges. (j) In evaluating the merits of any request\nthat the Director of Forensic Services apply for a release order, the committee\nshall consider whether the defendant is mentally ill, in need of care and\ntreatment in a hospital, lacks the judgment necessary to understand such need, and would either be unable to live outside the hospital with the help of family\nor friends or would pose a danger to himself or others. The committee shall\nalso consider the conditions which would be necessary and appropriate if a\nrelease order were to be issued. (k) The clinical director shall review the\ncommittee's written recommendation. If the opinion of the committee is not\nunanimous, or if the clinical director disagrees with it, he or she may obtain\nanother psychiatric examination of the defendant. If the clinical director\ndetermines that an application for a transfer order, a retention order (if\napplied for in conjunction with a transfer order) or a release order is\nappropriate for the defendant, he or she shall submit such recommendation to\nthe Director of Forensic Services within 10 days of the receipt of the hospital\nforensic committee's written recommendation. If the clinical director\ndetermines that a retention order is appropriate for the defendant, he or she\nshall apply for such order in accordance with the provisions of section\n541.4\nof this Part. (l) The Director of Forensic Services shall\nhave responsibility for applying to the court for a furlough order, transfer\norder, retention order which is applied for in conjunction with a transfer\norder, or release order. If the recommendations of the committee and the\nclinical director are not unanimous, or if he or she disagrees with them, the\n\nDirector of Forensic Services may designate another psychiatrist or\npsychologist to examine the defendant. (m) In the event the defendant's treatment\nteam becomes aware of a change in his or her condition that would warrant a\ndiscontinuation of administrative privileges, withdrawal of an application for\na furlough order, transfer order or release order, or would make application\nfor a revocation of such order appropriate, the treatment team shall so notify\nthe clinical director, who shall immediately notify the Director of Forensic\n\nServices. The physician treating the defendant or the clinical director may\nimmediately suspend administrative privileges in the event of an\nemergency. (n) If the Director of\n\nForensic Services decides to grant administrative privileges or to apply for a\ncourt order, he shall so notify the district attorney, the defendant, counsel\nfor the defendant and the Mental Health Information Service; he shall apply to\nthe court for a furlough order, transfer order, retention order or release\norder following the procedures described in sections 541.4 and\n541.6\n-541.8 of this\n\nPart. (o) If the court authorizes\nthe discharge or release of a defendant confined in a secure facility, the\n\nDirector of Forensic Services shall, at least four days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, in advance of the discharge or release, deliver written\nnotice to all of the following: (1)\nthe\ndistrict attorney; (2)\nthe police\ndepartment having jurisdiction of the area to which the defendant is to be\ndischarged or released; and\n(3)\nany\nother person designated by the court.
