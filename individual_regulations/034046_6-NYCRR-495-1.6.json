As of January 1, 2027, GIE\nowners must establish and maintain a current and complete GIE inventory of each\nGIE device that uses a covered insulating gas. The GIE inventory will include\nthe following information: (1)\nGIE device\ninformation, including the following for each GIE device in the inventory; (i) manufacturer name and date of\nmanufacture; (ii)\nmanufacturer\nserial number or a unique identification number if the inventory includes more\nthan one GIE with the same manufacturer serial number; (iii)\ndate purchased, date acquired, or best\nestimate thereof, and location information, including if it is under or above\nground; (iv)\nGIE type, seal type\n(hermetic or non-hermetic), nameplate capacity, voltage capacity (in\nkilovolts), short-circuit rating (kiloampere); and\n(v) the name, GWP20, and amount (in pounds)\nof each covered insulating gas when the device was acquired, at activation, and\nfor any additional dates, starting the effective date of this Part, on which it\nwas added to the device. Measurement procedures should follow those used in\n495-1.6(b) of this Part. (2)\n\nOperational and ownership status: (i) Dates as to when the GIE device was\nactive or changed operational status during the data year and for hermetically\nsealed GIE, when the device was connected through busbars or cables to an\nelectrical power system. (ii)\n\nDates\nand types of actions that result in GIE being added or removed from the GIE\ninventory in the data year such as due to a change in ownership status. A GIE\nshall be considered as \"removed from regular use\" if it has not been active for\nfive consecutive years or it is made inactive so it can be removed from the GIE\nOwner's GIE Inventory such as to be disposed of or transferred to a new owner. A GIE shall be considered \"transferred while in use\" when the GIE device is\nremoved from a GIE owner's inventory without being taken out of active service\n(e.g., transferred to a new GIE owner while remaining in place and continuing\noperation). (iii)\n\nFor each GIE\ndevice that is jointly owned, each GIE owner's name as well as equity share and\nGIE Owner Share as estimated per section 95354(a)(7)(B) of\ntitle 17\nof the\n\nCalifornia Code of Regulations incorporated by reference herein, per section\n495-1.15 of this Part. (3)\n\nFailures and Repair information: (i) Name or description of any\nSF\n6\n-containing replacement parts installed during the\ndata year and the SF\n6\ncapacity and manufacturer serial\nnumber. (ii)\n\nThe date, time, and\nlocation of any failures that resulted in the addition of new\nSF\n6\nGIE after the phasedown date in section 495-1.4 of\nthis Part pursuant to section 495-1.10(b) of this Part and an explanation of\nthe cause of the failure, including, in cases of imminent failure, the\ncircumstances that led the GIE owner to believe failure was imminent, and the\ntimeframe within which the GIE owner expected the GIE device to\nfail. (b) Insulating Gas Inventory. As of January 1, 2027, GIE owners must establish and\nmaintain a current and complete inventory of all covered gas containers and gas\ncarts that contain covered insulating gas as well as covered insulating gas\ntransferred out of GIE devices. This includes GIE that is \"removed from regular\nuse\" per section 495-1.6(a)(2)(ii) of this Part. The GIE owner is responsible\nfor ensuring that gas, gas containers, and gas carts are accounted for and that\nmeasurement devices are calibrated consistent with the procedures established\nin sections 95354(b)-(m) of\ntitle 17\nof the California Code of Regulations\nincorporated by reference herein, per section 495-1.15 of this Part. The\nfollowing information must be included in the inventory: (1)\n\nThe unique identification information for\neach gas container or cart. (2)\n\nThe\nname, GWP20, and amount in pounds of each covered insulating gas in each gas\ncontainer or cart. (3)\n\nDates and\nthe amount of gas transferred into or out of GIE devices including when\n\"removed from regular use\". (4)\n\nThe\nmethods used to determine weights and volumes pursuant to the procedures\nreferred to in section 95354(b)-(m) of\ntitle 17\nof the California Code of\n\nRegulations incorporated by reference herein, per section 495-1.15 of this\n\nPart.
