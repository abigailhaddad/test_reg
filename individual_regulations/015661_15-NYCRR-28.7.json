  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 28.7 - Required records, audit procedures and refunds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. IRP registrants in this State\nmust maintain records on which the registration application is based. Such\nrecords must be maintained through three succeeding mileage reporting periods. The department may perform an audit of such records at any time. Advance notice\nwill be given by the department and the audit will be conducted during normal\nbusiness hours. If such records are not available in New York and auditors must\nbe sent elsewhere, the registrant may be required to reimburse all travel\nexpenses incurred in the performance of the audit. Upon completion of an audit\nthe carrier will be billed for any deficiency in fees due and owing to this\n\nState or notified of any overpayment of fees as determined by the audit. Although other member jurisdictions will be notified of inaccuracies found by\nthis department's auditors, it is the responsibility of each jurisdiction to\nbill such registrant for any deficiencies or to provide refund procedures for\nany additional amounts which may have been paid. No deficiency assessment or\ncredit claim may be made for any period for which records are no longer\nrequired to be kept. Failure to maintain adequate records for vehicles\nregistered in the registrant's fleet during the reporting period may subject\nthe registrant to full fee assessment for each vehicle unless satisfactory\nevidence of nonuse is presented. (b) Required documents. Records which must be\nkept by the registrant include driver's daily logs, and/or other daily trip\nrecord. In addition, monthly, quarterly and yearly mileage summaries prepared\nfrom the daily trip records must be maintained. Summary miles must be broken\ndown by vehicle, state and fleet. A trip record must contain the following\ninformation: (1)\ntrip date (starting and\nending); (2)\ntrip origin and all\ndestinations in \"city, state\" format; (3)\nmajor routes traveled; (4)\ntotal trip miles; (5)\nmileage by jurisdictions; (6)\nvehicle unit number or vehicle\nidentification number (VIN); (7)\nvehicle fleet number (if more than one fleet); (8)\nregistrant's name; (9)\nbeginning and ending distance meter\nreadings (i.e., odometer, hubometer); (10)\ndriver's name and/or signature. The registrant must retain all records set forth in this\nsubdivision for a period of at least six years. (c) [Reserved]\n(d) Audit results. Results of audits will be\ndistributed to the registrant and to the other IRP jurisdictions the registrant\nwas authorized to travel in. If the audit results in a net amount due to the\nregistrant, the net amount will automatically be refunded to the registrant. If\nthe audit results in a net amount owed by the registrant, the registrant must\npay the amount owned before processing any other IRP transactions. (e) Jurisdictional fee changes. Changes to\njurisdictional fees due to audit results will be distributed or collected from\nother IRP jurisdictions using the IRP clearinghouse. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n28.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
