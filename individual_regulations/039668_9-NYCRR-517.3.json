  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 517.3 - Exclusionary rules and related matters concerning self-incrimination, search and seizure, and eyewitness identification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Privilege concerning compulsory\nself-incrimination. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. The\nprivileges against self-incrimination provided by the\n\nFifth\n\nAmendment to the\n\nConstitution of the United States and Military Law, section 130.31 are\napplicable only to evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature. The\nprivilege most beneficial to the individual asserting the privilege shall be\napplied. (2)\n\nStanding. (i) In general. The privilege of a witness to\nrefuse to respond to a question the answer to which may tend to incriminate the\nwitness is a personal one that the witness may exercise or waive at the\ndiscretion of the witness. (ii)\n\nJudicial advice. If a witness who is apparently uninformed of the privileges\nunder this subdivision appears likely to incriminate himself or herself, the\nmilitary judge should advise the witness of the right to decline to make any\nanswer that might tend to incriminate the witness and that any\nself-incriminating answer the witness might make can later be used as evidence\nagainst the witness. Counsel for any party or for the witness may request the\nmilitary judge to so advise a witness provided that such a request is made out\nof the hearing of the witness and, except in a special court-martial without a\nmilitary judge, the members. Failure to so advise a witness does not make the\ntestimony of the witness inadmissible. (3)\n\nExercise of the privilege. If a witness\nstates that the answer to a question may tend to incriminate him or her, the\nwitness may not be required to answer unless facts and circumstances are such\nthat no answer the witness might make to the question could have the effect of\ntending to incriminate the witness or that the witness has, with respect to the\nquestion, waived the privilege against self-incrimination. A witness may not\nassert the privilege if the witness is not subject to criminal penalty as a\nresult of an answer by reason of immunity, running of the statute of\nlimitations, or similar reason. (i) Immunity\ngenerally. The minimum grant of immunity adequate to overcome the privilege is\nthat which under either N.Y.R.C.M. 704 or other proper authority provides that\nneither the testimony of the witness nor any evidence obtained from the\ntestimony may be used against the witness at any subsequent trial other than in\na prosecution for perjury, false swearing, the making of a false official\nstatement, or failure to comply with an order to testify after the military\njudge has ruled that the privilege may not be asserted by reason of\nimmunity. (ii)\n\nNotification of\nimmunity or leniency. When a prosecution witness before a court-martial has\nbeen granted immunity or leniency in exchange for testimony, the grant shall be\nreduced to writing and shall be served on the accused prior to arraignment or\nwithin a reasonable time before the witness testifies. If notification is not\nmade as required by this subdivision, the military judge may grant a\ncontinuance until notification is made, prohibit or strike the testimony of the\nwitness, or enter such other order as may be required. (4)\n\nWaiver by a witness. A witness who\nanswers a question without having asserted the privilege against\nself-incrimination and thereby admits a self-incriminating fact may be required\nto disclose all information relevant to that fact except when there is a real\ndanger of further self-incrimination. This limited waiver of the privilege\napplies only at the trial in which the answer is given, does not extend to a\nrehearing or new or other trial, and is subject to Mil. R. Evid. 608(b). (5)\n\nWaiver by the accused. When an accused testifies voluntarily as a witness, the accused thereby waives\nthe privilege against self-incrimination with respect to the matters concerning\nwhich he or she so testifies. If the accused is on trial for two or more\noffenses and on direct examination testifies concerning the issue of guilt or\ninnocence as to only one or some of the offenses, the accused may not be\ncross-examined as to guilt or innocence with respect to the other offenses\nunless the cross-examination is relevant to an offense concerning which the\naccused has testified. This waiver is subject to Mil. R. Evid. 608(b). (6)\n\nEffect of claiming the\nprivilege. (i) Generally. The fact that a\nwitness has asserted the privilege against self-incrimination in refusing to\nanswer a question cannot be considered as raising any inference unfavorable to\neither the accused or the government. (ii)\n\nOn cross-examination. If a witness\nasserts the privilege against self-incrimination on cross-examination, the\nmilitary judge, upon motion, may strike the direct testimony of the witness in\nwhole or in part, unless the matters to which the witness refuses to testify\nare purely collateral. (iii)\n\nPretrial. The fact that the accused during official questioning and in exercise\nof rights under the\n\nFifth\n\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States or\n\nMilitary Law, section 130.31, remained silent, refused to answer a certain\nquestion, requested counsel, or requested that the questioning be terminated is\ninadmissible against the accused. (7)\n\nInstructions. When the accused does not\ntestify at trial, defense counsel may request that the members of the court be\ninstructed to disregard that fact and not to draw any adverse inference from\nit. Defense counsel may request that the members not be so instructed. Defense\ncounsel's election shall be binding upon the military judge except that the\nmilitary judge may give the instruction when the instruction is necessary in\nthe interests of justice. (b) Privilege concerning mental examination\nof an accused. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. The accused\nhas a privilege to prevent any statement made by the accused at a mental\nexamination ordered under N.Y.R.C.M. 706 and any derivative evidence obtained\nthrough use of such a statement from being received into evidence against the\naccused on the issue of guilt or innocence or during sentencing proceedings. This privilege may be claimed by the accused notwithstanding the fact that the\naccused may have been warned of the rights provided by Mil. R. Evid. 305 at the\nexamination. (2)\n\nExceptions. (i) There is no privilege under this\nsubdivision when the accused first introduces into evidence such statements or\nderivative evidence. (ii)\n\nAn expert\nwitness for the prosecution may testify as to reasons for the expert's\nconclusions and the reasons therefor as to the mental state of the accused if\nexpert testimony offered by the defense as to the mental condition of the\naccused has been received in evidence, but such testimony may not extend to\nstatements of the accused except as provided in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (3)\n\nRelease\nof evidence. If the defense offers expert testimony concerning the mental\ncondition of the accused, the military judge, upon motion, shall order the\nrelease to the prosecution of the full contents, other than any statements made\nby the accused, of any report prepared pursuant to N.Y.R.C.M. 706. If the\ndefense offers statements made by the accused at such examination, the military\njudge may upon motion order the disclosure of such statements made by the\naccused and contained in the report as may be necessary in the interests of\njustice. (4)\n\nNoncompliance by the\naccused. The military judge may prohibit an accused who refuses to cooperate in\na mental examination authorized under N.Y.R.C.M. 706 from presenting any expert\nmedical testimony as to any issue that would have been the subject of the\nmental examination. (5)\n\nProcedure. The privilege in this subdivision may be claimed by the accused only under the\nprocedure set forth in Mil. R. Evid. 304 for an objection or a motion to\nsuppress. (c) Degrading\nquestions. No person may be compelled to make a statement or produce evidence\nbefore any military tribunal if the statement or evidence is not material to\nthe issue and may tend to degrade that person. (d) Confessions and admissions. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. Except as provided in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, an involuntary statement or any derivative\nevidence therefrom may not be received in evidence against an accused who made\nthe statement if the accused makes a timely motion to suppress or an objection\nto the evidence under this subdivision. (2)\n\nExceptions. (i) Where the statement is involuntary only\nin terms of noncompliance with the requirements concerning counsel under Mil. R. Evid. 305(d), 305(e), and 305(g), this subdivision does not prohibit use of\nthe statement to impeach by contradiction the in-court testimony of the accused\nor the use of such statement in a later prosecution against the accused for\nperjury, false swearing, or the making of a false official statement. (ii)\n\nEvidence that was obtained as a result\nof an involuntary statement may be used when the evidence would have been\nobtained even if the involuntary statement had not been made. (iii)\n\nDerivative evidence. Evidence that is\nchallenged under this subdivision as derivative evidence may be admitted\nagainst the accused if the military judge finds by a preponderance of the\nevidence that the statement was made voluntarily, that the evidence was not\nobtained by use of the statement, or that the evidence would have been obtained\neven if the statement had not been made. (3)\n\nDefinitions. As used in these rules: (i) A confession is an acknowledgment of\nguilt. (ii)\n\nAn admission is a\nself-incriminating statement falling short of an acknowledgment of guilt, even\nif it was intended by its maker to be exculpatory. (iii)\nA statement is involuntary if it is\nobtained in violation of the self-incrimination privilege or due process clause\nof the\n\nFifth\n\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States, article 31, or\nthrough the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful\ninducement. (4)\n\nProcedure. (i) Disclosure. Prior to\narraignment, the prosecution shall disclose to the defense the contents of all\nstatements, oral or written made by the accused that are relevant to the case, known to the trial counsel, and within the control of the Armed\n\nForces. (ii)\n\nMotions and\nobjections. (a) Motions to suppress or\nobjections under this subdivision or Mil. R. Evid. 302 or 305 to statements\nthat have been disclosed shall be made by the defense prior to submission of a\nplea. In the absence of such motion or objection, the defense may not raise the\nissue at a later time except as permitted by the military judge for good cause\nshown. Failure to so move or object constitutes a waiver of the\nobjection. (b) If the prosecution\nintends to offer against the accused a statement made by the accused that was\nnot disclosed prior to arraignment, the prosecution shall provide timely notice\nto the military judge and to counsel for the accused. The defense may enter an\nobjection at that time and the military judge may make such orders as are\nrequired in the interests of justice. (c) If evidence is disclosed as derivative\nevidence under this subdivision prior to arraignment, any motion to suppress or\nobjection under this subdivision or Mil. R. Evid. 302 or 305 shall be made in\naccordance with the procedure for challenging a statement under clause (a) of\nthis subparagraph. If such evidence has not been so disclosed prior to\narraignment, the requirements of clause (b) apply. (iii)\n\nSpecificity. The military judge may\nrequire the defense to specify the grounds upon which the defense moves to\nsuppress or object to evidence. If defense counsel, despite the exercise of due\ndiligence, has been unable to interview adequately those persons involved in\nthe taking of a statement, the military judge may make any order required in\nthe interests of justice, including authorization for the defense to make a\ngeneral motion to suppress or general objection. (iv)\n\nRulings. A motion to suppress or an\nobjection to evidence made prior to plea shall be ruled upon prior to plea\nunless the military judge, for good cause, orders that it be deferred for\ndetermination at trial, but no such determination shall be deferred if a\nparty's right to appeal the ruling is affected adversely. Where factual issues\nare involved in ruling upon such motion or objection, the military judge shall\nstate essential findings of fact on the record. (v) Effect of guilty plea. Except as\notherwise expressly provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 910(a)(2), a plea of guilty to an\noffense that results in a finding of guilty waives all privileges against\nself-incrimination and all motion's and objections under this subdivision with\nrespect to that offense regardless of whether raised prior to plea. (5)\n\nBurden of proof. When an\nappropriate motion or objection has been made by the defense under this\nsubdivision, the prosecution has the burden of establishing the admissibility\nof the evidence. When a specific motion or objection has been required under\nsubparagraph (4)(iii) of this subdivision, the burden on the prosecution\nextends only to the grounds upon which the defense moved to suppress or object\nto the evidence. (i) In general. The military\njudge must find by a preponderance of the evidence that a statement by the\naccused was made voluntarily before it may be received into evidence. When\ntrial is by a special court-martial without a military judge, a determination\nby the president of the court that a statement was made voluntarily is subject\nto objection by any member of the court. When such objection is made, it shall\nbe resolved pursuant to N.Y.R.C.M. 801(e)(3)(C). (ii)\n\nWeight of the evidence. If a statement\nis admitted into evidence, the military judge shall permit the defense to\npresent relevant evidence with respect to the voluntariness of the statement\nand shall instruct the members to give such weight to the statement as it\ndeserves under all the circumstances. When trial is by military judge without\nmembers, the military judge shall determine the appropriate weight to give the\nstatement. (iii)\n\nDerivative\nevidence. Evidence that is challenged under this subdivision as derivative\nevidence may be admitted against the accused if the military judge finds by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the statement was made voluntarily, that the\nevidence was not obtained by use of the statement, or that the evidence would\nhave been obtained even if the statement had not been made. (6)\n\nDefense evidence. The defense\nmay present evidence relevant to the admissibility of evidence as to which\nthere has been an objection or motion to suppress under this subdivision. An\naccused may testify for the limited purpose of denying that the accused made\nthe statement or that the statement was made voluntarily. Prior to the\nintroduction of such testimony by the accused, the defense shall inform the\nmilitary judge that the testimony is offered under this paragraph. When the\naccused testifies under this paragraph, the accused may be cross-examined only\nas to the matter on which he or she testifies. Nothing said by the accused on\neither direct or cross-examination may be used against the accused for any\npurpose other than in a prosecution for perjury, false swearing, or the making\nof a false official statement. (7)\n\nCorroboration. An admission or a confession of the accused may be considered as\nevidence against the accused on the question of guilt or innocence only if\nindependent evidence, either direct or circumstantial, has been introduced that\ncorroborates the essential facts admitted to justify sufficiently an inference\nof their truth other uncorroborated confessions or admissions of the accused\nthat would themselves require corroboration may not be used to supply this\nindependent evidence. If the independent evidence raises an inference of the\ntruth of some but not all of the essential facts admitted, then the confession\nor admission may be considered as evidence against the accused only with\nrespect to those essential facts stated in the confession or admission that are\ncorroborated by the independent evidence. Corroboration is not required for a\nstatement made by the accused before the court by which the accused is being\ntried, for statements made prior to or contemporaneously with the act, or for\nstatements offered under a rule of evidence other than that pertaining to the\nadmissibility of admissions or confessions. (i) Quantum of evidence needed. The\nindependent evidence necessary to establish corroboration need not be\nsufficient of itself to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the truth of facts\nstated in the admission or confession. The independent evidence need raise only\nan inference of the truth of the essential facts admitted. The amount and type\nof evidence introduced as corroboration is a factor to be considered by the\ntrier of fact in determining the weight, if any, to be given to the admission\nor confession. (ii)\n\nProcedure. The\nmilitary judge alone shall determine when adequate evidence of corroboration\nhas been received. Corroborating evidence usually is to be introduced before\nthe admission or confession is introduced but the military judge may admit\nevidence subject to later corroboration. (8)\n\nMiscellaneous. (i) Oral statements. A voluntary oral\nconfession or admission of the accused may be proved by the testimony of anyone\nwho heard the accused make it, even if it was reduced to writing and the\nwriting is not accounted for. (ii)\n\nCompleteness. If only part of an alleged admission or confession is introduced\nagainst the accused, the defense, by cross-examination or otherwise, may\nintroduce the remaining portions of the statement. (iii)\n\nCertain admissions by silence. A\nperson's failure to deny an accusation of wrongdoing concerning an offense for\nwhich at the time of the alleged failure the person was under official\ninvestigation or was in confinement, arrest, or custody does not support an\ninference of an admission of the truth of the accusation. (iv)\n\nRefusal to obey order to submit body\nsubstance. If an accused refuses a lawful order to submit for chemical analysis\na sample of his or her blood, breath, urine or other body substance, evidence\nof such refusal may be admitted into evidence on: (a) a charge of violating an order to submit\nsuch a sample; or\n(b) any other\ncharge on which the results of the chemical analysis would have been\nadmissible. (e) Warnings about rights. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. A statement obtained in\nviolation of this subdivision is involuntary and shall be treated under Mil. R. Evid. 304. (2)\n\nDefinitions. As used\nin this subdivision: (i) A person subject to\nthe code includes a person acting as a knowing agent of a military unit or of a\nperson subject to the code. (ii)\n\nInterrogation includes any formal or informal questioning in which an\nincriminating response either is sought or is a reasonable consequence of such\nquestioning. (3)\n\nWarnings concerning the accusation, right to remain silent, and use of\nstatements. A person subject to the State code who is required to give warnings\nunder Military Law section 130.31 may not interrogate or request any statement\nfrom an accused or a person suspected of an offense without first: (i) informing the accused or suspect of the\nnature of the accusation; (ii)\nadvising the accused or suspect that the accused or suspect has the right to\nremain silent; and\n(iii)\nadvising\nthe accused or suspect that any statement made may be used as evidence against\nthe accused or suspect in a trial by court-martial. (4)\n\nCounsel rights and warnings. (i) General rule. When evidence of a\ntestimonial or communicative nature within the meaning of the\n\nFifth\n\nAmendment\nto the Constitution of the United States either is sought or is a reasonable\nconsequence of an interrogation, an accused or a person suspected of an offense\nis entitled to consult with counsel as provided by subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph, to have such counsel present at the interrogation, and to be warned\nof these rights prior to the interrogation if: (a) the interrogation is conducted by a\nperson subject to the code who is required to give warnings under Military Law\nsection 130.31 and the accused or suspect is in custody, could reasonably\nbelieve himself or herself to be in custody, or is otherwise deprived of his or\nher freedom of action in any significant way; or\n(b) the interrogation is conducted by a\nperson subject to the code acting in a law enforcement capacity, or an agent of\nsuch a person, the interrogation is conducted subsequent to preferral of\ncharges or the imposition of pretrial restraint under R.C.M. 304, and the\ninterrogation concerns the offenses or matters that were the subject of the\npreferral of charges or were the cause of the imposition of pretrial\nrestraint. (ii)\n\nCounsel. When a person entitled to counsel under this subdivision requests counsel, a\njudge advocate who is a member of the Bar of this State shall be provided by\nthe State of New York at no expense to the person and without regard to the\nperson's indigency or lack thereof before the interrogation may proceed. In\naddition to counsel supplied by the State of New York, the person may retain\ncivilian counsel at no expense to the State of New York. An accused or suspect\ndoes not have a right under this subdivision to have military counsel of his or\nher own selection. (5)\n\nNotice to counsel. When a person subject to the code who is required to give\nwarnings under paragraph (3) of this subdivision intends to question an accused\nor person suspected of an offense and knows or reasonably should know that\ncounsel either has been appointed for or retained by the accused or suspect\nwith respect to that offense, the counsel must be notified of the intended\ninterrogation and given a reasonable time in which to attend before the\ninterrogation may proceed. (6)\n\nExercise of rights. If a person chooses to exercise the privilege against\nself-incrimination or the right to counsel under this subdivision, questioning\nmust cease immediately. (7)\n\nWaiver. (i) General rule. After receiving applicable\nwarnings under this subdivision, a person may waive the rights described\ntherein and in Mil. R. Evid. 301 and make a statement. The waiver must be made\nfreely, knowingly, and intelligently. A written waiver is not required. The\naccused or suspect must acknowledge affirmatively that he or she understands\nthe rights involved, affirmatively decline the right to counsel and\naffirmatively consent to making a statement. (ii)\n\nCounsel. If the right to counsel in\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision is applicable and the accused or suspect does\nnot decline affirmatively the right to counsel, the prosecution must\ndemonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the individual waived the\nright to counsel. In addition, if the notice to counsel in paragraph (5) of\nthis subdivision is applicable, a waiver of the right to counsel is not\neffective unless the prosecution demonstrates by a preponderance of the\nevidence that reasonable efforts to notify the counsel were unavailing or that\nthe counsel did not attend an interrogation scheduled within a reasonable\nperiod of time after the required notice was given. (8)\n\nNonmilitary interrogations. (i) General rule. When a person subject to\nthe code is interrogated by an official or agent of the United States, of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia, or of a State, Commonwealth, or possession of the United\n\nStates, or any political subdivision of such a state, commonwealth, or\npossession, and such official or agent is not required to give warnings under\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, the person's entitlement to rights warnings\nand the validity of any waiver of applicable rights shall be determined by the\nprinciples of law generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the\n\nUnited States district courts involving similar interrogations. (ii)\n\nForeign interrogations. Neither warnings\nunder paragraph (3) or (4), nor notice to counsel under paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision are required during an interrogation conducted abroad by officials\nof a foreign government or their agents unless such interrogation is conducted, instigated, or participated in by military personnel or their agents or by\nthose officials or agents listed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. A\nstatement obtained during such an interrogation is involuntary within the\nmeaning of Mil. R. Evid. 304(b)(3) if it is obtained through the use of\ncoercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement. An interrogation is not\n\"participated in\" by military personnel or their agents or by the officials or\nagents listed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph merely because such a\nperson was present at an interrogation conducted in a foreign nation by\nofficials of a foreign government or their agents, or because such a person\nacted as an interpreter or took steps to mitigate damage to property or\nphysical harm during the foreign interrogation. (f) Statements by one of several accused. When two or more accused are tried at the same trial, evidence of a statement\nmade by one of them which is admissible only against him or her or only against\nsome but not all of the accused may not be received in evidence unless all\nreferences inculpating an accused against whom the statement is inadmissible\nare deleted effectively or the maker of the statement is subject to\ncross-examination. (g) Evidence\nobtained from unlawful searches and seizures. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. Evidence obtained as a\nresult of an unlawful search or seizure made by a person acting in a\ngovernmental capacity is inadmissible against the accused if: (i) Objection. The accused makes a timely\nmotion to suppress or an objection to the evidence under this subdivision; and\n(ii)\n\nAdequate interest. The\naccused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the person, place or\nproperty searched; the accused had a legitimate interest in the property or\nevidence seized when challenging a seizure; or the accused would otherwise have\ngrounds to object to the search or seizure under the Constitution of the United\n\nStates as applied to members of the Armed Forces. (2)\n\nExceptions. (i) Evidence that was obtained as a result of\nan unlawful search or seizure may be used to impeach by contradiction the\nin-court testimony of the accused. (ii)\n\nEvidence that was obtained as a result\nof an unlawful search or seizure may be used when the evidence would have been\nobtained even if such unlawful search or seizure had not been made. (iii)\n\nEvidence that was obtained as a result\nof an unlawful search or seizure may be used if: (a) the search or seizure resulted from an\nauthorization to search, seize or apprehend issued by an individual competent\nto issue the authorization under Mil. R. Evid. 315(d) or from a search warrant\nor arrest warrant issued by competent civilian authority; (b) the individual issuing the authorization\nor warrant had a substantial basis for determining the existence of probable\ncause; and\n(c) the officials\nseeking and executing the authorization or warrant reasonably and with good\nfaith relied on the issuance of the authorization or warrant. Good faith shall\nbe determined on an objective standard. (3)\n\nNature of search or seizure. A search or\nseizure is \"unlawful\" if it was conducted, instigated, or participated in by: (i) Military personnel. Military personnel or\ntheir agents and was in Violation of the Constitution of the United States as\napplied to members of the Armed Forces, an Act of Congress applicable to trials\nby court-martial that requires exclusion of evidence obtained in violation\nthereof, or Mil. R. Evid. 312- 317. (ii)\n\nOther officials. Other officials or\nagents of the United States of the District of Columbia, or of a State, Commonwealth, or possession of the United States or any political subdivision\nof such a State, Commonwealth, or possession and was in violation of the\n\nConstitution of the United States, or is unlawful under the principles of law\ngenerally applied in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district\ncourts involving a similar search or seizure.

(4)\n\nMotions to suppress and objections. (i) Disclosure. Prior to arraignment, the\nprosecution shall disclose to the defense all evidence seized from the person\nor property of the accused, or believed to be owned by the accused, that it\nintends to offer into evidence against the accused at trial.

(a) When evidence has been disclosed under\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, any motion to suppress or objection under\nthis subdivision shall be made by the defense prior to submission of a plea. In\nthe absence of such motion or objection, the defense may not raise the issue at\na later time except as permitted by the military judge for good cause shown. Failure to so move or object constitutes a waiver of the motion or\nobjection. (b) If the prosecution\nintends to offer evidence seized from the person or property of the accused\nthat was not disclosed prior to arraignment, the prosecution shall provide\ntimely notice to the military judge and to counsel for the accused. The defense\nmay enter an objection at that time and the military judge may make such orders\nas are required in the interest of justice. (c) If evidence is disclosed as derivative\nevidence under this paragraph prior to arraignment, any motion to suppress or\nobjection under this subdivision shall be made in accordance with the procedure\nfor challenging evidence under clause (a) of this subparagraph. If such\nevidence has not been so disclosed prior to arraignment, the requirements of\nclause (b) of this paragraph apply. (iii)\n\nSpecificity. The military judge may\nrequire the defense to specify the grounds upon which the defense moves to\nsuppress or object to evidence. If defense counsel, despite the exercise of due\ndiligence, has been unable to interview adequately those persons involved in\nthe search or seizure, the military judge may enter any order required by the\ninterests of justice, including authorization for the defense to make a general\nmotion to suppress or a general objection. (iv)\n\nRulings. A motion to suppress or an\nobjection to evidence made prior to plea shall be ruled upon prior to plea\nunless the military judge, for good cause, orders that it be deferred for\ndetermination at the trial of the general issue or until after findings, but no\nsuch determination shall be deferred if a party's right to appeal the ruling is\naffected adversely. Where factual issues are involved in ruling upon such\nmotion or objection, the military judge shall state essential findings of fact\non the record. (5)\n\nBurden of proof. (i) In general. When an\nappropriate motion or objection has been made by the defense under paragraph\n(4) of this subdivision, the prosecution has the burden of proving by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the evidence was not obtained as a result of\nan unlawful search or seizure, that the evidence would have been obtained even\nif the unlawful search or seizure had not been made, or that the evidence was\nobtained by officials who reasonably and with good faith relied on the issuance\nof an authorization to search, seize, or apprehend or a search warrant or an\narrest warrant. (ii)\n\nDerivative\nevidence. Evidence that is challenged under this subdivision as derivative\nevidence may be admitted against the accused if the military judge finds by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the evidence was not obtained as a result of\nan unlawful search or seizure, that the evidence would have been obtained even\nif the unlawful search or seizure had not been made, or that the evidence was\nobtained by officials who reasonably and with good faith relied on the issuance\nof an authorization to search, seize or apprehend or a search warrant or an\narrest warrant.

(6)\n\nDefense evidence. The defense may present evidence relevant to the\nadmissibility of evidence as to which there has been an appropriate motion or\nobjection under this subdivision. An accused may testify for the limited\npurpose of contesting the legality of the search or seizure giving rise to the\nchallenged evidence.

When the accused testifies under this paragraph, the accused may be cross-examined only as to the matter on which he or she\ntestifies. Nothing said by the accused on either direct or cross-examination\nmay be used against the accused for any purpose other than in a prosecution for\nperjury, false swearing, or the making of a false official statement. (7)\n\nScope of motions and objections\nchallenging probable cause. (i) Generally. If\nthe defense challenges evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant or search\nauthorization on the grounds that the warrant or authorization was not based\nupon probable cause, the evidence relevant to the motion is limited to evidence\nconcerning the information actually presented to or otherwise known by the\nauthorizing officer, except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nFalse statements. If the defense makes a substantial preliminary showing that a government agent\nincluded a false statement knowingly and intentionally or with reckless\ndisregard for the truth in the information presented to the authorizing\nofficer, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of\nprobable cause, the defense, upon request, shall be entitled to a hearing. At\nthe hearing, the defense has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of\nthe evidence the allegation of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. If the defense meets its burden, the prosecution has the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, with the false\ninformation set aside, that the remaining information presented to the\nauthorizing officer is sufficient to establish probable cause. If the\nprosecution does not meet its burden, the objection or motion shall be granted\nunless the search is otherwise lawful under these rules. (8)\n\nObjections to evidence seized\nunlawfully. If a defense motion or objection under this subdivision is\nsustained in whole or in part, the members may not be informed of that fact\nexcept insofar as the military judge must instruct the members to disregard\nevidence. (9)\n\nEffect of guilty\nplea. Except as otherwise expressly provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 910(a)(2), a plea of\nguilty to an offense that results in a finding of guilty waives all issues\nunder the\n\nFourth\n\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States and Mil. R. Evid. 311-317 with respect to that offense whether or not raised prior to\nplea. (h) Body views and\nintrusions. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. Evidence\nobtained from body views and intrusions conducted in accordance with this\nsubdivision is admissible at trial when relevant and not otherwise inadmissible\nunder these rules. (2)\n\nVisual\nexamination of the body. (i) Consensual. Visual examination of the unclothed body may be made with the consent of the\nindividual subject to the inspection in accordance with Mil. R. Evid. 314(e). (ii)\n\nInvoluntary. An\ninvoluntary display of the unclothed body, including a visual examination of\nbody cavities, may be required only if conducted in reasonable fashion and\nauthorized under the following provisions of the Military Rules of Evidence: inspections and inventories under Mil. R. Evid. 313; searches under Mil. R. Evid. 314(b) and 314(c) if there is a reasonable suspicion that weapons, contraband, or evidence of crime is concealed on the body of the person to be\nsearched; searches within jails and similar facilities under Mil. R. Evid. 314(j) if reasonably necessary to maintain the security of the institution or\nits personnel; searches incident to lawful apprehension under Mil. R. Evid. 314(g); emergency searches under Mil. R. Evid. 314(i); and probable cause\nsearches under Mil. R. Evid. 315. An examination of the unclothed body under\nthis subdivision should be conducted whenever practicable by a person of the\nsame sex as that of the person being examined; provided, however, that failure\nto comply with this requirement does not make an examination an unlawful search\nwithin the meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 311. (3)\n\nIntrusion into body cavities. A\nreasonable nonconsensual physical intrusion into the mouth, nose, and ears may\nbe made when a visual examination of the body under paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision is permissible. Nonconsensual intrusions into other body cavities\nmay be made: (i) For purposes of seizure. When there is a clear indication that weapons, contraband, or other evidence of\ncrime is present, to remove weapons, contraband, or evidence of crime\ndiscovered under paragraph (2) and subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph or under\n\nMil. R. Evid. 316(d)(4)(c) if such intrusion is made in a reasonable fashion by\na person with appropriate medical qualifications: (ii)\n\nFor purposes of search. To search for\nweapons, contraband, or evidence of crime if authorized by a search warrant or\nsearch authorization under Mil. R. Evid. 315 and conducted by a person with\nappropriate medical qualifications. Notwithstanding this subdivision, a search under Mil. R. Evid. 314(h) may be made without a search warrant or authorization if such\nsearch is based on a reasonable suspicion that the individual is concealing\nweapons, contraband, or evidence of crime. (4)\n\nExtraction of body fluids. Nonconsensual\nextraction of body fluids, including blood and urine, may be made from the body\nof an individual pursuant to a search warrant or a search authorization under\n\nMil. R. Evid. 315. Nonconsensual extraction of body fluids may be made without\nsuch warrant or authorization, notwithstanding Mil. R. Evid. 315(g), only when\nthere is clear indication that evidence of crime will be found and that there\nis reason to believe that the delay that would result if a warrant or\nauthorization were sought could result in the destruction of the evidence. Involuntary extraction of body fluids under this subdivision must be done in a\nreasonable fashion by a person with appropriate medical\nqualifications. (5)\n\nOther intrusive\nsearches. Nonconsensual intrusive searches of the body made to locate or obtain\nweapons, contraband, or evidence of crime and not within the scope of paragraph\n(2) or (3) of this subdivision may be made only upon search warrant or search\nauthorization under Mil. R. Evid. 315 and only if such search is conducted in a\nreasonable fashion by a person with appropriate medical qualifications and does\nnot endanger the health of the person to be searched. Compelling a person to\ningest substances for the purposes of locating the properly described above or\nto compel the bodily elimination of such property is a search within the\nmeaning of this section. Notwithstanding this subdivision, a person who is\nneither a suspect nor an accused may not be compelled to submit to an intrusive\nsearch of the body for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence of\ncrime. (6)\n\nIntrusions for valid\nmedical purposes. Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to interfere with\nthe lawful authority of the Armed Forces to take whatever action may be\nnecessary to preserve the health of a service member. Evidence or contraband\nobtained from an examination or intrusion conducted for a valid medical purpose\nmay be seized and is not evidence obtained from an unlawful search or seizure\nwithin the meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 311. (i) Inspections and inventories in the Armed\n\nForces. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. Evidence obtained\nfrom inspections and inventories in the Armed Forces conducted in accordance\nwith this subdivision is admissible at trial when relevant and not otherwise\ninadmissible under these rules. (2)\n\nInspections. An \"inspection\" is an examination of the whole or in part of a\nunit, organization, installation, vessel, aircraft, or vehicle, including an\nexamination conducted at entrance and exit points, conducted as an incident of\ncommand the primary purpose of which is to determine and to ensure the\nsecurity, military fitness, or good order and discipline of the unit, organization, installation, vessel, aircraft, or vehicle. An inspection may\ninclude but is not limited to an examination to determine and to ensure that\nany or all of the following requirements are met: that the command is properly\nequipped, functioning properly, maintaining proper standards or readiness, sea\nor airworthiness, sanitation and cleanliness, and that personnel are present, fit, and ready for duty. An inspection also includes an examination to locate\nand confiscate unlawful weapons and other contraband. An order to produce body\nfluids, such as urine, is permissible in accordance with this subdivision. An\nexamination made for the primary purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a\ntrial by court-martial or in other disciplinary proceedings is not an\ninspection within the meaning of this subdivision. If a purpose of an\nexamination is to locate weapons or contraband, and if: (i) the examination was directed immediately\nfollowing a report of a specific offense in the unit, organization, installation, vessel, aircraft, or vehicle and was not previously\nscheduled; (ii)\nspecific\nindividuals are selected for examination; or\n(iii)\npersons examined are subjected to\nsubstantially different intrusions during the same examination, the prosecution\nmust prove by clear and convincing evidence that the examination was an\ninspection within the meaning of this subdivision. (2)\n\nInspections shall be conducted in a\nreasonable fashion and shall comply with Mil R. Evid. 312, if applicable. Inspections may utilize any reasonable natural or technological aid and may be\nconducted with or without notice to those inspected. Unlawful weapons, contraband, or other evidence of crime located during an inspection may be\nseized. (3)\n\nInventories. Unlawful\nweapons, contraband, or other evidence of crime discovered in the process of an\ninventory, the primary purpose of which is administrative in nature, may be\nseized. Inventories shall be conducted in a reasonable fashion and shall comply\nwith Mil. R. Evid. 312, if applicable. An examination made for the primary\npurpose of obtaining evidence for use in a trial by court-martial or in other\ndisciplinary proceedings is not an inventory within the meaning of this\nsubdivision. (j) Searches not requiring probable cause. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. Evidence obtained from reasonable searches not requiring probable\ncause conducted pursuant to this subdivision is admissible at trial when\nrelevant and not otherwise inadmissible under these rules. (2)\n\nSearches upon entry to or exit from\n\nUnited States installations, aircraft, and vessels abroad. In addition to the\nauthority to conduct inspections under Mil. R. Evid. 313(b), a commander of a\n\nUnited States military installation, enclave, or aircraft on foreign soil, or\nin foreign or international airspace, or a United States vessel in foreign or\ninternational waters, may authorize appropriate personnel to search persons or\nthe property of such persons upon entry to or exit from the installation, enclave, aircraft, or vessel to ensure the security, military fitness, or good\norder and discipline of the command. Such searches may not be conducted at a\ntime or in a manner contrary to an express provision of a treaty or agreement\nto which the United States is a party. Failure to comply with a treaty or\nagreement, however, does not render a search unlawful within the meaning of\n\nMil. R. Evid. 311. A search made for the primary purpose of obtaining evidence\nfor use in a trial by court-martial or other disciplinary proceeding is not\nauthorized by this paragraph. (3)\n\nSearches of Federal or State government property. Federal or State government\nproperty may be searched under this subdivision unless the person to whom the\nproperty is issued or assigned has a reasonable expectation of privacy therein\nat the time of the search. Under normal circumstances, a person does not have a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in government property that is not issued for\npersonal use. Wall or floor lockers in living quarters issued for the purpose\nof storing personal possessions normally are issued for personal use; but the\ndetermination as to whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in\ngovernment property issued for personal use depends on the facts and\ncircumstances at the time of the search. (4)\n\nConsent searches. (i) General rule. Searches may be conducted\nof any person or property with lawful consent. (ii)\n\nWho may consent. A person may consent to\na search of his or her person or property, or both, unless control over such\nproperty has been given to another. A person may grant consent to search\nproperty when the person exercises control over that property. (iii)\n\nScope of consent. Consent may be\nlimited in any way by the person granting consent, including limitations in\nterms of time, place, or property and may be withdrawn at any time. (iv)\n\nVoluntariness. To be valid, consent must\nbe given voluntarily. Voluntariness is a question to be determined from all the\ncircumstances. Although a person's knowledge of the right to refuse to give\nconsent is a factor to be considered in determining voluntariness, the\nprosecution is not required to demonstrate such knowledge as a prerequisite to\nestablishing a voluntary consent. Mere submission to the color of authority of\npersonnel performing law enforcement duties or acquiescence in an announced or\nindicated purpose to search is not a voluntary consent. (v) Burden of proof. Consent must be shown by\nclear and convincing evidence. The fact that a person was in custody while\ngranting consent is a factor to be considered in determining the voluntariness\nof the consent, but it does not affect the burden of proof. (5)\n\nSearches incident to a lawful\nstop. (i) Stops. A person authorized to\napprehend under R.C.M. 302(b) and others performing law enforcement duties may\nstop another person temporarily when the person making the stop has information\nor observes unusual conduct that leads him or her reasonably to conclude in\nlight of his or her experience that criminal activity may be afoot. The purpose\nof the stop must be investigatory in nature. (ii)\n\nFrisks. When a lawful stop is performed, the person stopped may be frisked for weapons when that person is reasonably\nbelieved to be armed and presently dangerous. Contraband or evidence located in\nthe process of a lawful frisk may be seized. (iii)\n\nMotor vehicles. When a person lawfully\nstopped is the driver or a passenger in a motor vehicle, the passenger\ncompartment of the vehicle may be searched for weapons if the official who made\nthe stop has a reasonable belief that the person stopped is dangerous and that\nthe person stopped may gain immediate control of a weapon. (6)\n\nSearches incident to a lawful\napprehension. (i) General rule. A person who\nhas been lawfully apprehended may be searched. (ii)\n\nSearch for weapons and destructible\nevidence. A search may be conducted for weapons or destructible evidence in the\narea within the immediate control of a person who has been apprehended. The\narea within the person's \"immediate control\" is the area which the individual\nsearching could reasonably believe that the person apprehended could reach with\na sudden movement to obtain such property; provided, that the passenger\ncompartment of an automobile, and containers within the passenger compartment\nmay be searched as a contemporaneous incident of the apprehension of an\noccupant of the automobile, regardless whether the person apprehended has been\nremoved from the vehicle. (iii)\n\nExamination for other persons. When an apprehension takes place at a location\nin which other persons reasonably might be present who might interfere with the\napprehension or endanger those apprehending, a reasonable examination may be\nmade of the general area in which such other persons might be\nlocated. (7)\n\nSearches\nwithin jails, confinement facilities, or similar facilities. Searches within\njails, confinement facilities, or similar facilities may be authorized by\npersons with authority over the institution. (8)\n\nEmergency searches to save life or for\nrelated purposes. In emergency circumstances to save life or for a related\npurpose, a search may be conducted of persons or property in a good faith\neffort to render immediate medical aid, to obtain information that will assist\nin the rendering of such aid, or to prevent immediate or ongoing personal\ninjury. (9)\n\nSearches of open fields\nor woodlands. A search of open fields or woodlands is not an unlawful search\nwithin the meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 311. (10)\n\nOther searches. A search of a type not\notherwise included in this subdivision and not requiring probable cause under\n\nMil. R. Evid. 315 may be conducted when permissible under the Constitution of\nthe United States and State of New York as applied to members of the Armed\n\nForces and State Organized Militia. (k) Probable cause searches. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. Evidence obtained from\nsearches requiring probable cause conducted in accordance with this subdivision\nis admissible at trial when relevant and not otherwise inadmissible under these\nrules. (2)\n\nDefinitions. As used in\nthese rules: (i) An authorization to search\nis an express permission, written or oral, issued by competent military\nauthority to search a person or an area for specified property or evidence or\nfor a specific person and to seize such property, evidence, or person. It may\ncontain an order directing subordinate personnel to conduct a search in a\nspecified manner. (ii)\nA search\nwarrant is an express permission to search and seize issued by competent\ncivilian authority. (3)\n\nScope of authorization. A search authorization may be issued under this\nsubdivision for a search of: (i) Persons. The\nperson of anyone subject to Federal or State military law or the law of war\nwherever found. (ii)\n\nMilitary\nproperty. Military property of the United States or the State of New York of\nnonappropriated fund activities of an Armed Force of the United States wherever\nlocated. (iii)\n\nPersons and property\nwithin military control. Persons or property situated on or in a military\ninstallation, encampment, vessel, aircraft, vehicle, or any other location\nunder military control, wherever located. (iv)\n\nNonmilitary property within a foreign\ncountry. (a) Property owned, used, occupied\nby, or in the possession of an agency of the United States other than the\n\nDepartment of Defense when situated in a foreign country. A search of such\nproperty may not be conducted without the concurrence of an appropriate\nrepresentative of the agency concerned. Failure to obtain such concurrence, however, does not render a search unlawful within the meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 311. (b) Other property situated in\na foreign country. If the United States is a party to a treaty or agreement\nthat governs a search in a foreign country, the search shall be conducted in\naccordance with the treaty or agreement. If there is no treaty or agreement, concurrence should be obtained from an appropriate representative of the\nforeign country with respect to a search under this clause (b) of this\nsubparagraph. Failure to obtain such concurrence or noncompliance with a treaty\nor agreement, however, does not render a search unlawful within the meaning of\n\nMil. R. Evid. 311. (4)\n\nPower to authorize. Authorization to\nsearch pursuant to this subdivision may be granted by an impartial individual\nin the following categories: (i) Commander. A\ncommander or other person serving in a position designated by the Chief of\n\nStaff to the Governor as either a person analogous to an officer in charge or a\nposition of command, who has control over the place where the property or\nperson to be searched is situated or found, or, if that place is not under\nmilitary control, having control over persons subject to Federal or State\nmilitary law or the law of war. (ii)\n\nMilitary judge. An otherwise impartial authorizing official does not lose\nthat character merely because he or she is present at the scene of a search or\nis otherwise readily available to persons who may seek the issuance of a search\nauthorization; nor does such an official lose impartial character merely\nbecause the official previously and impartially authorized investigative\nactivities when such previous authorization is similar in intent or function to\na pretrial authorization made by the United States district courts. (5)\n\nPower to search. Any commissioned officer, warrant officer, petty officer, noncommissioned\nofficer, and, when in the execution of guard or police duties, any criminal\ninvestigator, member of the Air Force security police, military police, or\nshore patrol, or person designated by proper authority to perform guard or\npolice duties, or any agent of any such person, may conduct or authorize a\nsearch when a search authorization has been granted under this subdivision or a\nsearch would otherwise be proper under paragraph (7) of this\nsubdivision. (6)\n\nBasis for search\nauthorizations. (i) Probable cause\nrequirement. A search authorization issued under this subdivision must be based\nupon probable cause. (ii)\n\nProbable\ncause determination. Probable cause to search exists when there is a reasonable\nbelief that the person, property, or evidence sought is located in the place or\non the person to be searched. A search authorization may be based upon hearsay\nevidence in whole or in part. A determination of probable cause under this\nsubdivision shall be based upon any or all of the following: (a) written statements communicated to the\nauthorizing officer; (b) oral\nstatements communicated to the authorizing official in person, via telephone, or by other appropriate means of communication; or\n(c) such information as may be known by the\nauthorizing official that would not preclude the officer from acting in an\nimpartial fashion. The Chief of Staff to the Governor may prescribe additional\nrequirements. (7)\n\nExigencies. A search warrant or search\nauthorization is not required under this subdivision for a search based on\nprobable cause when: (i) Insufficient time. There is reasonable belief that the delay necessary to obtain a search warrant\nor search authorization would result in the removal, destruction, or\nconcealment of the property or evidence sought. (ii)\n\nLack of communications. There is a\nreasonable military operational necessity that is reasonably believed to\nprohibit or prevent communication with a person empowered to grant a search\nwarrant or authorization and there is a reasonable belief that the delay\nnecessary to obtain a search warrant or search authorization would result in\nthe removal, destruction, or concealment of the property or evidence\nsought. (iii)\n\nSearch of operable\nvehicle. An operable vehicle is to be searched, except in the circumstances\nwhere a search warrant or authorization is required by the Constitution of the\n\nUnited States or the State of New York, this Chapter, or these rules. (iv)\n\nNot required by the Constitution. A\nsearch warrant or authorization is not otherwise required by the Constitution\nof the United States or the State of New York as applied to members of the\n\nArmed Forces or State organized militia. For purpose of this rule, a vehicle is \"operable\" unless a\nreasonable person would have known at the time of search that the vehicle was\nnot functional for purposes of transportation. (8)\n\nExecution. (i) Notice. If the person whose property is\nto be searched is present during a search conducted pursuant to a search\nauthorization granted under this subdivision, the person conducting the search\nshould when possible notify him or her of the act of authorization and the\ngeneral substance of the authorization. Such notice may be made prior to or\ncontemporaneously with the search. Failure to provide such notice does not make\na search unlawful within the meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 311. (ii)\n\nInventory. An inventory of the property\nseized shall be made at the time of a seizure under this subdivision or as soon\nas practicable thereafter. At an appropriate time, a copy of the inventory\nshall be given to a person from whose possession or premises the property was\ntaken. Failure to make an inventory, furnish a copy thereof, or otherwise\ncomply with this subparagraph does not render a search or seizure unlawful\nwithin the meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 311. (iii)\n\nForeign searches. Exeucution of a\nsearch authorization outside the United States and within the jurisdiction of a\nforeign nation should be in conformity with existing agreements between the\n\nUnited States and the foreign nation. Noncompliance with such an agreement does\nnot make an otherwise lawful search unlawful. (iv)\n\nSearch warrants. Any civilian or\nmilitary criminal investigator authorized to request search warrants pursuant\nto applicable law or regulation is authorized to serve and execute search\nwarrants. The execution of a search warrant affects admissibility only insofar\nas exclusion of evidence is required by the Constitution of the United States, an applicable Act of Congress, or the Constitution of the State of New\n\nYork. (l) Seizures. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. Evidence obtained\nfrom seizures conducted in accordance with this subdivision is admissible at\ntrial if the evidence was not obtained as a result of an unlawful search and if\nthe evidence is relevant and not otherwise inadmissible under these\nrules. (2)\n\nSeizure of property. Probable cause to seize property or evidence exists when there is a reasonable\nbelief that the property or evidence is an unlawful weapon, contraband, evidence of crime, or might be used to resist apprehension or to\nescape. (3)\n\nApprehension. Apprehension is governed by N.Y.R.C.M. 302. (4)\n\nSeizure of property or evidence. (i) Abandoned property. Abandoned property\nmay be seized without probable cause and without a search warrant or search\nauthorization. Such seizure may be made by any person. (ii)\n\nConsent. Property or evidence may be\nseized with consent consistent with the requirements applicable to consensual\nsearches under Mil. R. Evid. 314. (iii)\n\nFederal or State government property. Government property may be seized without probable cause and without a search\nwarrant or search authorization by any person listed in paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision, unless the person to whom the property is issued or assigned has a\nreasonable expectation of privacy therein, as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 314(d), at the time of the seizure. (iv)\n\nOther property. Property or evidence not included in subparagraphs (i)- (iii)\nof this paragraph may be seized for use in evidence by any person listed in\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision if: (a) Authorization. The person is authorized to seize the property or evidence by a\nsearch warrant or a search authorization under Mil. R. Evid. 315. (b) Exigent circumstances. The person has\nprobable cause to seize the property or evidence and under Mil. R. Evid. 315(g)\na search warrant or search authorization is not required. (c) Plain view. The person while in the\ncourse of otherwise lawful activity observes in a reasonable fashion property\nor evidence that the person has probable cause to seize. (v) Temporary detention. Nothing in this\nsubdivision shall prohibit temporary detention of property on less than\nprobable cause when authorized under the Constitution of the United States and\nthe State of New York. (5)\n\nPower to seize. Any commissioned officer, warrant officer, petty officer, non-commissioned officer, and, when in the\nexecution of guard or police duties, any criminal investigator, member of the\n\nAir Force security police, military police, or shore patrol, or individual\ndesignated by proper authority to perform guard or police duties, or any agent\nor any such person, may seize property pursuant to this subdivision. (6)\n\nOther seizures. A seizure of a type not\notherwise included in this subdivision may be made when permissible under the\n\nConstitution of the United States and State of New York as applied to members\nof the Armed Forces or State organized militia. (m) Interception of wire and oral\ncommunications. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. Wire or oral\ncommunications constitute evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful search\nor seizure within the meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 311 when such evidence may be\nexcluded under the\n\nFourth\n\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States as\napplied to members of the Armed Forces or if such evidence must be excluded\nunder a statute applicable to members of the Armed Forces or the Constitution\nof the State of New York as applied to members of the State organized\nmilitia. (n) Eyewitness\nidentification. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. (i) Admissibility. Testimony concerning a\nrelevant out of court identification by any person is admissible, subject to an\nappropriate objection under this subdivision, if such testimony is otherwise\nadmissible under these rules. The witness making the identification and any\nperson who has observed the previous identification may testify concerning it. When in testimony a witness identifies the accused as being, or not being, a\nparticipant in an offense or makes any other relevant identification concerning\na person in the courtroom, evidence that on a previous occasion the witness\nmade a similar identification is admissible to corroborate the witness'\ntestimony as to identity even if the credibility or the witness has not been\nattacked directly, subject to appropriate objection under this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nExclusionary\nrule. An identification of the accused as being a participant in an offense, whether such identification is made at the trial or otherwise, is inadmissible\nagainst the accused if: (a) the accused makes\na timely motion to suppress or an objection to the evidence under this\nsubdivision and if the identification is the result of an unlawful lineup or\nother unlawful identification process conducted by the United States or other\ndomestic authorities; or\n(b) exclusion of the evidence is required by the due process clause of the\n\nFifth\n\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States as applied to members of the\n\nArmed Forces or the New York State Constitution. Evidence other than an\nidentification of the accused that is obtained as a result of the unlawful\nlineup or unlawful identification process is inadmissible against the accused\nif the accused makes a timely motion to suppress or an objection to the\nevidence under this subdivision and if exclusion of the evidence is required\nunder the Constitution of the United States as applied to members of the Armed\n\nForces. (2)\n\nDefinition of unlawful. (i) Lineups and other\nidentification processes. A lineup or other identification process is\n\"unlawful\" if the identification is unreliable. An identification is unreliable\nif the lineup or other identification process, under the circumstances, is so\nsuggestive as to create a substantial likelihood of\nmisidentification. (ii)\n\nLineups: right to counsel. A lineup is \"unlawful\" if it is conducted in violation of the\nfollowing rights to counsel: (a) Military\nlineups. An accused or suspect is entitled to counsel if, after preferral of\ncharges or imposition of pretrial restraint under R.C.M. 304 for the offense\nunder investigation, the accused is subjected by persons subject to the State\ncode or their agents to a lineup for the purpose of identification. When a\nperson entitled to counsel under this subdivision requests counsel, a judge\nadvocate who is a member of the Bar of this State shall be provided by the\n\nState of New York at no expense to the accused or suspect and without regard to\nindigency or lack thereof before the lineup may proceed. The accused or suspect\nmay waive the rights provided in this subdivision if the waiver is freely, knowingly, and intelligently made. (b) Nonmilitary lineups. When a person\nsubject to the code is subjected to a lineup for purposes of identification by\nan official or agent of the United States, of the District of Columbia, or of a\n\nState, Commonwealth, or possession of the United States, or any political\nsubdivision of such a State, Commonwealth, or possession, and the provisions of\nclause (a) of this subparagraph do not apply, the person's entitlement to\ncounsel and the validity of any waiver of applicable rights shall be determined\nby the principles of law generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in\nthe United States district courts involving similar lineups; provided that such\nprinciples are not contrary to the Constitution of the State of New\n\nYork. (3)\n\nMotions to supress and objections. (i) Disclosure. Prior to arraignment, the prosecution shall disclose to the defense\nall evidence of a prior identification of the accused as a lineup or other\nidentification process that it intends to offer into evidence against the\naccused at trial. (ii)\n\nMotion or\nobjection. (a) When such evidence has been\ndisclosed, any motion to suppress or objection under this subdivision shall be\nmade by the defense prior to submission of a plea. In the absence of such\nmotion or objection, the defense may not raise the issue at a later time except\nas permitted by the military judge for good cause shown. Failure to so move\nconstitutes a waiver of the motion or objection. (b) If the prosecution intends to offer such\nevidence and the evidence was not disclosed prior to arraignment, the\nprosecution shall provide timely notice to the military judge and counsel for\nthe accused. The defense may enter an objection at that time and the military\njudge may make such orders as are required in the interests of\njustice. (c) If evidence is\ndisclosed as derivative evidence under this paragraph prior to arraignment, any\nmotion to suppress or objection under this subdivision shall be made in\naccordance with the procedure for challenging evidence under clause (a) of this\nsubparagraph. If such evidence has not been so disclosed prior to arraignment, the requirements of clause (b) of this subparagraph apply. (iii)\n\nSpecificity. The military judge may\nrequire the defense to specify the grounds upon which the defense moves to\nsuppress or object to evidence. If defense counsel, despite the exercise of due\ndiligence, has been unable to interview adequately those persons involved in\nthe lineup or other identification process, the military judge may enter any\norder required by the interests of justice, including authorization for the\ndefense to make a general motion to suppress or a general objection. (4)\n\nBurden of proof. When a\nspecific motion or objection has been required under subparagraph (3)(iii) of\nthis subdivision, the burden on the prosecution extends only to the grounds\nupon which the defense moved to suppress or object to the evidence. When an\nappropriate objection under this subdivision has been made by the defense, the\nissue shall be determined by the military judge as follows: (i) Right to counsel. When an objection\nraises the right to presence of counsel under this subdivision, the prosecution\nmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence that counsel was present at the\nlineup or that the accused, having been advised of the right to the presence of\ncounsel, voluntarily and intelligently waived that right prior to the lineup. When the military judge determines that an identification is the result of a\nlineup conducted without the presence of counsel or an appropriate waiver, any\nlater identification by one present at such unlawful lineup is also a result\nthereof unless the military judge determines that the contrary has been shown\nby clear and convincing evidence. (ii)\n\nUnreliable identification. When an\nobjection raises the issue of an unreliable identification, the prosecution\nmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the identification was\nreliable under the circumstances; provided, however, that if the military judge\nfinds the evidence of identification inadmissible under this paragraph, a later\nidentification may be admitted if the prosecution proves by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the later identification is not the result of the\ninadmissible identification. (5)\n\nDefense evidence. The defense may present\nevidence relevant to the issue of the admissibility of evidence as to which\nthere has been an appropriate motion or objection under this subdivision. An\naccused may testify for the limited purpose of contesting the legality of the\nlineup or identification process giving rise to the challenged evidence. Prior\nto the introduction of such testimony by the accused, the defense shall inform\nthe military judge that the testimony is offered under this paragraph. When the\naccused testifies under this paragraph, the accused may be cross-examined only\nas to the matter on which he or she testifies. Nothing said by the accused on\neither direct or cross-examination may be used against the accused for any\npurpose other than in a prosecution for perjury, false swearing, or the making\nof a false official statement. (6)\n\nRulings. A motion to suppress or an objection to evidence made prior to plea\nunder this subdivision shall be ruled upon prior to plea unless the military\njudge, for good cause, orders that it be deferred for determination at the\ntrial of the general issue or until after findings, but no such determination\nshall be deferred if a party's right to appeal the ruling is affected\nadversely. Where factual issues are involved in ruling upon such motion or\nobjection, the military judge shall state his or her essential findings of fact\non the record. (7)\n\nEffect of guilty\npleas. Except as otherwise expressly provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 910(a)(2), a plea\nof guilty to an offense that results in a finding of guilty waives all issues\nunder this subdivision with respect to that offense whether or not raised prior\nto the plea.
