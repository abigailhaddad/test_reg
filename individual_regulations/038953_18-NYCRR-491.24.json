  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 491.24 - Reimbursement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The operational plan for each shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter or\nshelter for adult families must include on forms and in the manner prescribed\nby the office a financial statement for the facility's most recently completed\nfiscal year where available, or where a facility has not been in operation, a\nfinancial statement for the facility operator's most recently completed fiscal\nyear. In addition, the operational plan must contain a proposed one-year\nbudget, including estimated income and expenditures. Such budget must set forth\nthe costs reasonable and necessary to operate and maintain the facility\nconsistent with each of the requirements of the operational plan and this Part. The budget must be based upon the estimated net actual expenditures for the\noperation and maintenance of facilities and for the care of the residents with\nrespect to items approved under the operational plan. The budget must be\npresented in sufficient detail to enable the office to identify costs not\nsubject to Federal financial participation. Budgets of facilities not operated\nby social services districts must be agreed upon between the social services\ndistrict and the facility operator. All budgets must be formulated to ensure\nthat the costs of resident services that may be paid from other funding\nsources, including but not limited to the MA program, are not included as costs\nin the proposed shelter budgets. (b) Costs reasonably necessary under any\noperational plan shall be limited as follows: (1)\n(i) Related party transactions. Actual costs for rental of land, building and\nequipment and other personal property owned or controlled by organizations or\npersons affiliated with an organization operating a facility, or owned or\ncontrolled by members, directors, trustees, officers or other key personnel of\nsuch operator or their families either directly or through corporations, trusts\nor other similar arrangements in which they hold more than 10 percent interest\nin such land, building and equipment or an interest valued at $1,000 or more, whichever is less, are allowable only to the extent that such rentals do not\nexceed the amount the operator would have received had legal title to the\nrented items or facilities been vested in the operator. (ii)\n\nActual charges in the nature of rent\nbetween or among organizations under common control are allowable to the extent\nsuch charges do not exceed the normal costs of ownership, such as depreciation, taxes, insurance and maintenance; provided that no part of such costs shall\nduplicate any other allowed costs. (iii)\n\nNonrelated party transaction. Rental\ncosts of land, building and equipment and other personal property are allowable\nif the rates are reasonable in light of such factors as rental costs of\ncomparable facilities and market conditions in the areas, the type, life\nexpectancy, condition and value of the facilities leased, options available and\nother provisions of the rental agreement. Application of these factors, in\nsituations where rentals are extensively used, may involve, among other\nconsiderations, comparison of rental costs with the amount which the operating\norganization would have received had it owned the facilities. (iv)\n\nSales/leaseback transactions. Rental\ncosts specified in sale and leaseback agreements, incurred by persons or\norganizations through selling facilities to investment organizations, such as\ninsurance companies, associate institutions or private investors, and\nconcurrently leasing back the same facilities, are allowable only to the extent\nthat such rentals do not exceed the amount which the organization would have\nreceived had it retained legal title to the facilities. (2)\n\nCapital costs and depreciation are\nlimited as follows: (i) Capital costs are not\nallowable, except as provided in section\n600.3\n(b)(7)\nof\nthis Title. (ii)\n\nCompensation for\nthe use of buildings, capital improvements and capital equipment may be made\nthrough either depreciation or the allowance provided in section\n609.5\n(f)(2)\nof\nthis Title with respect to office space. Capital equipment\nis\nany equipment with an acquisition cost exceeding $1,500 and having a useful\nlife of more than two years. No depreciation allowance is permitted with\nrespect to the cost of land. Costs incurred for improvements which add to the\npermanent value of buildings and equipment or which appreciably prolong their\nintended life must be treated as capital expenditures. Costs incurred for\nnecessary maintenance, repair or upkeep of buildings or equipment which neither\nadd to nor appreciably prolong their useful life, but keep them in an efficient\noperating condition must not be treated as capital costs. (iii)\n\nDepreciation allowances must use the\nstraight-line method with a useful life reflecting the probable period of\nuseful service, which in the case of a building must not be less than 25 years; provided, however, that the office may authorize a shorter period for privately\nowned shelters, but in no case less than 10 years and then only when private\nfinancing cannot otherwise be obtained and a longer period would cause undue\nfinancial hardship. When a depreciation period less than 25 years is used, the\naggregate amount by which the reimbursement paid exceeds the amount which would\notherwise be payable over the same period constitutes an advance of\nreimbursement and the social services district must obtain and file a mortgage\nagreement securing any such advances. Such debt becomes due and owing upon the\nconversion of the facility to any use other than as a shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter or shelter for adult families, earlier than 25 years. With respect to publicly-owned shelters, the office may permit a depreciation\nperiod shorter than 25 years, but in no event less than the applicable period\nof probable usefulness under section\n11.00\nof\nthe Local Finance Law. Any determination to use a period shorter than 25 years\nmust be approved by the Director of the Division of the Budget. (iv)\n\nIf less than a 25-year useful life is\napproved, then in the case of privately owned shelters subject to a mortgage, or similar financial arrangement, the amount allowed in any year for\ndepreciation and interest will in no event exceed the amount paid by the\nfacility for interest and principal on the mortgaged premises. With respect to\npublicly-owned shelters, the amount allowed for the depreciation and interest\nwill in no event exceed the allocable amount paid by the social services\ndistrict for principal payments and costs for debt service with respect to the\npremises. (v) Interest costs may be\nconsidered an allowable cost subject to the following: (a) the capital indebtedness does not exceed\nthe current approved value of the property; (b) the interest rate charged for the\nborrowed funds is competitive with existing interest rates; (c) the interest is necessary and proper for\nthe operation, maintenance or acquisition of the facility; and\n(d) the interest must be supported by a\ncontractual agreement for the payment of interest and for the eventual\nrepayment of the loan for which the interest was incurred. (vi)\n\nIn the case of privately-owned shelters, depreciation shall be limited to the costs of acquisition, renovation and\nrehabilitation of the facility. The costs of acquisition shall be the lesser of\nthe actual costs incurred by the provider to acquire the facility or the fair\nmarket value of the facility. Shelter operators must provide an appraisal of\nthe property compiled by an independent appraiser with the financial material\nsubmitted with the operational plan to the office. (3)\n\nCosts of a shelter may include a\nreasonable allowance for reserve beds or standby capacity based upon the\nintended use of the facility, the capacity of the facility and foreseeable\nfluctuations in resident population. (c) Revised budgets must be submitted to and\napproved by the office prior to finalizing any purchase or rate agreement, and\nthereafter annually with respect to any facility subject to this\n\nPart. (d) The office must review\nthe material provided and the proposed budget. State reimbursement is available\nfor costs found by the office to be reasonable, subject to the approval of the\n\nDirector of the Division of the Budget. (e) The social services district may, within\n30 days, request a review of the office's determination of reimbursable costs\nby requesting consultation. The consultation period begins when a letter\nrequesting consultation is received by the office and continues until agreement\nis reached or the office affirms or redetermines the costs allowable; provided, however, that if within 30 days of a request for a review no decision is\nreached, the office's determination will be deemed affirmed unless the social\nservices district requests and the office grants an extension of time for a\ndecision. (f) A social services\ndistrict may claim and receive reimbursement from the office for costs approved\nunder subdivisions (d) and (e) of this section. Such reimbursement must be\nadjusted to reflect actual allowable costs in any fiscal period covered by an\noperational plan. Requests for adjustment for a fiscal period may be submitted\nduring, but in no event later than 90 days after the end of, such fiscal\nperiod. No requests for adjustments will be approved if the actual occupancy\nrate of a facility falls below the minimum occupancy set forth in the\noperational plan for the facility approved by the office. Reimbursement for the\ncosts of shelter for persons receiving Safety Net Assistance, Veteran\n\nAssistance, or Emergency Assistance for Adults programs, or additional State\npayments must be charged to the applicable program. In addition, social\nservices districts are subject to the recordkeeping requirements contained in\n\nPart 600 of this Title with respect to all shelter care for which reimbursement\nis claimed.
