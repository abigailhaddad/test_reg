  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.19 - Eligibility requirements for specialized transportation services for the transit disabled\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To be\neligible for STOA, any specialized transportation service must be available to\nall transit disabled persons in the service area on an equal opportunity basis\nand may not give preference to any particular client subgroup. This requirement\nis not intended to preclude market segmentation based on the amount of physical\nassistance required by the rider. Service must operate in accordance with the\npublished service area, hours of operation and fares. Acceptable arrangements\nshall be made to market the availability of the service. (1)\n\nService funding: (i) A public transportation system may accept\na per passenger payment from a human service agency in lieu of collecting a\nfare from a human service agency client. Also, the public transportation system\nmay charge the human service agency a fare higher than the fare charged to\nother riders in those circumstances where accommodating the travel demand of an\nagency requires the system to operate a level of service which exceeds\navailable Federal and State mass transportation operating assistance and the\nlocal match to that assistance. (ii)\n\nWhere a human service agency's\ntransportation needs are met by a public transportation system, such system\nshall continue, to the extent necessary, to use human service agency program\nfunds to cover that portion of the costs of specialized transportation services\nnot covered by fare-box, Federal and State mass transportation operating\nassistance and the local match to that assistance. (iii)\n\nIf Federal operating assistance is\navailable, it must be included as a source of revenue to cover the costs of the\nspecialized service in at least the same proportion as it covers the costs of\nthe services to the general public. In urbanized areas, the use of Federal\nassistance must be approved by the area's Metropolitan Planning Organization in\nthe Transportation Improvement Program. Voluntary local assistance (in excess\nof STOA match requirements) may be substituted for available Federal operating\nassistance. (2)\n(i) Where it is necessary to establish\nprocedures for prioritizing service delivery in order to allocate scarce\nresources, the prioritizing procedures must be fully documented and may not\ngive preference to any client group. (b) Where the principal operator of mass\ntransportation service for the general public as defined in section\n975.4\n(bb)\ndirectly provides specialized transportation services which are open to all\nmembers of the transit disabled public and where such services meet other\neligibility requirements as specified in the STOA regulations, these\nspecialized services are eligible for State transit operating assistance. Where more than one mass transportation system in the same\nservice area proposes to provide specialized transportation services, the New\n\nYork State Department of Transportation will determine which system is the\nsystem eligible to receive STOA for the provision of specialized services to\nthe transit disabled. (c) To be eligible for STOA, specialized transportation service provided in any\ncounty having no urbanized areas, or cities receiving STOA, must be operated, or purchased through contract, by the principal operator of general public\ntransportation in the county. (d) In counties where there is more than one public transportation system, and a\nspecialized service is proposed to be provided by an operator other than the\nprincipal operator, as defined in Section\n975.4\n(bb), such\nspecialized service may be eligible for STOA under the following additional\nconditions: (1)\n\nSpecialized transportation\nservice plan: (i) A specialized service plan\nmust be developed. Service is to be provided in accordance with a specialized\nservice plan, which details appropriate justification for the operation of\nservice by other than the principal operator and includes comments of the\nprincipal operator. The service plan should document service area; eligibility; hours of service; fares; service characteristics; restrictions; prioritization; and advance reservation requirements; organizational structure; and service\nagreements. The plan must also specify acceptable arrangements to market the\navailability of the service to persons who are disabled. (ii)\n\nSuch plan is subject to review by the\n\nDepartment to establish eligibility for STOA program funding. A program/report\nprepared to meet Federal requirements as meeting the plan requirements of this\n\nSubpart provided all requirements of this Subpart are included or appended may\nbe acceptable. (2)\n\nService Contract: (i) Private, for-profit and\nprivate, non-profit operators operating in the proposed service area must be\nafforded an equal opportunity to bid on the proposed contract(s), and\ncontract(s) should be reoffered for bid on a regular basis. (ii)\n\nEligibility must be limited to an\noperator (s) (1) whose primary organizational purpose, as stated in its\nincorporation papers, is as an operator (s) of passenger transportation, (2)\nwho has or is obtaining an operating permit as a common carrier from NYSDOT, and (3) who will subject its vehicles to NYSDOT inspections. (iii)\n\nThe public transportation system must\nsubstantially control all transportation service components of the specialized\ntransportation service system, including holding of contracts with the\noperators, marketing, and the compilation of Federal and State reports. The\ncontract for service must insure that the service complies with these\nregulations including the scheduling and dispatching of operations. (3)\n\nJustification for use of\nmultiple operations: Where mass transportation services for the transit disabled\nis best accomplished by contracts with more than one service operator, because\nof reasons of geographic coverage or market segmentation necessitated by\ndiffering amounts of physical assistance required by the passengers, then the\njustification, economic or otherwise, for employing more than one service\noperator must be documented in the plan. (e) Ineligible service(s): (1)\n\nTransportation services limited to the\ndisabled and/or elderly shall not be eligible for STOA in any service area\nwhere there is no public transportation system offering service for use by the\ngeneral public. (2)\n\nTransport of\nmeals or goods or emergency medical trips are not eligible services. (3)\n\nPortions of the specialized services\nwhich are client-specific and not available to the general transit disabled\npopulation are not eligible to be included in the calculation of State\noperating assistance. (4)\n\nOnly\nservices provided to disabled persons, as defined in section\n975.4\n(k) are\neligible for STOA. Where the specialized service system also serves\nnon-disabled persons, according to this definition, a method of allocation of\nservice passengers and vehicle miles must be documented and approved by the\n\nCommissioner, such that STOA payments can be made only on behalf of persons\nqualified to receive specialized services (i.e., persons who are disabled). Where a human service agency's transportation needs are met\nby a public transportation system, such system shall continue, to the extent\nnecessary, to use human service agency program funds to cover that portion of\nthe costs of public transportation services not covered by farebox, Federal and\n\nState mass transportation operating assistance and the local match to that\nassistance.
