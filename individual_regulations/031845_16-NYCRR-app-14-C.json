Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app 14-C\nState Regulations\nEND PREPARATION FOR BUTT WELDING SECTIONS HAVING UNEQUAL\nTHICKNESSES AND UNEQUAL SPECIFIED YIELD STRENGTHS\nExplanatory Notes\n\nGeneral\n1. The\nsketches in Figure 523-B illustrate acceptable preparations for joining pipe\nends by butt welding for materials having unequal wall thicknesses and/or with\nunequal strengths (minimum specified yield strength). 2. The thickness of the sections to be\njoined, beyond the joint design area, shall comply with the design requirements\nof this Part. 3. When the minimum\nspecified yield strengths of the sections to be joined are unequal, the\ndeposited weld metal shall have mechanical properties at least equal to those\nof the section having the higher strength. 4. The transition between ends of unequal\nthickness may be accomplished by taper or welding as illustrated or by means of\na prefabricated transition ring. 5. Sharp notches or grooves at the edge of the weld where it joins a slanted\nsurface shall be avoided. 6. For\njoining unequal thicknesses of equal specified yield strengths, the rules given\nherein apply, except there is no minimum angle limit to the taper. 7. THE MAXIMUM THICKNESS t\nd\nFOR DESIGN PURPOSES SHALL NOT BE GREATER THAN 1.5t. Internal Diameters Unequal\nA. For piping to operate at hoop stresses of\nless than 20 percent of specified minimum yield strength, if the nominal wall\nthicknesses of the adjoining ends do not vary more than 1/8 -inch, no special\ntreatment is necessary provided adequate penetration and bond is accomplished\nin welding. If the offset is greater than 1/8-inch the following paragraphs\nwill apply. FOR STRESS LEVELS ABOVE 20 PERCENT OF THE MINIMUM SPECIFIED\nYIELD STRENGTH. B. If the\nnominal wall thicknesses of the adjoining ends do not vary more than 3/32 inch, no special treatment is necessary provided full penetration and bond is\naccomplished in welding. See sketch (a). C. Where the nominal internal offset is more\nthan 3/32inch and there is no access to the inside of the pipe for welding, the\ntransition must be made by a taper cut on the inside end of the thicker\nsection. See sketch (b). The taper angle shall not be steeper than 30 deg. nor\nless than 14 deg. D. Where the\nnominal internal offset is more than 3/32 inch, but does not exceed 1/2 the\nthinner section, and there is access to the inside of the pipe for welding, the\ntransition may be made with a tapered weld as shown in sketch (c). The land on\nthe thicker section must be equal to the offset plus the land on abutting\nsection. E. Where the nominal\ninternal offset is more than 1/2 the thinner section, and there is access to\nthe inside of the pipe for welding, the transition may be made with a taper cut\non the inside end of the thicker section as shown in sketch (b), or by a\ncombination taper weld to 1/2 the thinner section and a taper cut from that\npoint as shown in sketch (d). External Diameters Unequal\nF. Where the external offset does not exceed\n1/2 the thinner section, the transition may be made by welding as shown by\nsketch (e), provided the angle of rise of the weld surface does not exceed 30\ndeg. and both bevel edges are properly fused. G. Where there is an external offset\nexceeding 1/2 the thinner section, that portion of the offset over 1/2t shall\nbe tapered as shown in sketch (f). Internal and External Diameters Unequal\nH. Where there is both an internal and an\nexternal offset, the joint design shall be a combination of sketch (a to f, i.e., Fig. g). Particular attention must be paid to proper alignment under\nthese conditions. Image\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp.
