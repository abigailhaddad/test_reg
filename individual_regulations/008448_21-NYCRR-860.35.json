The ground waters of the basin\nshall not contain substances or properties attributable to the activities of\nman in concentrations or amounts sufficient to endanger or preclude the water\nuses to be protected. (1)\n\nWithin this\nrequirement, the ground waters shall be free from substances or properties in\nconcentrations or combinations which are toxic or harmful to human, animal, plant, or aquatic life, or that produce color, taste or odor of the\nwaters. (2)\n\nConcentrations at any\npoint shall not be degraded by the activities of man to exceed values specified\nby current U.S. Public Health Service Drinking Water Standards. (b) Nondegradation of ground\nwaters. It is the policy of the commission to prevent degradation of ground\nwater quality. In implementing this policy, the commission will require the\nbest water management determined to be practicable. No quality change will be\nconsidered which, in the judgment of the commission, may be injurious to any\ndesignated present or future ground or surface water use. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n860.35\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
