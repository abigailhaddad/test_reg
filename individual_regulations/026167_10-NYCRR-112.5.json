Village of Millbrook\n\nSummary Report\n\nMillbrook Watershed Inventory and Census\n(Revised 1992)\n\nIn order to assess the impact to regulated parties of the proposed watershed rules and regulations, an inventory of the existing land uses within the Millbrook public water supply watershed was conducted by the village. The land use inventory was then compared with the prohibited activities as described in the proposed watershed rules and regulations. The land use inventory was compiled using: 1. A land use survey of the Millbrook watershed conducted in 1988. The individual landowners in the watershed were contacted either in person or by telephone and asked about: current land use; location and number of on-site structures; location, number and content of on-site bulk storage tanks; location, size and type of on-site wastewater treatment facilities; and location, depth and yield of on-site drinking water wells. A copy of the survey form used is attached to this report. [FN1]\n2. The April 1989 list of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites for Dutchess County, prepared by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. B. The January 1990 Quarterly Status Report of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites, prepared by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. 4. The Freedom of Information Law to request information concerning generators of hazardous waste and owners and operators of petroleum and chemical bulk storage facilities. 5. A visual survey. 6. Recent subdivision and site plan maps on file with the Town of Washington Planning Board. Land Use Inventory: As identified through the land use inventory, land uses within the Millbrook public water supply watershed are: Mabbettsville Hamlet\nA veterinarian; bowling alley; proposed retail nursery/landscape operation; ice cream stand; automobile dealership with repair facility; automobile repair shop; professional offices; retail delicatessen; antique shop; apartment building; municipal park with swimming (pond); power equipment dealership building (vacant); and single family dwellings. Outside of the Mabbettsville Hamlet\n\nLarge areas of vacant land either currently used or once used as pasture or cultivation of crops for food or livestock; large lot (greater than 5 acres) single family residences; horse and cattle farms with single family and accessory apartments, barns and outbuildings; tool manufacturer; apartment building; private school; municipal landfill; and private hunting preserve. ANALYSIS: The comparison of land uses within the Millbrook public water supply watershed with the proposed watershed rules and regulations indicates that adoption and implementation of the proposed rules and regulations will not have a detrimental economic impact on landowners within the watershed and will not result in the significant loss of the economic value of any existing residential, commercial or municipal land uses This conclusion is based on the following: [*] In Zone I, any use of the well head protection area other than as a public water supply and for non-intrusive recreation activities such as hunting, fishing, picnicking, nature study and hiking is prohibited. The village of Millbrook owns in fee simple absolute the 119 acre site on which the public water supply infiltration galleries and wells are located. This entire 119 acre parcel is designated Zone I and is under the exclusive control of the village of Millbrook. No economic impact to the use and ownership of the Zone I area is anticipated. [*] In Zone II and Zone III, wastewater treatment works must be properly designed installed and maintained. On-site wastewater treatment, storage and disposal for the individual residential, commercial and municipal land uses within the watershed are provided through individual septic systems. No economic impact to residential, commercial or municipal land uses in Zone II and Zone III as a result of the design, installation and maintenance requirement for wastewater treatment works is anticipated. [*] In Zone II, storage of septage, sludge or human excreta are prohibited. The exception is for storage and disposal of septage, sludge or human excreta associated with a properly functioning wastewater treatment work. No commercial or private sites for storage of septage, sludge or human excreta, other than storage and disposal of wastewater associates with the proper operation of individual wastewater treatment works, were identified by the land use inventory. On-site storage of septage, sludge and human excreta via individual wastewater treatment works for residential, commercial or municipal land uses are permitted within Zone II. No economic impact to residential, commercial or municipal land uses as a result of the prohibition on storage or disposal of septage, sludge or human excreta is anticipated. [*] In Zone II, solid waste management facilities are prohibited. The exception is for disposal areas located within the property boundaries of a single family residence or farm used for disposal of solid waste generated by that single family or farm, and a recycling facility having an on-site capacity not exceeding 450 tons per month. The proposed definition of \"solid waste management facility\" is taken directly from the rules and regulations promulgated by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation regarding solid waste disposal facilities and landfills. (See 6 NYCRR\n360\net seq.). Included in the Part 360 regulations are specific exemptions to the regulations (6 NYCRR\n360-1.7\n(b)) for certain waste disposal and resource separation activities. The proposed Zone II exception to the watershed rules and regulations for disposal areas located within the property boundary of a single family residence or farm, and for recycling facilities having a limited on-site storage capacity, are consistent with the Part 360 regulations and exemptions to the regulations. Only one solid waste management facility within the Zone II boundary, the town of Washington landfill, was identified. The town landfill would be directly affected by adoption and implementation of the proposed watershed rules and regulations. Implementation of the rules and regulations would require closure of the landfill resulting in loss of the use of municipal property and potential hardship on town residents to find alternative waste disposal sites. However, the town of Washington is currently under a consent order to study the closure of the landfill and is actively moving toward preparation of a closure plan. Because the town was undertaken to close the existing landfill and provide for post closure monitoring, the prohibition on solid waste management facilities within Zone II will have no additional adverse economic effect on, town residents or the town of Washington. [*] In Zones II, disposal of hazardous material is prohibited. The proposed rules will not prohibit the storage and use of hazardous material as part of a business process but will prohibit disposal of such material anywhere in the Zone II boundary. No operational sites for commercial or private disposal of hazardous material within Zone II were identified by the land use inventory. Although the inventory identified an automobile dealership located in Mabbettsville as a listed generator of hazardous material, the dealership is required, pursuant to Environmental Conservation Law, to provide for disposal of hazardous material in a permitted hazardous waste disposal facility. There are no permitted hazardous waste disposal facilities located anywhere in the Millbrook public water supply watershed. Thus, the prohibition on disposal of hazardous material in Zone II will have no additional adverse economic effect on existing residential, commercial or municipal land uses. [*] In Zone II, open storage of fertilizer for non-farm and non-residential use is prohibited. No operational open air sites for storage or chemical fertilizer for commercial use were identified by the land use inventory. It should be noted, however, that this prohibition does not prohibit the use of chemical fertilizer but instead regulates the manner in which it is stored. The prohibition, therefore, could impose some minor cost on a landowner to comply with the regulation, but would otherwise limit the lawful use of property. [*] In Zone II, disposal of pesticides, including herbicides, is prohibited. No operational sites for disposal of containers of unused pesticides and herbicides were identified by the land use inventory. Similar to the restriction on open air storage of chemical fertilizers, this prohibition does not limit or prevent the use of pesticides or herbicides but regulates the manner of their disposal. Environmental Conservation Law requires unused or waste pesticides or herbicides be disposed of in a permitted solid waste management facility or a permitted hazardous waste disposal facility as appropriate. [*] In Zone II and Zone III, disposal of water used for make-up water or for washing of equipment used in conjunction with pesticides and herbicides is prohibited. This regulation would prohibit the prospective disposal of water used for make-up water or water used to wash equipment used in conjunction with pesticides and herbicides except pursuant to a NYSDEC authorization.
