  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 20.25 - Bulk tank units\n\nState Regulations\n\nAny handler receiving milk from farms in a tank truck\nshall establish such farms in one or more bulk tank units (hereinafter called\nunits) each consisting of one or more farms, in accordance with provisions of\nthis section. The milk of any farm included in a unit shall be considered for\npricing purposes as having been received by the handler in the unit at the\nnearest point of the township (as determined pursuant to section\n20.52\n[b]\nof this\n\nPart) in which such farm is located. Any handler who receives milk at a pool\nplant or a plant distributing Class I-A milk in the marketing area which is\ndelivered from a farm to such plant in a tank truck shall be deemed to have\nreceived such milk from a unit, pool, partial pool, or nonpool, and any handler\nwho receives bulk milk from a farm in a tank truck containing pool milk shall\nbe deemed to have received such milk from a farm of a unit either pool, partial\npool, or nonpool. (a) Handlers who may\nestablish, maintain, and be responsible for pool units are as follows: (1)\nA handler who operates a pool plant or a\nhandler who operates a plant from which Class I-A milk is distributed in the\nmarketing area other than to another plant: provided, that a handler who is\naffiliated with or is a subsidiary of a handler operating a pool plant may also\noperate pool units if both handlers notify the market administrator in writing\nof such relationship: provided further, that such handler who operates a\ndistributing plant but not a pool plant, to be eligible to maintain a pool unit\nfor any month, must have combined receipts of skim milk and butterfat from such\nunit for such month classified as Classes I-A and I-B in a percentage at least\nas great as the market percentage of pool milk in Classes I-A and I-B for the\nsame month of the preceding year. (2)\nA cooperative handler who does not\noperate a plant but who receives milk from farms in a tank truck and delivers\nsuch milk to plants of other handlers if such cooperative for 12 months has\nbeen qualified as a basis for payments pursuant to section\n20.77\nof this Part or if such\ncooperative has operated a pool unit for 12 consecutive months: provided, that\nsuch cooperative must meet the definition of a cooperative set forth in section\n20.77\n(a)(1). (3)\n\nAny other cooperative handler who does\nnot operate a plant if such cooperative meets the definition of a cooperative\nset forth in section\n20.77\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part subject to the conditions of this section. (4)\n\nFor the months specified in subparagraph\n(i) or (ii) of this paragraph, any other handler operating a unit in any of the\nmonths of April, May, or June which unit had for such month any skim milk or\nbutterfat classified as Class I-A milk in the marketing area (on some basis\nother than failure to account for such milk) and had a total Class I-A and\n\nClass I-B classification in a percentage at least as great as the market\npercentage of pool milk in Classes I-A and I-B for the same month in the\npreceding year. (i) Such month. (ii)\n\nEach of the months through March\nfollowing such month except for any month when the Class I-B or combined Class\nI-A and Class I-B of such unit is less than 60 percent. (b) The handler may establish the\nunits in any manner chosen by him, subject to the following limitations: (1)\n\nEach unit shall have a headquarters where\nthe basic record of receipts and butterfat tests of milk from each farm are\nmaintained and where there is maintained the basic record of each receipt and\neach delivery of milk by each tank truck receiving milk from farms of the unit\nand related details with respect to the movement of such milk. (2)\n\nEach unit shall be given a name\nindicating the general geographic area in which farms comprising such unit are\nlocated. (3)\n\nThe handler shall\ndeclare whether each unit is to be operated as a pool unit. Farms from which\nthe milk is to be pooled shall be established in a separate unit from those\nwhich are not to be pooled. (4)\n\nFarms in the area specified in subdivision (e) of this section shall be in\nunits separate from farms in the area specified in subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (c) Except as\nset forth in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this subdivision, a handler may\ndeclare that a unit is to be operated as a pool unit and at any time may add a\nfarm to a pool unit, that a handler pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this\nsection may not add farms to a pool unit during the months of July through\n\nMarch unless such handler's Class I-A skim milk or butterfat utilization\nexceeds the total receipts of skim milk or butterfat, respectively, in milk\nfrom the pool unit, and in the latter case he may add only the smallest number\nof farms necessary to provide sufficient milk to cover such Class I-A\nutilization. (1)\n\nIf the unit is a declared\nnonpool unit or if the farm is a part of a declared nonpool unit of such\nhandler, the unit or farm may be changed to a pool status, except as excluded\nfrom the pool milk definition pursuant to section\n20.14\n(d) of this\n\nPart, only beginning the first day of a month upon notice to the market\nadministrator by not later than the 10th day of such month. If the notice is\nfiled after the 10th day of the month, the effective date shall be the first\nday of the following month except as specified in paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nIn the period of\n\nDecember through June, no new pool unit may be established, no nonpool or\npartial pool unit may be declared to be a pool unit, and no farm may be added\nto a pool unit if the handler caused, as specified in subdivision (d) of this\nsection, any pool unit or any farm of a pool unit to become nonpool in the\nperiod of July through November immediately preceding: provided, that this\nlimitation shall not prevent the handler from including in a pool unit a farm\nwhich for the first time has converted from can delivery to bulk tank delivery\nand from which the handler received as pool milk all milk delivered by such\nfarm in cans for a period of 30 days immediately preceding: provided further, that, except in the case set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, this\nparagraph shall not be applicable if the farm which is caused to become nonpool\nthereby becomes a producer farm under another order with a provision for\nmarketwide equalization. (3)\n\nNo\nfarm which was caused to become nonpool may be made a part of a pool unit by a\nhandler set forth in subparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph until\nafter the passage of a complete April-May-June period following the time such\nfarm was caused to become nonpool: (i) The\nhandler who caused the farm to become nonpool. (ii)\n\nThe handler or other person who received\nthe milk as nonpool milk. (iii)\nA\nhandler who is substantially under the same management control, or ownership as\nthe handler or other person set forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this\nparagraph. (iv)\nA handler who\nreceives the milk through arrangement with the handler or other person set\nforth in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph. (4)\nA handler may transfer a farm\nfrom one pool unit to another of his pool units on the first day of any month\nupon notice to the market administrator by not later than the 10th day of such\nmonth. (5)\nA farm shall\nautomatically be added to a pool unit or a nonpool unit and shall automatically\nbecome a pool unit effective the first day of any month in which any of the\nskim milk or butterfat in milk of such farm or unit is assigned pursuant to\nsection\n20.45\nof this Part to Class I-A\nmilk unless the handler is precluded from doing so pursuant to paragraph (2) or\n(3) of this subdivision or unless such milk is considered producer milk under\nanother order with a provision for marketwide equalization. If some but not all\nskim milk or butterfat in milk received from such farms previously a part of a\nnonpool unit is assigned to Class I-A milk the handler operating such unit has\nuntil the time of filing the report required pursuant to section\n20.30\nof this Part to specify which\nfarms are to be added to a pool unit and if upon verification by audit the\nmarket administrator finds that other skim milk or butterfat in milk of a\ndeclared nonpool unit is assigned to Class I-A milk, the handler operating such\nunit has until 10 days after notification by the market administrator to\nspecify which farms are to be added to a pool unit. In absence of such\nspecification, all eligible farms shall be added to the pool unit. (d) A handler may cause a pool\nunit or a farm which is a part of a pool unit to become nonpool by the methods\nset forth in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subdivision; provided, that the\nfailure of a unit to meet the pool requirements set forth in subdivision (f) of\nthis section shall not be considered for purposes of this subdivision to be a\nchange of pool status caused by the handler; provided further, that a handler\npursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section must continue in a pool unit any\nfarm which was a part of such handler's pool unit in any of the months of\n\nApril, May, or June preceding from which he receives milk or from which any\nother handler receives milk through arrangement with him; provided further, that if a unit operated by a handler is reported by another handler which is a\ncooperative, the actions specified in paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) of this\nsubdivision must be concurred in by such cooperative handler. (1)\n\nThe handler may change the status of a\ndeclared pool unit to a declared nonpool unit effective the first day of any\nmonth upon notice to the market administrator by not later than the 10th day of\nsuch month. If the notice is filed after the 10th day of the month, the\neffective date shall be the first day of the following month. (2)\n\nThe handler may transfer a farm from a\npool unit to a nonpool unit effective the first day of any month upon notice to\nthe market administrator by not later than the 10th day of such month. If the\nnotice is filed after the 10th day of the month, the effective date shall be\nthe first day of the following month. (3)\n\nThe handler may so operate a unit located\nin the area specified in subdivision (e) of this section that its pool status\nis cancelled pursuant to section\n20.27\nof this Part. (4)\n\nThe handler may arrange for the milk of a\nfarm in his pool unit to be delivered to another person as nonpool milk. Any\ndelivery of milk by a farm in a handler's pool unit to another person as\nnonpool milk shall be considered to have been arranged by such handler unless\nsuch handler can establish that such other person is not substantially under\nthe same management, control, or ownership as such handler and that such\nhandler was in no way a party to such nonpool delivery. (e) A declared pool unit must be operated to\nmeet the requirements set forth in section\n20.26\nof this Part if the farms of\nsuch unit are located in the following areas: New York, New Jersey, the\ncounties of Addison, Rutland, and Bennington in Vermont, the county of\n\nBerkshire in Massachusetts, or in Pennsylvania. Failure to meet such\nrequirements shall make such declared pool unit subject to suspension and\ncancellation pursuant to the procedure set forth in section\n20.27. This subdivision shall not\nbe applicable to a cooperative handler specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this\nsection. (f) A declared pool unit\nmade up of forms located outside the area specified in subdivision (e) of this\nsection or a declared pool unit made up of farms specified in subdivision (e)\nof this section and operated by a cooperative handler specified in paragraph\n(a)(3) of this section shall be a pool unit in the months of July through March\nif at least 25 percent of the milk in such unit is delivered in such month to\npool plants, and shall be a pool unit in the months of April through June only\nif 60 percent of the milk of such unit was received at pool plants during the\nperiod of October through December immediately preceding or if such handler\nreceived no milk of such unit or from farms of such unit in the preceding\n\nOctober through December. (g) Any\nunit declared to be a pool unit shall be designated a pool unit in any month, (1) if the handler is qualified in such month pursuant to subdivision (a) of\nthis section, (2) if such unit meets all the requirements of this section\napplicable to it to be a pool unit, or (3) if the designation of such unit has\nnot been cancelled pursuant to section\n20.27\nof this Part. (h) Each handler shall report by not later\nthan the 10th day of the month any changes in units during the preceding month\nand as of the first day of such month. (i) Whenever the market administrator finds\nthat a handler has received bulk tank milk from a farm required to be included\nin an established unit but which has not been so included, he shall tentatively\nassign such farm to a unit and promptly notify the handler of such action. Unless otherwise requested by the handler within 10 days of such notice, the\ntentative assignment by the market administrator will become final. (j) Whenever the market administrator finds\nthat a handler has caused milk to become nonpool pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)\nof this section he shall promptly notify the handler of such finding. Within 10\ndays of such notice the handler may, except as to any such milk pooled under\nanother order, (1) make a written claim that the failure to include the milk\ninvolved as pool milk was an error and, in such event, the market administrator\nshall pool such milk and rescind his finding, or (2) make a written offer to\nsubmit proof that he had not caused such milk to become nonpool. In the latter\nevent, the market administrator shall examine such proof and shall either\nrescind his original finding or confirm it. Failure to respond to the market\nadministrator's notice shall be deemed to confirm the finding. (k) Units other than those which are pool\nunits pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section shall be designated partial\npool units if they meet the provisions set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of\nthis subdivision. (1)\n\nAny nonpool unit which\nwould have been automatically made a pool unit pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of\nthis section except that the handler is precluded from adding farms thereof to\na pool unit pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section. If a unit of a\nhandler becomes a partial pool unit pursuant to this paragraph, all of the\nhandler's pool units and partial pool units shall be combined and the skim milk\nand butterfat in milk of the partial pool units assigned to Class II and Class\nIII of such combined total prior to any skim milk and butterfat in the partial\npool unit milk being assigned to Class I-A. (2)\n\nAny unit the milk of which fails to meet\nthe pooling requirements of subdivision (f) of this section, or any unit\noperated by a handler not specified in subdivision (a) of this section, as\nbeing eligible to establish and maintain pool units, or any unit made up of\nfarms located in the 401 miles and over freight zone unless the handlers\noperating such unit are eligible to establish a pool unit and has specifically\nrequested such unit to be so designated. (l) The market administrator shall publicly\nannounce the names of handlers establishing pool units and the names and\nheadquarters of such units. He shall also publicly announce any change in the\npool status of such units, and the names of handlers who are ineligible to add\nfarms to a pool unit under the terms set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this\nsection.
