Such program can be provided in\nthe person's home, including an adult care facility other than a shelter for\nadults, or in the home of a responsible relative or other responsible\nadult. (2)\n(i) AIDS home care program (AHCP) means a\ncoordinated plan of care and services provided at home to persons who are\nmedically eligible for placement in a hospital or an RHCF and who are diagnosed\nby a physician as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related illness as defined by the AIDS Institute\nof the State Department of Health. Such definitions are contained in directives\nissued by the department from time to time.

If the\nperson desires to remain and is deemed by his or her physician able to remain\nin his or her own home if the necessary services are provided, such person or\nhis or her representative must so inform the local social services official, who must authorize an assessment under the provisions of section\n3616\nof the\n\nPublic Health Law and paragraph (2) of this subdivision. If the results of the\nassessment indicate that the person can receive the appropriate level of care\nat home, the official must prepare for that person a plan for the provision of\nservices comparable to services that would be rendered in a hospital or an\nRHCF, as appropriate for the person. In developing such plan, the official must\nconsult with those persons performing the assessment and must assure that such\nplan is appropriate to the person's needs and will result in an efficient use\nof services. (2)\n\nIf a\nperson who has been assessed in accordance with section\n505.9\n(b) of this\n\nPart by a LTHHCP or an AHCP, a physician or discharge planner or, at the option\nof the social services district, another certified home health agency, as\nneeding care in an RHCF or a hospital, desires to remain and is deemed by his\nor her physician able to remain in his/her own home or the home of a\nresponsible relative or other responsible adult or an adult care facility, other than a shelter for adults, if the necessary services are provided and, for purposes of an adult care facility, the person meets the admission and\ncontinued stay criteria for such facility, the social services district must\nauthorize a home assessment of the appropriateness of LTHHCP or AHCP services. The assessment must include, in addition to the physician's recommendation, an\nevaluation of the social and environmental needs of the person. The assessment\nwill serve as a basis for the development of an appropriate plan of care for\nthe person. (i) If the person is in a\nhospital or an RHCF, the home assessment must be performed by the person's\nphysician, the discharge coordinator of the hospital or RHCF referring the\nperson, a representative of the social services district, and a representative\nof the LTHHCP or AHCP that will provide services to the person. (ii)\n\nIf the person is in his/her own home, the home assessment must be authorized by the social services district and must\nbe performed by the person's physician, a representative of the social services\ndistrict, and a representative of the LTHHCP or AHCP that will provide services\nto the person. (iii)\n\nThe assessment\nmust be completed prior to or within 30 days after the provision of services\nbegins. Payment for services provided prior to the completion of the assessment\nmay be made only if it is determined, based upon such assessment, that the\nperson qualifies for such services. (iv)\n\nIf the person is in an adult care\nfacility, the home assessment must be performed by representatives of the\nLTHHCP or AHCP and the social services district in consultation with the\noperator of the adult care facility. (v) Persons provided LTHHCP or AHCP services\nin adult care facilities must meet the admission and continued stay criteria\nfor such facilities.

(4)\n\nAt the time of the\ninitial assessment, and at the time of each subsequent assessment performed for\na LTHHCP, or more often if the person's needs require it, the social services\ndistrict must establish a monthly budget in accordance with which payment will\nbe authorized. The social services district must provide the operator of the\nadult care facility with a copy of the completed assessment, the plan of care\nand the monthly budget.

(c) When the monthly\nbudget prepared for a person who is the sole member of his/her household in the\nprogram is for an amount less than 75 percent of monthly rates payable for RHCF\nservices, a \"credit\" may be accrued on behalf of the person. If a continuing\nassessment of the person's needs demonstrates that he/she requires increased\nservices, the social services district may authorize any amount accrued during\nthe past 12 months over the 75-percent maximum. When the monthly budget\nprepared for two members of the same household is for an amount less than 75\npercent of monthly rates payable for RHCF services, a \"credit\" may be accrued\non behalf of the household. If a continuing assessment of the household's needs\ndemonstrates that the household requires increased services, the social\nservices district may authorize any amount accrued during the past 12 months\nover the 75-percent maximum. (d) When the monthly budget prepared for a person or a household is for an amount\nless than 75 percent of monthly rates payable for RHCF services, and the\ncontinuing assessment of the person's or household's needs demonstrates that\nthe person or household requires increased services in an amount less than 10\npercent of the prepared monthly budget, but totaling no more than 75 percent of\nthe monthly rates payable for RHCF services, the LTHHCP may provide such\nservices without prior approval of the social services district. (e) If an assessment of the person's or\nhousehold's needs demonstrates that the person or household requires services, the payment for which would exceed such monthly maximum, but it can be\nreasonably anticipated that total expenditures for required services for such\nperson or household will not exceed such maximum calculated over a one-year\nperiod, the social services official may authorize payment for such\nservices. (ii)\n\nFor\npersons residing in adult care facilities but not receiving AHCP services: (a) The budget must include all of the\nservices to be provided in accordance with the coordinated plan of health care\nby the LTHHCP.

(c) When the monthly budget prepared for a\nperson residing in an adult care facility is for an amount less than 50 percent\nof the average of the monthly rates for RHCF services, a \"credit\" may be\naccrued on behalf of the person. If a continuing assessment of the person's\nneeds demonstrates that he/she requires increased services, the social services\ndistrict may authorize the expenditure of any amount accrued during the past 12\nmonths provided that such amount, when added to the amount previously expended, does not exceed the 50 percent maximum. (d) When the monthly budget prepared for a\nperson residing in an adult care facility is less than 50 percent of the\nmonthly rates payable for RHCF services, and the continuing assessment of the\nperson's needs demonstrates that he/she requires increased services in an\namount less than 10 percent of the prepared monthly budget, but totaling no\nmore than 50 percent of the monthly rates payable for RHCF services, the LTHHCP\nmay provide such services without prior approval of the local social services\ndistrict. (e) If an assessment of\nthe needs of an adult care facility resident demonstrates that services are\nrequired, the payment for which would exceed the monthly maximum specified in\nclause (b) of this subparagraph, but it can be reasonably anticipated that\ntotal expenditures for required services for such person will not exceed such\nmaximum calculated over a one-year period, the social services official may\nauthorize payment for such services. (iii)\n\nFor persons receiving AHCP services, total monthly expenditures for such services are not subject to the\nrequirements of subparagraph (4)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nIf a joint assessment by the\nsocial services district and the provider of services under this paragraph\nindicates that the maximum expenditure permitted under paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision is not sufficient to provide LTHHCP services to persons with\nspecial needs, social services officials may authorize, pursuant to the\nprovisions of section\n367-c\n(3-a)\nof the Social Services Law, maximum\nmonthly expenditures for such persons, not to exceed 100 percent of the average\nRHCF rate established for that district. In addition, if a continuing\nassessment of a person with special needs demonstrates that he/she requires\nincreased services, a social services official may authorize the expenditure of\nany amount which has accrued under this section during the past 12 months as a\nresult of the expenditures for a person participating in the LTHHCP not having\nexceeded such maximum. If an assessment of a person with special needs\ndemonstrates that he/she requires increased services, the payment for which\nwould exceed such monthly maximum, the social services official may authorize\npayment for such services if it can reasonably be anticipated that the total\nexpenditures for the required services for such a person will not exceed the\nmaximum calculated over a one-year period.

(ii)\n\nThe number of persons with special needs\nfor whom a social services official may authorize payment for services pursuant\nto this paragraph is limited to 25 percent of the total number of LTHHCP\nclients which a social services district is authorized to serve; provided that\nin any district containing a city having a population of one million or more, such limit is 15 percent. (iii)\n\nIn\nthe event that a district reaches the limitation specified in this\nsubparagraph, the social services official may, upon approval by the\ncommissioner, authorize payment for services pursuant to this subdivision for\nadditional persons with special needs. (iv)\n\nThe social services official must seek\napproval for authorization to serve additional persons with special needs by\nsubmitting a written request to the commissioner which demonstrates that the\nprovisions of this paragraph have (a) met the needs of individuals who could\nnot otherwise be served through the LTHHCP; (b) diverted clients from\nresidential health care facility admission; or (c) permitted the admission of\nclients on alternate care status into the LTHHCP. (v) Social services districts are responsible\nfor the retention of information deemed necessary by the department to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of raising the limitation on expenditures for the delivery of\nlong term home health care services, and for compliance with reporting\nrequirements established by the department. (vi)\n\nThe provisions of this paragraph remain\nin effect until December 31, 1993.
