  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 79.23 - Medium duty vehicles\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section contains additional requirements for the\ninspection of vehicles with maximum gross weights over 10,000 pounds up to and\nincluding 18,000 pounds, which shall be known as medium duty vehicles but not\nincluding those vehicles for which the registrants request heavy vehicle\ninspection. The vehicles subject to inspection under this section are also\nsubject to procedures found in section\n79.21\nof this Part, in addition to\nthe following: (a) Brake\nsystem. Procedure\n\nReject\nif: 1. Brake equalization. Each vehicle shall be tested for\nbrake equalization before and after a wheel is pulled. This test must be done\non a hard level surface, free from loose material (indoors and outdoors), or on\na brake equalization machine. At least one rearmost factory-equipped axle brake\ndrum or hub and drum assembly must be removed unless the brake backing plate is\ndesigned to allow the inspection of all brake lining thickness and drum\ncondition. It is not necessary to remove a front wheel. If disassembly is not\nrequired, the second brake equalization test may be omitted. 1. The vehicle fails to stop without significant\npull. Visually inspect the brake system. 2. Determine how the brakes are applied (parking and\nservice). 2. There are not two separate means of brake application\nor these two separate means of applying the service and parking brakes are\nconnected in any way, so that failure on any one part leaves the vehicle\nwithout brakes. The parking brake operating control is not separate from the\nservice brake control. 3. Inspect for presence of brakes on all wheels. 3. There are missing or inoperative brakes on any wheel\nexcept for the following: 1980 or older trucks and tractors which have three or\nmore factory-equipped axles, in some cases, may not have brakes on the front\naxle. These vehicles should not be rejected unless there is evidence that front\nbrakes existed (\ni.e., drums or backing plate assemblies are\npresent). 4. Inspect for a single pedal capable of operating all\nthe brakes, if vehicle is designated as a 1954 or newer model. 4. The vehicle is not equipped with a single brake pedal\nor the pedal does not operate all the service brakes on the motor vehicle or\ncombination of vehicles. (This does not prohibit the use of an additional valve\nto operate the trailer brakes independently.)\n5. Inspect all brake hoses, tubes and connecting lines. Look for proper support. Be sure lines are secure and cannot chafe on the\nframe, axles, exhaust system or other lines. 5. There is a break, crimp or crack in any brake hose, line, tube or connection. Any line is not secured or is chafed by moving parts\nor in contact with the exhaust system. Linings and\n\nPads\n6. Inspect for any broken or cracked drum brake linings\nor disc brake pads or parts of linings or pads which are not firmly attached. Also inspect for contamination and excessively uneven lining wear. 6. Friction material is broken, cracked or not firmly\nand completely attached, or if friction surface is contaminated with oil, grease, etc., or, if there is metal-to-metal contact or if the disc brake pad\nwear sensor is activated. 7. Bonded drum linings. Measure the lining thickness at\nthe thinnest point. 7. Thinnest point is less than [ 3. 8. Bolted or riveted drum linings. Inspect for loose or\nmissing bolts or rivets. Measure lining's thickness. 8. Any rivets or bolts are loose or missing. Lining is worn to less than\n1\n/\n32\n3 above a rivet or bolt\nhead if bolt is less than\n3\n/\n8\n\" diameter. If lining is\nsecured to the shoe with\n3\n/\n8\ndiameter bolt, minimum lining thickness must not be less than\n5\n/\n16\n\". Measurements should be\ntaken at a point nearest the center of the shoe. Drums and\n\nRotors\n9. Discs-Inspect discs for mechanical damage and cracks\nextending to the edge. 9. The disc is broken or has cracks on the friction\nsurface extending to the open edge or if the mounting holes are elongated. (Heat check cracks not extending to the open edge may be ignored.)\n10. Drums-Inspect friction surface for cracks extending\nto the open edge or drum or if it has mechanical damage other than normal wear\nor the surface is contaminated. 10. Drum has a crack on the friction surface extending to\nthe open edge or on the outside of the drum, particularly at the drum mounting\narea. (Heat check cracks not extending to the open edge may be ignored.)\n\nThere is evidence of mechanical damage other than\nnormal wear, or the mounting holes are elongated or the friction surface is\ncontaminated with grease, oil, etc. Hydraulic Brake\n\nSystems\n11. Inspect wheel cylinders, lines, connections and\ncalipers for visible leakage. 11. Wheel cylinders, lines or calipers have visible\nleaks. 12. Inspect master cylinder for leakage and reservoir\nfluid level. 12. Master cylinder leaks or reservoir is not full to its\ndesigned capacity. 13. Test pedal reserve. While vehicle is stopped, depress\nbrake pedal under normal foot pressure (if vehicle is equipped with power\nbrakes, engine should be running for this test). Also, inspect for leakage\nunder pressure. 13. Pedal reserve is less than S of the possible travel\nor manufacturer's specifications; brake pedal does not hold its position for at\nleast 60 seconds without dropping; leaks are visible. 14. Power-assisted systems. With engine off, apply brakes\nseveral times to deplete reserve supply. 14. Pedal does not drop slightly when engine starts. Put foot on pedal and start engine. Air Brake\n\nSystems\n15. Inspect lines, valves, fittings and air chambers for\nleaks. 15. If the air pressure does not maintain between 80 and\n90 psi. (perform this test for 1 minute on single and/or combination\nvehicles). Note: The following four conditions\nmust be met before performing this test: -governor is cut in; -reservoir pressure is between\n80 and 90 psi; -engine is at idle; and -service brakes are fully applied. 16. Inspect air pressure safety relief valve, tension and\ncondition of compressor drive belts; check air intake cleaner. 16. Air pressure safety relief is not present or does not\noperate on systems which can be checked. (Some valves are designed with a lead\nplug which cannot be tested.)\n\nCompressor drive belt(s) are missing, badly worn, frayed or loose. Air compressor intake is clogged to the point of\npreventing proper air intake. 17. Air and vacuum warning system gauges- make a series\nof brake applications until low pressure warning signal operates. 17. Gauge is missing or inoperative. Vehicle is not\nequipped with either an audible or visible warning device to readily indicate\nto the driver the lack of sufficient assist to stop the vehicle. (a gauge does\nnot satisfy this requirement.)\n\nAir System: Warning system does not provide a continuous warning\nonce activated or does not activate when pressure drops: (i) to manufacturer's specifications, if known, or\n(ii) below 60 pounds per square inch (42.4 kg/sq cm), if manufacturer's specifications are unknown. Vacuum System: Warning system does not activate when the vacuum\nreservoir has less than eight inches of mercury. 18. Inspect for presence of an emergency breakaway system\non all trailers. 18. Trailer is not equipped with breakaway brakes which\nautomatically apply upon separation from the towing vehicle. 19. Inspect for presence of a tractor protection valve on\ntowing vehicles manufactured after June 30, 1953. 19. Vehicle is not equipped with an automatic breakaway\nsystem (tractor protection valve) so that the service brakes on the truck or\ntractor can still operate if the trailer separates. This valve must\nautomatically operate within a pressure range of 20-45 psi (14.1-31.8 kg/sq\ncm). Where manual operation is permitted, this control shall be within easy\nreach of the driver. (b) Coupling devices. Procedure\n\nReject\nif: 1. Pintle hooks\nA. Condition\n-Cracks anywhere in pintle hooks assembly\n-Any welded repairs to the pintle hook\n-Section reduction visible when coupled (see Note\n1)\n\nNote 1: No part of the\nhorn or hook (stationary part) should have any section reduced by more than 20\npercent. If wear can be seen when the hook and eye are coupled, it is due to\neither this condition or the eye condition described in Note 2. B. Operation\n\nLatch does not work\n2. Drawbar/towbar eye\nA. Condition\n-Any cracks in attachment welds\ni. Mounting\n-Any missing or ineffective fasteners\nii. Integrity\n-Any cracks\n-Section reduction visible when coupled (see Note\n2)\n\nNote 2: The eye should\nnot be worn to beyond 20 percent of its original cross section thickness. If\nwear can be seen when the hook and eye are coupled, it is probable that either\nthis condition or that described in Note 1 exists. 3. Drawbar/towbar tongue\nA. Condition\nA. Any cracks. B. Operation\nB. Movement of 1/4 inch or more between subframe and\ndrawbar at point of attachment. 4. Safety chains and cable\nA. Presence of safety chains\nA. Missing\nB. Condition\n(i) Chains and hooks\n-Worn to the extent of a measurable reduction in link\ncross section. -Incapable of secure attachment. -Improper repairs, including welding, wire, small\nbolts, rope and tape. (ii) Cable\n-Kinked or broken cable strands. -Incapable of secure attachment. -Improper clamps or clamping. (c) Exhaust system. Procedure\n\nReject\nif: Exhaust system. 1. Visually inspect for presence, condition and location\nof exhaust system. 1. Vehicle has no muffler, exhaust pipe, tail pipe or\ntail spout. Vehicle has gutted, altered or patched muffler. Vehicle has exhaust noise appreciably greater than\nmechanical noise of fan and valves. There is excessive vibration of exhaust line. There is leakage of exhaust gases at: a. Manifold gasket. b. Manifold and exhaust pipe gaskets. c. Muffler and muffler connection. d. Any point in exhaust pipe and tail pipe. Exhaust system is so located as would be likely to\nresult in burning, charring or damaging the electric wiring, fuel supply or any\ncombustible part of the vehicle. Exhaust system does not discharge to the atmosphere\nat a location to the rear of the cab (if the exhaust projects above the cab, it\nmust be near the rear of the cab). Motor vehicles engaged in the transportation\nof inflammable liquids are excluded from the requirements of this\nprovision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
