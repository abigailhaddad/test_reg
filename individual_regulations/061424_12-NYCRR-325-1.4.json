  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 325-1.4 - Authorization for special services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Authorization for medical care in\naccepted or established claims. (1)\n\nWhen it\nis necessary for the attending provider to provide or prescribe medical care or\nsupplies costing more than $1,000, he or she must request and secure\nauthorization from the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator, by setting forth the medical necessity of the special services\nrequired in the electronic format prescribed by the Chair. Such requests are\nnot required in an emergency or for pre-authorized procedures as set forth in\nsubdivision (d) of this section and section\n324.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n(i) This section also applies to hospitals, specialists, consultants and surgeons, who are actually engaged to perform such\nservices. (ii)\n\nFor the services of\na physician assistant, the supervising physician shall make the request for\nauthorization for special services. (3)\n\nThe treating provider seeking\nauthorization shall inform the claimant of the request for prior authorization\n(PAR: Non-MTG Over $1,000) (hereinafter \"PAR\") and submit the PAR in the manner\nprescribed by the Chair, which may be electronic. The treating provider shall\nnot submit a PAR for the same special service multiple times without any change\nof the claimant's medical condition. (4)\n\nInsurance carriers, self-insured employer\nor third-party administrators shall provide the Chair or his or her designee in\nthe manner prescribed by the Chair with the name and contact information for\nthe point(s) of contact for PAR review. Such contact information may include\nthe contacts' direct telephone number(s) and email address(es). i. If the designated point(s) of contact\nchanges at any time for any reason, the insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third-party administrator shall notify the Chair or his or her\ndesignee of such change in the manner prescribed by the Chair. ii. The list of designated points of contact\nfor each insurance carrier, self-insured employer and third-party administrator\nshall be maintained by the Board electronically. When a treating medical\nprovider submits a PAR electronically, it shall be directed to the appropriate\ncontact person. Any change in the designated contact shall not be effective\nuntil the designated contact information has been updated in the Board's\nelectronic records. iii. In the\nevent that a carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator fails\nto provide the Chair or his or her designee with such name and contact\ninformation (in the manner prescribed), or provides incorrect or incomplete\ncontact information during initial registration or when updating pursuant to\nsubparagraph (1) of this subdivision, such carrier, self-insured employer or\nthird-party administrator may be subject to: (a) Orders of the Chair granting any PAR\nsubmitted during such time when the name and contact information is missing, incomplete or incorrect; and\n(b) Penalties issued pursuant to section\n114-a\n(3)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law for\nevery case, where a PAR was requested. (5)\n\nIn response to a PAR related to an\nestablished or accepted body part or illness, the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator may have the claimant\nexamined within four business days if the claimant is hospitalized or 30 days\nif patient is not hospitalized, by an appropriate specialist who is authorized\nby the Chair, to conduct independent medical examinations of workers'\ncompensation claimants. In the event the PAR is submitted prior to creation of\na workers' compensation case by the Board in accordance with 300.37(a) of this\n\nChapter, the PAR will be promptly reviewed by the Board to identify the proper\ncarrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator. Upon such\nidentification, the PAR will be directed by the Board to the proper carrier, self-insured employer, or third-party administrator, who shall have 15 calendar\ndays (or 30 calendar days in the event of an IME) to approve, partially approve\nor deny the request. In the event the PAR is submitted after creation of a\nworkers' compensation case by the Board in accordance with 300.37(a) of this\n\nChapter but prior to filing the mandatory first report of injury pursuant to\nsection\n300.22\n(b) of this\n\nChapter that identifies a third-party administrator responsible for handling\nthe claim, the request may be directed to a third-party administrator that has\nbeen designated by the carrier or self-insured employer as handling all or a\nportion of its workers' compensation claims and identified by the Board as the\nthird-party administrator where such requests will be directed. Such\nthird-party administrator shall have 30 calendar days to approve, partially\napprove or deny the request. In the event the PAR is submitted after the\nmandatory first report of injury pursuant to section\n300.22\n(b) of this\n\nChapter shall become due and no such report has been filed, the Board may issue\nan Order of the Chair or Notice of Resolution granting the requested treatment. (i) If such specialist is not available or\nwhere the claimant resides outside of state, consultation may be rendered by a\nqualified provider who may conduct the independent medical examination as\nprovided in Workers' Compensation Law section 137 (3) (a) and section\n300.2\n(b)(9) and\n(d)(7)\nof this Title. (ii)\n\nWhen a case is closed, disallowed or\ncancelled, where ongoing medical treatment is resolved by an agreement pursuant\nto section\n32\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law, the carrier, self-insured employer or\nthird-party administrator may deny the prior authorization request within 15\ndays without an independent medical examination; however, nothing herein shall\nprohibit a carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator from\nobtaining an opinion from an independent medical examiner. When a PAR is denied\nwithout an IME, there shall be no review by the Medical Director's Office. A\nclaimant may request review by the Board by filing a Request for Further\n\nAction, that demonstrates that the basis for denial is factually inaccurate. The Board may respond to such requests for review by letter or by referral to\nadjudication, as appropriate in the discretion of the Chair or his or her\ndesignee. (6)\n\nThe\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator shall\nrespond to the PAR in the format prescribed by the Chair within 30 days. ** If the PAR has been denied, the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator shall submit with the\nwritten response a report offering a conflicting opinion from an independent\nmedical examiner, a qualified medical professional as defined in section\n300.2\n(b)(9)\nof\nthis Title, or, if the report was made upon review of the records without a\nphysical examination, a physician authorized to treat workers' compensation\nclaimants. If the report offering a conflicting opinion is already contained in\nthe Board file, the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator shall not submit the report but shall identify the report on the\nform prescribed by the Chair by providing the name of the independent medical\nexaminer, qualified medical professional as defined in section\n300.2\n(b)(9)\nof\nthis Title, or physician authorized to treat workers' compensation claimants\nwho gave the conflicting opinion, the date of the report, and the date it was\nreceived by the Board. Nothing herein shall relieve the carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third-party administrator from complying with the provisions of\nsection\n300.23\nof this Title. The carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator shall send the claimant\nnotice of the approval, partial approval or denial of the PAR. Failure to send\nthe claimant such notice may result in penalties under section 25(3)(e), for\nfailure to file a required report with the Board, and section\n13-a\n(6)(a)\nof the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw\n(7)\n\nIf such\nauthorization or denial is not submitted to the treating provider within 30\ncalendar days, such request may be deemed authorized and the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator shall be liable for payment\nfor such special service. The Chair may issue an order stating that such\nrequest is deemed authorized or requiring the carrier, self-insured employer or\nthird-party administrator to provide written authorization, if such\ndocumentation is required by the claimant to secure necessary medical treatment\nand the carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator shall be\nsubject to a penalty pursuant to section\n25\n(3)(e)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. Such\norder of the Chair is not appealable under Workers' Compensation Law section\n23. (8)\n(i) Upon the timely receipt of a denial of a\nPAR and a report offering a conflicting opinion from an independent medical\nexaminer, a qualified medical professional as defined in section\n300.2\n(b)(9)\nof\nthis Title, or, if the report was made upon review of the records without a\nphysical examination, a physician authorized to treat workers' compensation\nclaimants, the Board shall order the claim into the Expedited Hearing Process\nwherein an expedited hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days. Notice of the\nexpedited hearing shall provide that the parties may depose the claimant's\ntreating provider and the independent medical examiner, qualified medical\nprofessional, or physician authorized to treat workers' compensation claimants\nwho submitted the conflicting medical report at or prior to the hearing. If the\nphysicians are deposed, transcripts shall be provided to the Board on or before\nthe hearing. If the claimant is unrepresented the testimony of claimant's\ntreating provider and the independent medical examiner shall be taken at a\nhearing. For good cause shown, the Workers' Compensation Law Judge may grant an\nadjournment if one or both of the medical professionals cannot be deposed and\ntranscripts prior to the Board at or prior to the hearing, or if one or both of\nthe medical professionals cannot appear to testify at the expedited hearing. The Workers' Compensation Law Judge shall rule on the PAR at the expedited\nhearing and file a subsequent decision, or shall issue a reserved decision on\nthe issue within 15 days of the expedited hearing date. The case shall not be\ncontinued for further development of the record except where there are complex\nmedical issues of diagnosis or causation present and then it shall be continued\nfor no more than 30 days. (ii)\n\nIf\nthe form prescribed by the Chair denying the PAR is untimely or does not\nreference or have attached a conflicting medical report from an independent\nmedical examiner, a qualified medical professional as defined in section\n300.2\n(b)(9)\nof\nthis Title, or, if the report was made upon review of the records without a\nphysical examination, a physician authorized to treat workers' compensation\nclaimants, the Chair will issue an order stating that such PAR is deemed\nauthorized. Such order of the Chair is not appealable under Workers'\nCompensation Law section 23. (9)\n\nPursuant to Workers' Compensation Law\nsection 13-a (4)(b), claimants shall cooperate in an examination by the\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator's\nindependent medical examiner. If a claimant fails to attend an examination\nscheduled in accordance with Workers' Compensation Law section 137 and section\n300.2\nof this Title at a medical\nfacility convenient to the claimant during the 30 day authorization time\nperiod, the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator may file the form prescribed by the Chair along with\ncontemporaneous supporting evidence that claimant failed to attend a scheduled\nmedical examination pursuant to the provisions of Workers' Compensation Law\nsection 137. Upon receipt of the form prescribed by the Chair for this purpose\nand the contemporaneous supporting evidence of failure to attend the scheduled\nmedical examination, the Board shall order the claim into the Expedited Hearing\n\nProcess wherein an expedited hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days on the\nrequest for prior authorization and the claimant's failure to attend the\nindependent medical examination. (10)\n\nSuch authorization is not required in an\nemergency under the provisions of Workers' Compensation Law section 13-a\n(5). (b) Authorization\nfor medical care when the right to compensation is controverted or the body\npart or condition has not been established. (1)\n\nWhen it is necessary for the treating\nprovider to secure specialist consultations, surgical operations, physiotherapeutic or occupational therapy procedures, x-ray examinations or\nspecial diagnostic laboratory tests costing more than $1,000, or when it is\nnecessary for a physical or occupational therapist to continue\nphysiotherapeutic or occupational therapy procedures prescribed by a treating\nprovider costing more than $1,000, and the claim is controverted or the time to\ncontrovert the claim has not expired or the body part or condition has not been\nestablished, the treating provider shall submit a PAR to the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator who would become responsible\nin the event the claim is adjudicated compensable by following the procedures\nin subdivision (a) of this section. All such procedures are applicable to such\nrequests. (2)\n\nThe authorization\nherein referred to, if granted by the insurance carrier, self-insured employer\nor third-party administrator, is limited to the question only of medical\nnecessity of the services requested, and such authorization shall not be\nconstrued as an admission that the condition for which these services are\nrequired is compensable. (3)\n\nWhen\nthe Chair issues an order, pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) of this section in a\ncontroverted case, the carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator shall not be responsible for the payment of such services until\nthe question of compensability is resolved and then only if the claim is\nestablished as compensable. (c) Multiple special services. If a treating\nprovider provides medical treatment or special services to more than one body\npart or more than one medical treatment or special service to the same body\npart, such treatment or special services shall be considered separate and shall\nnot require a PAR pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law section 13-a (5) or\nthis section if the medical treatments or special services individually costs\nless than $1,000. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the medical\ntreatment or special services are a series of related treatment or care, such\nas physical or occupational therapy, or part of a battery of related tests, such as electrodiagnostic tests, the aggregate amount of such treatment, care, or tests shall be considered as a single request and shall require a PAR\npursuant to Workers' Compensation Law section 13-a (5) or this section if the\naggregate amount is more than $1,000.
