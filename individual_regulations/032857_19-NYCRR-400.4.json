Notice of hearing and statement of charges (or complaint) shall\nbe communicated in any manner permitted by the applicable regulatory statute or\nthe Civil Practice Law and Rules. Respondent may, at his option, serve an\nanswer denying such charges and interposing affirmative defenses, if any. Absent an answer, all charges are deemed denied and all rights are\nreserved. (b) The Department of\n\nState shall, before making a final determination to deny an application for a\nlicense, notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for such proposed\ndenial and shall afford the applicant an opportunity to be heard in person or\nby counsel prior to denial of the application. Such notification shall be\nserved personally or by certified mail or in any manner authorized by the Civil\n\nPractice Law and Rules. If the applicant is a real estate salesman or has\napplied to become a salesman, the department shall also notify the broker with\nwhom such salesman is associated, or with whom such salesman or applicant is\nabout to become associated, of such proposed denial. If a hearing is requested, such hearing shall be held at such time and place as the department shall\nprescribe. If the applicant fails to make a written request for a hearing\nwithin 35 days after receipt of such notification, then the notification of\ndenial shall become the final determination of the department. Upon receipt of\nsuch demand, an adjudicatory proceeding will be commenced in the manner set\nforth in subdivision (a) of this section, except that the reasons for denial\nwill be set forth in the stead of charges.
