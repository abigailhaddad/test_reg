The request for division's approval of the higher allowance will\ninclude a certified copy of the municipality's ordinance, rule or regulation\nestablishing or amending its allowance limitations. (b) Employees or agents\n(\ni.e., lawyers, architects, etc.) paid by an authority will be\nallowed a per diem of $32 (exclusive of common carrier transportation costs), except that such amount shall be $37 outside New York State, and except further\nthat such amount shall be $38 when on travel status within New York City and\n\nNassau, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester counties. However, these limits may\nbe increased as outlined in subdivision (a) of this section, if local\nmunicipality has established higher allowances for its employees or\nagents. (c) Any\nper\ndiem\nallowance established in subdivision (a) or (b) of this section\nwill be reduced to $29 in the New York City area and $23 elsewhere in New York\n\nState when lodging accommodations are taken in apartments, rooming houses, tourist homes and private residences, other than homes of members of traveler's\nfamily. If lodging accommodations are taken in the homes of members or\nrelatives of traveler's family, only the meal rates shown under subdivision (f)\nof this section will be allowed. (d) A day consists of three meals and lodging\ncommencing with the first subsistence expense incurred after leaving the\nofficial station, which is generally the municipality in which the authority is\nlocated. (e) The\nper\ndiem\nallowance includes incidentals (such as tips) in connection with\nlodging or meals. Other incidental expenses, such as local bus fares, official\ntelephone calls, etc. are reimbursable to the extent of the expense. Taxi fares\nare reimbursable only in the absence of public transportation or are otherwise\njustified. Charges for travel between transportation terminals and residence, lodging or place visited are reimbursable to the extent of the expense up to a\nmaximum of $3 for one way. (f) The\nfollowing meal rates will be used when travel does not involve an overnight\nstay or traveler stays at home of family members. They will also be used to\ndetermine the amount of deduction from the\nper diem\nallowance\nfor any meals not reimbursable because of less than a full day travel status\n(usually at the end of a trip), inclusion of meals in a conference registration\nfee, or any other reason. Description\n\nAmount Allowed\n\nNew York City Area\n\nElsewhere in New\n\nYork State\n\nBreakfast\n$3.00\n$3.00\n\nLunch\n$1.65\n$1.65\n\nDinner\n$9.35\n$8.35\n(g) Claims for meals will be allowed only\nwhen traveler departs from his official station or place of residence before, or returns to his official station or place of residence after, the following\nhours: Depart\nbefore\n\nReturn\nafter\n\nBreakfast\n7:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m. Lunch\n11:30 a.m. 2:00 p.m. Dinner\n6:00 p.m. 7:00 p.m. (h) The standard travel voucher (division's\nform #HM-35) must be prepared and approved in all cases. Details of expenses\nare not required when claiming a\nper diem\nallowance except\nthat original lodging receipts are required as evidence of overnight stays. Claims for reimbursement for travel of more than one day may be combined, e.g., four days at $24 for a total of $96. Entries of time of departure and time of\nreturn on the standard travel voucher must justify any claim for full or\npartial\nper diem\nallowance within the time limits listed in\nsubdivision (g) of this section. (i) When a member of the staff of a housing\nauthority is required to attend evening meetings (authority meetings, tenant\ngroup meetings, etc.) after his regular working hours, a supper money allowance\nof $2.50 is authorized.
