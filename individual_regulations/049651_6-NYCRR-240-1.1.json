A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) with a planning boundary that\nincludes a nonattainment or maintenance area. (2)\n\nApplicable State implementation plan\n(SIP) revision. The portion (or portions) of the State implementation plan, or\nmost recent revision thereof, which has been approved under section 110, or\npromulgated under section 110(c), or promulgated or approved pursuant to\nregulations promulgated under section 301(d) of the act, and which implements\nthe relevant requirements of the act for the purpose of determining conformity\nof federally funded transportation plans, programs or projects to State\nimplementation plans, and meets the requirements of an implementation plan as\ndefined in section 302(q) of the act (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). (3)\n\nConsultation. The process by which\ninvolved agencies confer with each other, provide appropriate information\nneeded for meaningful input, and consider the views of other involved agencies\nprior to any final decisions made pursuant to this Part. At a minimum, consultation means substantial compliance with the requirements of Subpart\n240-2 of this Part. (4)\n\nDesign\nconcept. The type of facility identified by the project, e.g., freeway, expressway, arterial highway, grade-separated highway, reserved right-of-way\nrail transit, mixed-traffic rail transit, exclusive busway, etc. (5)\n\nDesign scope. The design aspects which\nwill affect the proposed facility's impact on regional emissions, usually as\nthey relate to vehicle or person carrying capacity and control, e.g., number of\nlanes or tracks to be constructed or added, length of project, signalization, access control including approximate number and location of interchanges, preferential treatment for high-occupancy vehicles, etc. (6)\n\nFacility. That which is built, installed, established or operated to serve a transportation purpose. (7)\nFHWA. The Federal Highway Administration\nof USDOT. (8)\nFHWA/FTA project.

(9)\nFTA. The Federal Transit Administration\nof USDOT. (10)\n\nGovernor. The\n\nGovernor of the State of New York, or the Governor's designee. (11)\n\nHighway project. An undertaking to\nimplement or modify a highway facility or highway-related program. Such an\nundertaking consists of all required phases necessary for implementation. For\nanalytical purposes, it must be defined sufficiently to: (i) connect logical termini and be of\nsufficient length to address environmental matters on a broad scope; (ii)\nhave independent utility or\nsignificance, i.e., be usable and be a reasonable expenditure even if no\nadditional transportation improvements in the area are made; and\n(iii)\nnot restrict consideration of\nalternatives for other reasonably foreseeable transportation\nimprovements. (12)\n\nHot-spot analysis. An estimation of likely future localized CO, PM\n10, and/or PM\n2.5\npollutant\nconcentrations and a comparison of those concentrations to the national ambient\nair quality standards (NAAQS). Hot-spot analysis assesses impacts on a scale\nsmaller than the entire nonattainment or maintenance area, including, for\nexample, congested roadway intersections and highways or transit terminals, and\nuses an air quality dispersion model to determine the effects of emissions on\nair quality. (13)\n\nInvolved\nagencies. The department, NYSDOT, EPA, FHWA, FTA, affected MPOs, affected\ncounties in nonattainment or maintenance areas outside MPO planning boundaries, affected local air agencies, and any other agencies responsible for project\nlevel conformity.
