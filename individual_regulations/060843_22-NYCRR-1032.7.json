  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1032.7 - Compensation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\nattorney for children seeking compensation for services rendered pursuant to\n\nFamily Court Act, section 245 shall submit a claim for approval to the Family\n\nCourt on forms authorized by the Chief Administrator of the Courts. The Family\n\nCourt shall certify the claim, subject to appropriate modifications, and shall\nforward the claim to the Appellate Division for approval and certification to\nthe Comptroller for payment. When a claim is received by the Appellate Division\nmore than 90 days after the attorney for children has completed the assignment, the attorney for children shall provide an affidavit stating that the attorney\nfor children has not been paid for the services rendered, that a claim has not\nbeen submitted previously, and the reasons why the claim was not received\nwithin the 90-day period. The Appellate Division may, in the exercise of its\ndiscretion, disapprove any claim not received with the 90-day period. (b) Compensation in excess of the limits\nestablished by Family Court Act, section 245 and Judiciary Law section 35 shall\nnot be approved absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances. An attorney\nfor children submitting a claim for compensation in excess of the statutory\nlimits shall submit, with the claim, an affidavit detailing the nature of the\nproceeding in which the services were rendered, the services rendered, the time\nexpended, the expenses incurred and the facts that would support a finding of\nextraordinary circumstances. Absent such an affidavit, a fee in excess of the\nstatutory limits shall not be approved. (c) In determining whether there are\nextraordinary circumstances warranting compensation in excess of the statutory\nlimits, the Family Court and the Appellate Division shall consider: (1)\nwhether the matter involved unusually\ncomplex factual or legal issues; (2)\nwhether a novel issue of law, which\nrequired extensive legal research was involved; (3)\nwhether a lengthy trial or other in-court\nproceedings were necessary; and\n(4)\nany other unique or unusual circumstances. The expenditure of time alone, however, shall not\nconstitute an extraordinary circumstance. (d) When an attorney for children anticipates\nthat expenses, as authorized pursuant to Family Court Act, section 245 and\n\nJudiciary Law, section 35, will exceed $1,000, the attorney for children shall, before incurring such expenses, obtain approval of the Family Court and the\n\nAppellate Division.
