(b) Facility expansion, as defined in section\n750-1.2\nof this Part, for all\nexisting SPDES permittees that are not POTWs must be reported by submission of\na letter to the regional water engineer. The department may determine that\nadditional information must be submitted or that the information submitted by\nletter to the regional permit administrator must be submitted on a department\napplication form. The department may determine, on the basis of such\ninformation, and any related investigation, inspection or sampling, that a\nmodification of the permit is necessary to assure maintenance of water quality\nstandards or compliance with other provisions of ECL, article 17 or the Clean\n\nWater Act. Conversely, the department may determine in accordance with this\n\nPart that the proposed activity does not require a permit modification. Unless\nthe department determines that a permit modification is unnecessary, operations\nthat fit the following criteria, which may result in discharges that are not\ndischarges authorized by the SPDES permit, are prohibited until the permit has\nbeen modified in accordance with Part 621 of this Title: (1)\nincreases in production or the mass of\nany one pollutant in wastewater that occur and are expected to continue or have\noccurred and been existing for more than one year; or\n(2)\nthe permittee commences a new operation, of which no operations in this category currently exist at the facility, subject to regulation under 40 CFR\n405\nto\n471\nand/or 40 CFR part\n125\n(see\nsection\n750-1.25\nof this Part) which will\nresult in pollutants which the permittee knows or has reason to believe will be\ndischarged (except substances not required to be reported on the appropriate\nand current New York State SPDES permit application) and which is not described\nin the SPDES permit application record upon which the current permit is\nbased. (c) The permittee\nshall submit written notice to the department if the permitted facility\nexperiences a decrease in production, a decrease of process flow, or a facility\nmodification, where such change results in a greater than 20 percent decrease\nin the discharges of a pollutant explicitly limited in a SPDES permit and the\nlimit was based on production or flow, provided that such decrease in discharge\nis expected to continue or has been existing for more than one year.
