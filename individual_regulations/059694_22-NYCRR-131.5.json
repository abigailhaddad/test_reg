  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 131.5 - Mandatory pretrial conference\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where a presiding trial judge has\napproved, in whole or in part, an application for coverage of any judicial\nproceeding, the judge, before any such coverage is to begin, shall conduct a\npretrial conference for the purpose of reviewing, with counsel to all parties\nto the proceeding and with representatives of the news media who will provide\nsuch coverage, any objections to coverage that have been raised, the scope of\ncoverage to be permitted, the nature and extent of the technical equipment and\npersonnel to be deployed, and the restrictions on coverage to be observed. The\ncourt may include in the conference any other person whom it deems appropriate, including prospective witnesses and their representatives. (b) Where two or more\nrepresentatives of the news media are parties to an approved application for\ncoverage, no such coverage may begin until all such representatives have agreed\nupon a pooling arrangement for their respective news media prior to the\npretrial conference. Such pooling arrangement shall include the designation of\npool operators and replacement pool operators for the electronic and motion\npicture media and for the still photography media, as appropriate. It also\nshall include procedures for the cost-sharing and dissemination of audio-visual\nmaterial and shall make due provision for educational users' needs for full\ncoverage of entire proceedings. The presiding trial judge shall not be called\nupon to mediate or resolve any dispute as to such arrangement. Nothing herein\nshall prohibit a person or organization that was not party to an approved\napplication for coverage from making appropriate arrangements with the pool\noperator to be given access to the audio-visual material produced by the\npool. (c) In\ndetermining the scope of coverage to be permitted, the presiding trial judge\nshall be guided by a consideration of all relevant factors, including those\nprescribed in subdivision (d) of section\n131.3\nof this Part. Wherever\nnecessary or appropriate, the presiding trial judge shall, at any time before\nor during the proceeding, proscribe coverage or modify, expand, impose, or\nremove special limitations on coverage.
