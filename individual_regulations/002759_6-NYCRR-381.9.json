Tit. 6 § 381.9 - Permitting standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndepartment's decision to issue or deny a permit for the transport of low-level\nradioactive waste shall be based on the following considerations: (1)\n\nThe status of any receiving facilities\nidentified in the permit application. No permit shall be issued unless the\nreceiving facility is an authorized facility as defined in section\n381.4\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nThe compliance status of\nany receiving facility. A low-level radioactive waste transporter permit may be\ndenied, revoked, suspended or modified if the receiving facility has been\ndetermined to have violated any State or Federal law, rule or regulation or\npermit condition related to the operation of its treatment, storage or disposal\nfacility. (3)\n\nThe compliance\nhistory and reliability of the applicant. A low-level radioactive waste\ntransporter permit may be denied, revoked, suspended or modified based upon the\nunsuitability of the applicant as set forth in this section. The department\nshall not authorize the issuance to, nor holding of permits for low-level\nradioactive waste transportation by unqualified or unsuitable persons. In\naddition to any other available grounds, the commissioner may, consistent with\nthe policies of article 23-A of the Correction Law, and the provisions of\nsection 70-0115 of the ECL, deny, suspend, revoke or modify any permit, renewal\nor modification thereto for the transportation of low-level radioactive waste, after determining in writing that such action is required to protect the public\nhealth and safety. Some of the factors which the commissioner may consider in\narriving at such determination include: (i) The permit holder or applicant has been determined in an administrative, civil\nor criminal proceeding to have violated any provision of article 27 of the ECL, any related order or determination of the commissioner, any regulation\npromulgated pursuant to such article or the condition of any permit issued\nthereunder, or any similar statute, regulation, order or permit condition of\nthe Federal or any state government. (ii)\n\nThe permit holder or applicant has been\ndenied a permit for the same or substantially similar activity based upon one\nor more of the provisions of this subdivision or a similar provision of Federal\nor other state law. (iii)\n\nThe\npermit holder or applicant has been found in a civil proceeding to have\ncommitted a negligent or intentionally tortuous act, or has been convicted in a\ncriminal proceeding of a criminal act involving the handling, storing, treating, disposing or transporting of low-level radioactive waste or other\nregulated waste. (iv)\n\nThe permit\nholder or applicant has been convicted of a criminal offense, under the laws of\nany state or of the United States, which involves a violent felony offense, fraud, bribery, perjury, theft or an offense against public administration as\nthat term is used in article 195 of the Penal Law. (v) The permit holder or applicant has in any\nmatter within the jurisdiction of the department knowingly falsified or\nconcealed a material fact, knowingly submitted a false statement or made use of\nor made a false statement on or in connection with any document or application\nsubmitted to the department. (4)\n\nSuch permit holder or applicant is\neither: (i) an individual who had a\nsubstantial interest in or acted as a high managerial agent or director for any\ncorporation, partnership, association or organization which committed an act or\nfailed to act, and such act or failure to act could be the basis for the denial\nof a permit pursuant to this Part, if such corporation, partnership, association or organization applied for a permit pursuant to this\n\nPart; (ii)\na corporation, partnership, association, organization, or any principal thereof, or any person\nholding a substantial interest therein, which committed an act or failed to\nact, and such act or failure to act could be the basis for the denial of a\npermit pursuant to this Part, if such corporation, partnership, association or\norganization applied for a permit pursuant to this Part; or\n(iii)\na corporation, partnership, association\nor organization or any high managerial agent or director thereof, or any person\nholding a substantial interest therein, acting as high managerial agent or\ndirector for or holding a substantial interest in another corporation, partnership, association or organization which committed an act or failed to\nact, and such act or failure to act could be the basis for the denial of a\npermit pursuant to this Part had such other corporation, partnership, association or organization applied for a permit under this Part. For the\npurposes of this subdivision, high managerial agent has the same meaning as is\ngiven that term in section\n20.20\nof the Penal\n\nLaw. (5)\n\nAny person\ndenied a permit, renewal or modification on the grounds specified in this\nsection shall be entitled to a hearing within 60 days of such denial in the\ncase of a new permit, or within 15 days in the case of a renewal or\nmodification of an existing permit. The conduct of such hearing shall be\ngoverned by article 70 of the ECL and regulations promulgated\nthereunder. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
