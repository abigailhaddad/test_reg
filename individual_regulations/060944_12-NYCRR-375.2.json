Tit. 12 § 375.2 - Employee benefits only to be evaluated\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt is required by law that benefits payable to employees\nunder a plan shall be \"at least as favorable\" as the employee disability\nbenefits provided by law, and dependent benefits are, therefore, excess\nbenefits not evaluated under this Article.
