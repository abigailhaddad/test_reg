The manufacturer's statement must\nbe in writing, indicate an affirmative statement of compatibility, and specify\nthe range of biofuel blends with which the equipment or component is\ncompatible. (2)\n\nRecordkeeping. Records required by this subdivision must be\nmaintained until the AST system is permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision 4.5(b) of this Subpart. (d) Spill and overfill\nprevention. Facilities must be protected against releases due to\nspilling or overfilling in accordance with the following requirements: (1)\n\nTanks must have a label\n(\ne.g., stenciled lettering) at or near every fill port\nindicating the tank's registration identification number, and design and\nworking capacities. (2)\n\nFill ports\nmust be color coded in accordance with API RP 1637 (April 2020). If an AST\nsystem contains petroleum that does not have a corresponding API color code, the type of petroleum currently in the AST system must be identified\n(\ne.g., stenciled lettering) at or near the fill port. For any\nfill port connected to multiple tanks storing different types of petroleum, the\ntypes of petroleum in each of the AST systems must be identified\n(\ne.g., with a label or placard) near the fill port. If a fill\nport is remote from the tank, the type of petroleum current in the AST system\nmust also be identified (\ne.g., API color code, stenciled\nlettering) at the tank. (3)\n\nMonitoring wells must be clearly identified (\ne.g., labeled as\n\"monitoring well\", color coded in accordance with API RP 1637 (April 2020)) to\nprevent the accidental delivery of petroleum and must be sealed or capped to\nprevent liquids from entering from the surface. (4)\n\nDelivery of petroleum to an AST\nsystem. (i) The operator, when on the\npremises or when in control of the delivery, is responsible for transfer\nactivities. If the operator is not on the premises and is not in control of a\ndelivery, the carrier is responsible for transfer activities. The requirements\nof subparagraphs (ii) through (viii) of this paragraph apply to the person\nresponsible for the transfer activities. The operator or carrier must employ\npractices for preventing transfer spills, overfills, and releases. (ii)\n\nOne of the transfer procedures described\nin NFPA 385 (2012 edition) or API RP 1007 (March 2001) must be used to comply\nwith the requirements of this paragraph. In circumstances of technical\ninfeasibility, practices must be developed and employed to ensure that releases\ndue to spilling or overfilling do not occur. (iii)\n\nImmediately prior to a delivery, the\noperator/carrier must determine that the delivery will be made to the proper\ntank system, the tank has sufficient capacity to receive the volume of\npetroleum to be delivered, and all ancillary equipment are in the appropriate\nposition to accept delivery. All couplings and other connections must be\ninspected to ensure that they are leak-free, undamaged, and fully functional. During and after the delivery, all couplings and other connections must be\nmonitored for leaks. (iv)\n\nImmediately prior to a delivery, fill port catch basins must be inspected to\nensure that they are empty. No deliveries may be made to the AST system if the\nfill port catch basin contains water, petroleum, or debris. (v) Brakes must be set and wheels chocked on\nall rail cars before and during the delivery. (vi)\n\nWhen a truck, rail car, or container is\nconnected to the delivery piping, caution signs must be in place to give\nwarning to persons approaching from any potential direction. Signs must remain\nin place until operations are completed, all connections are removed, and\noutlets properly closed. (vii)\n\nDuring the delivery, the operator/carrier must always supervise, monitor, and\ncontrol the transfer to prevent overfilling and spilling. The operator/carrier\nmust be trained in the proper transfer procedures and must take immediate\naction to stop the transfer of petroleum when the tank's working capacity has\nbeen reached, or if an equipment failure or emergency occurs. (viii)\n\nImmediately after a delivery, fill\nport catch basins must be inspected to ensure that they are empty. The fill\nport catch basin may not be left containing water, petroleum, or\ndebris. (e) Periodic inspection of overfill prevention equipment. Reserved. (f) Periodic\nmonitoring/testing of fill port catch basins and containment sumps used for\ninterstitial monitoring of piping. Reserved. (g) Periodic monitoring/testing of\nleak detection equipment. Reserved. (h) Periodic operation and\nmaintenance walkthrough inspections. (1)\n\nWalkthrough inspection\npractices. Walkthrough inspections that, at a minimum, check the\nfollowing equipment at 30-day intervals, must be performed to ensure proper\noperation and maintenance of AST systems: (i) leak detection equipment/systems; (ii)\ncathodic protection\nequipment/systems; (iii)\noverfill\nprevention equipment; (iv)\nany\nother monitoring/warning equipment/system installed; (v) for AST systems with tanks that are fully\nenclosed within pre-fabricated secondary containment: (a) exterior surfaces of the tank secondary\ncontainment; (b) exterior surfaces\nof accessible portions of piping and ancillary equipment; and\n(c) the interstitial space of traditional and\nmodified double-walled tanks; (vi)\nfor AST systems with tanks that are\ninsulated in order to store heated petroleum and within secondary containment: (a) the tank insulation; and\n(b) exterior surfaces of accessible portions\nof piping and ancillary equipment; (vii)\nfor all other AST systems: (a) exterior surfaces of the tank; and\n(b) exterior surfaces of piping\nand ancillary equipment. (2)\n\nThe inspection must identify\ndeficiencies, as applicable, including leaks, cracks, areas of wear, corrosion\nand thinning, poor maintenance and operating practices, excessive settlement of\nstructures, separation or swelling of tank insulation, malfunctioning\nequipment, and structural and foundation weaknesses. (3)\n\nIf any portion of the AST system is not\ninspected as required, that AST system must be promptly taken out of service in\naccordance with subdivision 4.5(a) of this Subpart. (4)\n\nRecordkeeping. Records\nrequired by this subdivision must be retained for three years. (i) Operation and\nmaintenance of corrosion protection. Metal tank system components must\nbe protected from corrosion to prevent releases due to corrosion, until the AST\nsystem is permanently closed in accordance with subdivision 4.5(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (1)\n\nCorrosion protection systems\nmust be operated and maintained to continuously and adequately protect metal\ntank system components that are in contact with the ground and routinely\ncontain petroleum. (2)\n\nCathodic\nprotection systems must be tested for proper operation by a qualified cathodic\nprotection tester in accordance with the following requirements: (i) Frequency. Cathodic\nprotection systems are tested within six months of the cathodic protection\nsystem's installation, reinstallation, or repair, and at yearly intervals\nthereafter. (ii)\n\nInspection\ncriteria. One of the following codes of practice (refer to section\n1.10\nof this Part for complete\ncitation of references) is used to determine that cathodic protection is\nadequate: (a) API RP 651, January 2007; or\n(b) NACE RP0193-2001, 2001. (3)\n\nImpressed current systems must be inspected for proper operation every 60 days. The inspection does not need to be conducted by a qualified cathodic protection\ntester, but must indicate: (i) the current\nrectifier readings (both voltage and amperage); (ii)\nwhether the current amperage reading is\nwithin 20 percent of the baseline amperage reading from the previous annual\ncathodic protection test; (iii)\nwhether the rectifier clock, if available, has been operated\ncontinuously; (iv)\nwhether the\nbonding cable connections are secure; and\n(v) any issues found and the actions taken to\naddress them. (4)\n\nRecordkeeping. Records required by paragraphs (2) and (3) of\nthis subdivision must be retained for three years. (j) Repairs and\nmodifications. (1)\n\nIf the tank\nsystem or any component thereof is inadequate or not tight, or any inspection\nshows that continuation of an operation or practice will result in a leak, then: (i) the operation or practice must be\nmodified or discontinued immediately; (ii)\nthe tank system or tank system component\nmust be immediately replaced; or\n(iii)\nthe tank system must be immediately\nemptied and taken out of service in accordance with subdivision 4.5(a) of this\n\nSubpart before the necessary repairs and required subsequent testing are\nperformed, unless the tank system is permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision 4.5(b) of this Subpart. (Examples which may indicate that a leak is imminent\ninclude: leaking valves, pumps, and pipe joints; inadequate gauges; tightness\ntest failures; excessive thinning of the tank shell which would indicate\nstructural weakness when the tank is filled; and malfunctioning pressure or\ntemperature gauges.)\n(2)\n\nIf the tank system or any component\nthereof, or continuation of an operation or practice, is not in imminent danger\nof causing a leak, but an inspection shows that the tank system is\nmalfunctioning or is in disrepair, and that a leak is likely or probable unless\naction is taken, then: (i) the operation or\npractice must be modified or discontinued immediately; (ii)\nthe tank system or tank system component\nmust be replaced within 90 days (unless a shorter time is deemed necessary by\nthe Department); or\n(iii)\nthe tank\nsystem must be taken out of service in accordance with subdivision 4.5(a) of\nthis Subpart before the necessary repairs and required subsequent testing are\nperformed, unless the tank system is permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision 4.5(b) of this Subpart. (Examples of such equipment disrepair include: secondary\ncontainment dikes with erosion or rodent damage; deficiencies in coatings for\npreventing corrosion caused by exposure to the environment; malfunctioning leak\ndetection equipment; and cathodic protection systems which fail to provide the\nnecessary electric current to prevent corrosion.)\n(3)\n\nRepairs must be permanent, equal to or\nmore protective than the standards of original construction or manufacturer's\nspecifications, and must be accompanied by a signed statement from the person\nwho performed the repair that the repaired tank system component meets this\nrequirement. (4)\n\nRepairs to steel\ntanks must be made with steel welds or steel patches that are welded in place. Welds associated with tank repairs must be inspected and tightness tested\nwithin 30 days following the repair. (5)\n\nMetal pipe sections and fittings from\nwhich petroleum has leaked as a result of corrosion or other damage must be\nreplaced. (6)\n\nNoncorrodible pipes\nand fittings from which petroleum has leaked or that have been damaged must be\nrepaired or replaced. (7)\n\nFor a\npiping repair or replacement, a new piping run must be replaced when 50 percent\nor more of the piping run is removed, unless the piping run meets the\nrequirements of subparagraph 4.1(b)(2)(iii) of this Subpart. (8)\n\nWithin 30 days following the repair of\ntanks and piping, repaired tanks and piping must be tightness tested in\naccordance with paragraph 4.3(c)(1) and (d)(2) of this Subpart, respectively, with the exception of the following: (i) tanks\nthat are internally inspected in accordance with API Standard 653 (April 2009)\nor STI SP001 (September 2011) following the repair; and\n(ii)\n\nCategory 1 piping that is associated\nwith a field-constructed tank with a design capacity greater than 50,000\ngallons, and is tightness tested in accordance with paragraph 4.3(d)(3) of this\n\nSubpart following the repair. (9)\n\nWithin six months following the repair of\nany tank system component that is cathodically protected, or any repair or\nreinstallation of a cathodic protection system, the cathodic protection system\nmust be tested and inspected, as applicable, in accordance with paragraphs\n(i)(2) and (3) of this section to ensure proper operation. (10)\n\nRecordkeeping. (i) Records required by paragraphs (1)\nthrough (9) of this subdivision must be retained until the AST system is\npermanently closed in accordance with section 4.5(b) of this Subpart. (ii)\n\nWritten documentation of all repairs of\nleak detection equipment installed on-site must be retained for at least three\nyears after the servicing work is completed. (k) AST systems in locations subject\nto flooding. (1)\n\nFor Category 1 or 2\ntanks located in an area where the tank may become buoyant because of a rise in\nthe water table, flooding, or accumulation of water, safeguards must be\nmaintained in accordance with section 2-5.6 of NFPA 30 (1984 edition). If such\nsafeguards include ballasting of a tank with water during flood warning\nperiods, tank system valves and other openings must be closed and secured in a\nlocked position in advance of the flood. Ballast water removed from the tank\nafter the flood must not be discharged to the waters of the State unless the\ndischarge is in conformance with the standards of Parts 701, 702, 703, and 750\nof this Title, as applicable. (2)\n\nFor Category 3 tanks located in an area where the tank may become buoyant\nbecause of a rise in the water table, flooding or accumulation of water from\nfire suppression operations, uplift protection must be provided in accordance\nwith Sections 22.14 and 23.14 of NFPA 30 (2012 edition). (l) Stormwater management. Stormwater which collects within the secondary containment must be controlled\nby a manually operated pump or siphon, or a gravity drain pipe which has a\nmanually controlled dike valve on the outside of the dike. All pumps, siphons\nand valves must be properly maintained and kept in good condition. If gravity\ndrain pipes are used, all dike valves must be locked in a closed position\nexcept when the operator is in the process of draining clean water from the\ndiked area. Stormwater or any other discharge at a facility must be\nuncontaminated and free of sheen prior to discharge. Stormwater which is\ncontaminated must not be discharged to the waters of the State unless the\ndischarge is in conformance with the standards of Parts 701, 702, 703, and 750\nof this Title, as applicable.
