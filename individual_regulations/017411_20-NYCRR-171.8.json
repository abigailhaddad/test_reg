(ii)\n\nThe Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay find that a copy of a\n\nCertificate of Exemption from\n\nWithholding\n(form IT-2104E) which has been submitted contains a\nmaterially incorrect statement, or it may determine, after written request to\nthe employee for verification of the statements on the certificate, that the\ncertificate lacks sufficient information to determine if the certificate is\ncorrect. If the Department of Taxation and Finance so finds or determines, and\nnotifies the employer in writing that the certificate is defective, the\nemployer must then consider the\n\nCertificate of Exemption from\n\nWithholding\n(form IT-2104E) to be defective for purposes of computing\nthe amount of New York State personal income tax to be withheld. (iii)\n\nIf the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance notifies the employer that a\n\nCertificate of Exemption from\n\nWithholding\n(form IT-2104E) is defective, the Department of Taxation\nand Finance will, based on its findings, advise the employer that the employee\nis not entitled to claim exemption from withholding and will advise the\nemployer as to the maximum withholding exemptions the employee is entitled to\nclaim.

If\nthe new certificate does make a claim which is greater than the number\ncontained in the Department of Taxation and Finance's written notice to the\nemployer, then the employer shall disregard the new\n\nEmployee's\n\nWithholding Allowance Certificate\n(form IT-2104), shall not submit\nthat new certificate to the Department of Taxation and Finance, and shall\ncontinue to withhold amounts of New York State personal income tax from the\nemployee on the basis of the maximum number specified in the written notice\nreceived from the Department of Taxation and Finance.
