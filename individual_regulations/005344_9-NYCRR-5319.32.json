  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.32 - Multi-line games\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nindividual line in a multi-line game to be played shall be indicated clearly by\na gaming device so that the player is in no doubt as to which lines are being\nbet on. Displaying the number of lines bet shall be sufficient to meet this\nrequirement. (b) The credits bet\nper line shall be shown. It is acceptable if the bet-per-line can be calculated\nfrom the number of lines bet and the total bet. (c) The winning pay line or lines shall be\ndiscernable clearly to the player (e.g., on a video game, it may be\naccomplished by drawing a line over the symbols on the pay line or lines and/or\nthe flashing of winning symbols and line selection box). Where there are wins\non multiple lines, each winning pay line may be indicated in turn. The\nrequirements in this subdivision would not apply to electromechanical reel\ngames unless technology is used that implements pay lines similar to those used\non video displays (e.g., backlit reels flashing for each winning pay\nline). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5319.32\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
