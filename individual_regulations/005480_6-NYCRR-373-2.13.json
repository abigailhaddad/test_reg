  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.13 - Land treatment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of facilities that treat or dispose of hazardous waste in land\ntreatment units, except as section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (b) Treatment program. (1)\n\nAn owner or operator subject to this\nsection must establish a land treatment program that is designed to ensure that\nhazardous constituents placed in or on the treatment zone are degraded, transformed or immobilized within the treatment zone. The commissioner will\nspecify in the facility permit the elements of the treatment program, including: (i) the wastes that are capable of\nbeing treated at the unit, based on a demonstration under subdivision (c) of\nthis section; (ii)\ndesign measures\nand operating practices necessary to maximize the success of degradation, transformation and immobilization processes in the treatment zone in accordance\nwith paragraph (d)(1) of this section; and\n(iii)\nunsaturated zone monitoring provisions\nmeeting the requirements of subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will specify in the facility permit the hazardous constituents\nthat must be degraded, transformed or immobilized under this section. Hazardous constituents\nare constituents identified in Appendix\n23 of this Title (see 6 NYCRR Part\n371\n) that are reasonably expected to be in, or derived from, waste placed in or on the treatment zone. (3)\n\nThe commissioner will specify the\nvertical and horizontal dimensions of the treatment zone in the facility\npermit. The treatment zone is the portion of the unsaturated zone below and\nincluding the land surface in which the owner or operator intends to maintain\nthe conditions necessary for effective degradation, transformation or\nimmobilization of hazardous constituents. The maximum depth of the treatment\nzone must be: (i) no more than 1.5 meters\n(five feet) from the initial soil surface; and\n(ii)\nmore than one meter (three feet) above\nthe seasonal high-water table. (c) Treatment demonstration. (1)\n\nFor each waste that will be applied to\nthe treatment zone, the owner or operator must demonstrate, prior to\napplication of the waste, that hazardous constituents in the waste can be\ncompletely degraded, transformed or immobilized in the treatment\nzone. (2)\n\nIn making this\ndemonstration, the owner or operator may use field tests, laboratory analyses, available data or, in the case of existing units, operating data. If the owner\nor operator intends to conduct field tests or laboratory analyses in order to\nmake this demonstration, a treatment or disposal permit must be obtained under\nsection\n373-1.9\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. The commissioner will specify in this permit the testing, analytical, design and operating requirements (including the duration of the tests and\nanalyses and, in the case of field tests, the horizontal and vertical\ndimensions of the treatment zone, monitoring procedures, closure and clean-up\nactivities) necessary to meet the requirements in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nAny field test or\nlaboratory analysis conducted in order to make a demonstration under paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision must: (i) accurately\nsimulate the characteristics and operating conditions for the proposed land\ntreatment unit, including: (a) the\ncharacteristics of the waste (including the presence of Appendix 23 [see Part\n371 of this Title] constituents); (b) the climate in the area; (c) the topography of the surrounding\narea; (d) the characteristics of\nthe soil in the treatment zone (including depth); and\n(e) the operating practices to be used at the\nunit; (ii)\nbe likely to\nshow that hazardous constituents in the waste to be tested will be completely\ndegraded, transformed or immobilized in the treatment zone of the proposed land\ntreatment unit; and\n(iii)\nbe\nconducted in a manner that protects human health and the environment, considering: (a) the characteristics of the\nwaste to be tested; (b) the\noperating and monitoring measures taken during the course of the\ntest; (c) the duration of the\ntest; (d) the volume of waste used\nin the test; and\n(e) in the case of\nfield tests, the potential for migration of hazardous constituents to ground\nwater or surface water. (d) Design and operating\nrequirements. The commissioner will specify in the facility's permit\nhow the owner or operator will design, construct, operate and maintain the land\ntreatment unit in compliance with this subdivision. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator must design, construct, operate and maintain the unit to maximize the degradation, transformation and immobilization of hazardous constituents in the treatment\nzone. The owner or operator must design, construct, operate and maintain the\nunit in accord with all design and operating conditions that were used in the\ntreatment demonstration under subdivision (c) of this section. At a minimum, the commissioner will specify the following in the facility permit: (i) the rate and method of waste application\nto the treatment zone; (ii)\nmeasures to control soil pH; (iii)\nmeasures to enhance microbial or chemical reactions (\ne.g., fertilization, tilling); and\n(iv)\nmeasures to control the moisture content of the treatment zone. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must\ndesign, construct, operate and maintain the treatment zone to minimize runoff\nof hazardous constituents during the active life of the land treatment\nunit. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust design, construct, operate and maintain a run-on control system capable of\npreventing flow onto the treatment zone during peak discharge from at least a\n25-year storm. (4)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must design, construct, operate and maintain a runoff management\nsystem to collect and control at least the water volume resulting from a\n24-hour, 25-year storm. (5)\n\nCollection and holding facilities (\ne.g., tanks or basins)\nassociated with run-on and runoff control systems must be emptied or otherwise\nmanaged expeditiously after storms to maintain the design capacity of the\nsystem. (6)\n\nIf the treatment zone\ncontains particulate matter which may be subject to wind dispersal, the owner\nor operator must manage the unit to control wind dispersal. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator must inspect the\nunit weekly and after storms to detect evidence of: (i) deterioration, malfunctions, or improper\noperation of run-on and runoff control systems; and\n(ii)\nimproper functioning of wind dispersal\ncontrol measures. (e) Food-chain crops and agricultural\nland. (1)\n\nNo land treatment facility\nshall be located on agricultural soil groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Land Classification\n\nSystem as certified by the commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and\n\nMarkets). (2)\n\nNo food chain crops\nmay be grown on any facility that is or has been used as a land treatment\nfacility for hazardous wastes. (3)\n\nAny person receiving a permit to operate a land treatment facility for\nhazardous waste shall, as a condition of such permit, place or cause to be\nplaced a restrictive covenant, which shall run with the land to the deed or\ndeeds to all real property subject to the permit, which prohibits the use of\nsuch real property for the growing of food-chain crops. (f) Unsaturated zone monitoring. An owner or operator subject to this section must\nestablish an unsaturated zone monitoring program to discharge the following\nresponsibilities: (1)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must monitor the soil and soil-pore liquid to determine whether\nhazardous constituents migrate out of the treatment zone. (i) The commissioner will specify the\nhazardous constituents to be monitored in the facility permit. The hazardous\nconstituents to be monitored are those specified under paragraph (b)(2) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner may\nrequire monitoring for principal hazardous constituents (PHC's) in lieu of\nconstituents specified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. PHC's\nare hazardous constituents contained in the wastes to be\napplied at the unit that are the most difficult to treat, considering the\ncombined effects of degradation, transformation and immobilization. The\ncommissioner will establish PHC's if it is found, based on waste analyses, treatment demonstrations or other data, that effective degradation, transformation or immobilization of the PHC's will assure treatment at least\nequivalent to levels for the other hazardous constituents in the\nwastes. (2)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must install an unsaturated zone monitoring system that includes soil\nmonitoring using soil cores, and soil-pore liquid monitoring using devices such\nas lysimeters. The unsaturated zone monitoring system must consist of a\nsufficient number of sampling points at appropriate locations and depths to\nyield samples that: (i) represent the quality\nof background soil-pore liquid quality and the chemical make-up of soil that\nhas not been affected by leakage from the treatment zone; and\n(ii)\nindicate the quality of soil-pore liquid\nand the chemical make-up of the soil below the treatment zone. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator must\nestablish a background value for each hazardous constituent to be monitored\nunder paragraph (1) of this subdivision. The permit will specify the background\nvalues for each constituent or specify the procedures to be used to calculate\nthe background values. (i) Background soil\nvalues may be based on a one-time sampling at a background plot having\ncharacteristics similar to those of the treatment zone. (ii)\n\nBackground soil-pore liquid values must\nbe based on at least quarterly sampling for one year at a background plot\nhaving characteristics similar to those of the treatment zone. (iii)\n\nThe owner or operator must express all\nbackground values in a form necessary for the determination of statistically\nsignificant increases under paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nIn taking samples used in the\ndetermination of all background values, the owner or operator must use an\nunsaturated zone monitoring system that complies with subparagraph (2)(i) of\nthis subdivision. (4)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must conduct soil monitoring and soil-pore liquid monitoring\nimmediately below the treatment zone. The commissioner will specify the\nfrequency and timing of soil and soil-pore liquid monitoring in the facility\npermit after considering the frequency, timing and rate of waste application, and the soil permeability. The owner or operator must express the results of\nsoil and soil-pore liquid monitoring in a form necessary for the determination\nof statistically significant increases under paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision. (5)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must use consistent sampling and analysis procedures that are designed\nto ensure sampling results that provide a reliable indication of soil-pore\nliquid quality and the chemical make-up of the soil below the treatment zone. At a minimum, the owner or operator must implement procedures and techniques\nfor: (i) sample collection; (ii)\nsample preservation and\nshipment; (iii)\nanalytical\nprocedures; and\n(iv)\nchain of\ncustody control. (6)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must determine whether there is a statistically significant\nchange over background values for any hazardous constituent to be monitored, under paragraph (1) of this subdivision, below the treatment zone each time\nsoil monitoring is conducted under paragraph (4) of this subdivision. (i) In determining whether a statistically\nsignificant increase has occurred, the owner or operator must compare the value\nof each hazardous constituent, as determined under paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision, to the background value for that constituent according to the\nstatistical procedure specified in the facility permit. (ii)\n\nThe owner or operator must determine\nwhether there has been a statistically significant increase below the treatment\nzone within a reasonable time period after completion of sampling. The\ncommissioner will specify that time period in the facility permit after\nconsidering the complexity of the statistical test and the availability of\nlaboratory facilities to perform the analysis of soil and soil-pore liquid\nsamples. (iii)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must determine whether there is a statistically significant increase\nbelow the treatment zone using a statistical procedure that provides reasonable\nconfidence that migration from the treatment zone will be identified. The\ncommissioner will specify a statistical procedure in the facility permit that\nthe commissioner finds: (a) is appropriate\nfor the distribution of the data used to establish background values; and\n(b) provides a reasonable\nbalance between the probability of falsely identifying migration from the\ntreatment zone and the probability of failing to identify real migration from\nthe treatment zone. (7)\n\nIf the owner or operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subdivision, that there is a statistically\nsignificant increase of hazardous constituents below the treatment zone, the\nowner or operator must: (i) notify the\ncommissioner of this finding, in writing, within seven days. The notification\nmust indicate what constituents have shown statistically significant increases; and\n(ii)\nwithin 90 days, submit to\nthe commissioner an application for a permit modification to modify the\noperating practices at the facility in order to maximize the success of\ndegradation, transformation or immobilization processes in the treatment\nzone. (8)\n\nIf the owner\nor operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subdivision, that\nthere is a statistically significant increase of hazardous constituents below\nthe treatment zone, the owner or operator may demonstrate that a source other\nthan regulated units caused the increase or that the increase resulted from an\nerror in sampling, analysis or evaluation. While the owner or operator may make\na demonstration under this paragraph in addition to, or in lieu of, submitting\na permit modification application under subparagraph (7)(ii) of this\nsubdivision, the owner or operator is not relieved of the requirement to submit\na permit modification application within the time specified in subparagraph\n(7)(ii), unless the demonstration made under this paragraph successfully shows\nthat a source other than regulated units caused the increase or that the\nincrease resulted from an error in sampling, analysis or evaluation. In making\na demonstration under this paragraph, the owner or operator must: (i) notify the commissioner, in writing, within seven days of determining a statistically significant increase below the\ntreatment zone, that the owner or operator intends to make a determination\nunder this paragraph; (ii)\nwithin\n90 days, submit a report to the commissioner demonstrating that a source other\nthan the regulated units caused the increase, or that the increase resulted\nfrom error in sampling, analysis or evaluation; (iii)\nwithin 90 days, submit to the\ncommissioner an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate\nchanges to the unsaturated zone monitoring program established; and\n(iv)\ncontinue to monitor in accordance with\nthe unsaturated zone monitoring program established under this\nsubdivision. (g) Recordkeeping. The owner or operator must include hazardous waste\napplication dates and rates in the operating record required under section\n373-2.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (h) Closure\nand post-closure care. (1)\n\nDuring the\nclosure period, the owner or operator must: (i) continue all operations (including pH\ncontrol) necessary to maximize degradation, transformation or immobilization of\nhazardous constituents within the treatment zone as required under paragraph\n(d)(1) of this section, except to the extent such measures are inconsistent\nwith subparagraph (viii) of this paragraph; (ii)\ncontinue all operations in the treatment\nzone to minimize runoff of hazardous constituents as required under paragraph\n(d)(2) of this section; (iii)\nmaintain the run-on control system required under paragraph (d)(3) of this\nsection; (iv)\nmaintain the runoff\nmanagement system required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section; (v) control wind dispersal of hazardous waste\nif required under paragraph (d)(6) of this section; (vi)\ncontinue to comply with any prohibitions\nor conditions concerning growth of food-chain crops under subdivision (e) of\nthis section; (vii)\ncontinue\nunsaturated zone monitoring in compliance with subdivision (f) of this section, except that soil-pore liquid monitoring may be terminated 90 days after the\nlast application of waste to the treatment zone; and\n(viii)\nestablish a vegetative cover on the\nportion of the facility being closed at such time that the cover will not\nsubstantially impede degradation, transformation or immobilization of hazardous\nconstituents in the treatment zone. The vegetative cover must be capable of\nmaintaining growth without extensive maintenance. (2)\n\nFor the purpose of complying with section\n373-2.7\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart, when closure is completed, the owner or operator may submit to the\ncommissioner certification by an independent qualified soil scientist, in lieu\nof an independent registered professional engineer, that the facility has been\nclosed in accordance with the specifications in the approved closure\nplan. (3)\n\nDuring the post-closure\ncare period, the owner or operator must: (i) continue all operations (including pH control) necessary to enhance degradation\nand transformation and sustain immobilization of hazardous constituents in the\ntreatment zone to the extent that such measures are consistent with other\npost-closure care activities; (ii)\nmaintain a vegetative cover over closed portions of the facility; (iii)\nmaintain the run-on control system\nrequired under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; (iv)\nmaintain the runoff management system\nrequired under paragraph (d)(4) of this section; (v) control wind dispersal of hazardous waste\nif required under paragraph (d)(6) of this section; (vi)\ncontinue to comply with any prohibitions\nor conditions concerning growth of food-chain crops under subdivision (e) of\nthis section; and\n(vii)\ncontinue\nunsaturated zone monitoring in compliance with subdivision (f) of this section, except that soil-pore liquid monitoring may be terminated 90 days after the\nlast application of waste to the treatment zone. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator is not subject to\nregulation under subparagraph (1)(viii) and paragraph (3) of this subdivision\nif the commissioner finds that the level of hazardous constituents in the\ntreatment zone soil does not exceed the background value of those constituents\nby an amount that is statistically significant when using the test specified in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. The owner or operator may submit such a\ndemonstration to the commissioner at any time during the closure or\npost-closure care periods. For the purposes of this paragraph: (i) The owner or operator must establish\nbackground soil values and determine whether there is a statistically\nsignificant increase over those values for all hazardous constituents specified\nin the facility permit under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (a) Background soil values may be based on a\none-time sampling of a background plot having characteristics similar to those\nof the treatment zone. (b) The\nowner or operator must express background values and values for hazardous\nconstituents in the treatment zone in a form necessary for the determination of\nstatistically significant increases under subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nIn taking\nsamples used in the determination of background and treatment zone values, the\nowner or operator must take samples at a sufficient number of sampling points\nand at appropriate locations and depths to yield samples that represent the\nchemical make-up of soil that has not been affected by leakage from the\ntreatment zone and the soil within the treatment zone, respectively. (iii)\n\nIn determining whether a statistically\nsignificant increase has occurred, the owner or operator must compare the value\nof each constituent in the treatment zone to the background value for that\nconstituent using a statistical procedure that provides reasonable confidence\nthat constituent presence in the treatment zone will be identified. The owner\nor operator must use a statistical procedure that: (a) is appropriate for the distribution of\nthe data used to establish background values; and\n(b) provides a reasonable balance between the\nprobability of falsely identifying hazardous constituent presence in the\ntreatment zone and the probability of failing to identify real presence in the\ntreatment zone. (5)\n\nThe owner or operator is not subject to\nregulation under section\n373-2.6\nof this Subpart if the\ncommissioner finds that the owner or operator satisfies paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision and if unsaturated zone monitoring under subdivision (f) of this\nsection indicates that hazardous constituents have not migrated beyond the\ntreatment zone during the active life of the land treatment\nunit. (i) Special\nrequirements for ignitable or reactive waste. The owner or operator must not apply ignitable or\nreactive waste to the treatment zone, unless the waste and the treatment zone\nmeet all applicable requirements of Part 376 of this Title and: (1)\nthe waste is immediately incorporated\ninto the soil so that: (i) the resulting\nwaste, mixture or dissolution of material no longer meets the definition of\nignitable or reactive waste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(ii)\nsection\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with; or\n(2)\nthe waste is managed in such a way that\nit is protected from any material or conditions which may cause it to ignite or\nreact. (j) Special\nrequirements for incompatible wastes. The owner or operator must not place incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials (see Appendix 29 of this Title for\nexamples), in or on the same treatment zone, unless section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (k) Special requirements for hazardous\nwastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and F027. (1)\n\nHazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and F027 must not be placed in a land treatment unit unless the owner or\noperator operates the facility in accordance with a management plan for these\nwastes that is approved by the commissioner pursuant to the standards set out\nin this paragraph, and in accord with all other applicable requirements of this\n\nSubpart. The factors to be considered are: (i) the volume and the physical and chemical characteristics of the wastes, including their potential to migrate through soil or to volatilize or escape\ninto the atmosphere; (ii)\nthe\nattenuative properties of underlying and surrounding soils or other\nmaterials; (iii)\nthe mobilizing\nproperties of other materials codisposed with these wastes; and\n(iv)\nthe effectiveness of additional\ntreatment, design or monitoring techniques. (2)\n\nThe commissioner may determine that\nadditional design, operating and monitoring requirements are necessary for land\ntreatment facilities managing hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and\nF027 to reduce the possibility of migration of these wastes to ground water, surface water or air to protect human health and the environment.
