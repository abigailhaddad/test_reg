Azo products include azo, monoazo, diazo, triazo, polyazo, azoic, benzidine, and pyrazolone products. Triarylmethane products include both\ntriarylmethane and triaphenylmethane products. Wastes that are not generated at\na dyes and/or pigments manufacturing site, such as wastes from the offsite use, formulation, and packaging of dyes and/or pigments, are not included in the\nK181 listing. (3)\nK181\nlisting levels. Nonwastewaters containing constituents in amounts equal to or\nexceeding the following levels during any calendar year are subject to the K181\nlisting, unless the conditions in the K181 listing are met. Constituent\n\nChemical abstracts No. Mass levels (kg/yr)\n\nAniline\n62-53-3\n9,300\no-Anisidine\n90-04-0\n110\n4-Chloroaniline\n106-47-8\n4,800\np-Cresidine\n120-71-8\n660\n2,4-Dimethylaniline\n95-68-1\n100\n1,2-Phenylenediamine\n95-54-5\n710\n1,3-Phenylenediamine\n108-45-2\n1,200\n(4)\n\nProcedures for demonstrating that dyes and/or pigment nonwastewaters are not\nK181. The procedures described in subparagraphs (4)(i) through (4)(iii) and\n(4)(v) of this subdivision establish when nonwastewaters from the production of\ndyes/pigments would not be hazardous (these procedures apply to wastes that are\nnot disposed in landfill units or treated in combustion units as specified in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision). If the nonwastewaters are disposed in\nlandfill units or treated in combustion units as described in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, then the nonwastewaters are not hazardous. In order to\ndemonstrate that it is meeting the landfill disposal or combustion conditions\ncontained in the K181 listing description, the generator must maintain\ndocumentation as described in subparagraph (4)(iv) of this subdivision. (i) Determination based on no K181\nconstituents. Generators that have knowledge (\ne.g., knowledge\nof constituents in wastes based on prior sampling and analysis data and/or\ninformation about raw materials used, production processes used, and reaction\nand degradation products formed) that their wastes contain none of the K181\nconstituents (see paragraph [3] of this subdivision) can use their knowledge to\ndetermine that their waste is not K181. The generator must document the basis\nfor all such determinations on an annual basis and keep each annual\ndocumentation for three years. (ii)\n\nDetermination for generated quantities of 1,000 MT/yr or less for wastes that\ncontain K181 constituents. If the total annual quantity of dyes and/or pigment\nnonwastewaters generated is 1,000 metric tons or less, the generator can use\nknowledge of the wastes (\ne.g., knowledge of constituents in\nwastes based on prior analytical data and/or information about raw materials\nused, production processes used, and reaction and degradation products formed)\nto conclude that annual mass loadings for the K181 constituents are below the\nlisting levels of paragraph (3) of this subdivision. To make this\ndetermination, the generator must: (a) Each\nyear document the basis for determining that the annual quantity of\nnonwastewaters expected to be generated will be less than 1,000 metric\ntons. (b) Track the actual quantity\nof nonwastewaters generated from January 1 through December 31 of each year. If, at any time within the year, the actual waste quantity exceeds 1,000 metric\ntons, the generator must comply with the requirements of subparagraph (4)(iii)\nof this subdivision for the remainder of the year. (c) Keep a running total of the K181\nconstituent mass loadings over the course of the calendar year. (d) Keep the following records on site for\nthe three most recent calendar years in which the hazardous waste\ndeterminations are made: (1)\n\nThe quantity of\ndyes and/or pigment nonwastewaters generated. (2)\n\nThe relevant process information\nused. (3)\n\nThe calculations\nperformed to determine annual total mass loadings for each K181 constituent in\nthe nonwastewaters during the year. (iii)\n\nDetermination for generated quantities\ngreater than 1,000 MT/yr for wastes that contain K181 constituents. If the\ntotal annual quantity of dyes and/or pigment nonwastewaters generated is\ngreater than 1,000 metric tons, the generator must perform all of the steps\ndescribed in clauses ([\na\nthrough [\nk\n) of this\nsubparagraph) in order to make a determination that its waste is not K181. (a) Determine which K181 constituents (see\nparagraph [3] of this subdivision) are reasonably expected to be present in the\nwastes based on knowledge of the wastes (\ne.g., based on prior\nsampling and analysis data and/or information about raw materials used, production processes used, and reaction and degradation products\nformed). (b) If\n1,2-phenylenediamine is present in the wastes, the generator can use either\nknowledge or sampling and analysis procedures to determine the level of this\nconstituent in the wastes. For determinations based on use of knowledge, the\ngenerator must comply with the procedures for using knowledge described in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph and keep the records described in clause\n(ii)(\nd\n) of this paragraph. For determinations based on\nsampling and analysis, the generator must comply with the sampling and analysis\nand recordkeeping requirements described below in this subdivision. (c) Develop a waste sampling and analysis\nplan (or modify an existing plan) to collect and analyze representative waste\nsamples for K181 constituents reasonably expected to be present in the wastes. At a minimum, the plan must include: (1)\na\ndiscussion of the number of samples needed to characterize the wastes\nfully; (2)\nthe planned sample\ncollection method to obtain representative waste samples; (3)\na discussion of how the sampling plan\naccounts for potential temporal and spatial variability of the\nwastes; (4)\na detailed description\nof the test methods to be used, including sample preparation, clean up (if\nnecessary), and determinative methods. (d) Collect and analyze samples in accordance\nwith the waste sampling and analysis plan. (1)\n\nThe sampling and analysis must be unbiased, precise, and representative of the\nwastes. (2)\n\nThe analytical\nmeasurements must be sufficiently sensitive, accurate and precise to support\nany claim that the constituent mass loadings are below the listing levels of\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. (e) Record the analytical results. (f) Record the waste quantity represented by\nthe sampling and analysis results. (g) Calculate constituent-specific mass\nloadings (product of concentrations and waste quantity). (h) Keep a running total of the K181\nconstituent mass loadings over the course of the calendar year. (i) Determine whether the mass of any of the\nK181 constituents listed in paragraph (3) of this subdivision generated between\n\nJanuary 1 and December 31 of any year is below the K181 listing\nlevels. (j) Keep the following\nrecords on site for the three most recent calendar years in which the hazardous\nwaste determinations are made: (1)\n\nThe\nsampling and analysis plan.The calculations performed to determine annual mass\nloadings. (2)\n\nThe sampling and\nanalysis results (including QA/QC data). (3)\n\nThe quantity of dyes and/or pigment\nnonwastewaters generated. (4)\n\nThe\ncalculations performed to determine annual mass loadings. (k) Nonhazardous waste determinations must be\nconducted annually to verify that the wastes remain nonhazardous. (1)\n\nThe annual testing requirements are\nsuspended after three consecutive successful annual demonstrations that the\nwastes are nonhazardous. The generator can then use knowledge of the wastes to\nsupport subsequent annual determinations. (2)\n\nThe annual testing requirements are\nreinstated if the manufacturing or waste treatment processes generating the\nwastes are significantly altered, resulting in an increase of the potential for\nthe wastes to exceed the listing levels. (3)\n\nIf the annual testing requirements are\nsuspended, the generator must keep records of the process knowledge information\nused to support a nonhazardous determination. If testing is reinstated, a\ndescription of the process change must be retained. (iv)\n\nRecordkeeping for the\nlandfill disposal and combustion exemptions. For the purposes of meeting the\nlandfill disposal and combustion condition set out in the K181 listing\ndescription, the generator must maintain on site for three years documentation\ndemonstrating that each shipment of waste was received by a landfill unit that\nis subject to or meets the landfill design standards set out in the listing\ndescription, or was treated in combustion units as specified in the listing\ndescription. (v) Waste holding and\nhandling. During the interim period, from the point of generation to completion\nof the hazardous waste determination, the generator is responsible for storing\nthe wastes appropriately. If the wastes are determined to be hazardous and the\ngenerator has not complied with the requirements of Parts 370 through 374-4 and\n\nPart 376 of this Title during the interim period, the generator is in violation\nand could be subject to an enforcement action for improper\nmanagement. (d) Discarded commercial chemical\nproducts, off-specification species, container residues, and spill residues\nthereof. The following materials or items are hazardous wastes if and\nwhen they are discarded or intended to be discarded as described in section\n371.1\n(c)(2)(i)\nof\nthis Part, when they are mixed with waste oil or used oil or other material and\napplied to the land for dust suppression or road treatment, when they are\notherwise applied to the land in lieu of their original intended use or when\nthey are contained in products that are applied to the land in lieu of their\noriginal intended use, or when, in lieu of their original intended use, they\nare produced for use as (or as a component of) a fuel, distributed for use as a\nfuel, or burned as a fuel: (1)\nany commercial\nchemical product, or manufacturing chemical intermediate having the generic\nname listed in paragraph (5) or (6) of this subdivision; (2)\nany off-specification commercial chemical\nproduct or manufacturing chemical intermediate which, if it met specifications, would have the generic name listed in paragraph (5) or (6) of this\nsubdivision; (3)\nany residue\nremaining in a container or inner liner removed from a container that has been\nused to hold any commercial chemical product or manufacturing chemical\nintermediate having the generic names listed in paragraph (5) or (6) of this\nsubdivision, or any residue remaining in a container or inner liner removed\nfrom a container that has been used to hold any off-specification chemical\nproduct or manufacturing chemical intermediate, which if it met specifications, would have the generic name listed in paragraph (5) or (6) of this subdivision, unless the container is empty as defined in section\n371.1\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Part. Note: Unless the residue is being beneficially used or reused, or\nlegitimately recycled or reclaimed, or being accumulated, stored, transported\nor treated prior to such use, reuse, recycling or reclamation, EPA and the\ndepartment consider the residue to be intended for discard, and thus, a\nhazardous waste. An example of a legitimate reuse of the residue would be where\nthe residue remains in the container and the container is used to hold the same\ncommercial chemical product or manufacturing chemical intermediate it\npreviously held. An example of the discard of the residue would be where the\ndrum is sent to a drum reconditioner who reconditions the drum but discards the\nresidues. All waste resulting from the rinsing or cleansing of the container or\ninner liner, by a nonaqueous solvent, is a hazardous waste. All waste resulting\nfrom the aqueous rinsing or cleansing of the container or inner liner is a\nhazardous waste unless exempt pursuant to section\n371.1\n(d)(1)(ii)\n(\nd\n)(\n4\n). (4)\nany residue or contaminated soil, water\nor other debris resulting from the cleanup of a spill into or on any land or\nwater of any commercial chemical product or manufacturing chemical intermediate\nhaving the generic name listed in paragraph (5) or (6) of this subdivision, or\nany residue or contaminated soil, water or other debris resulting from the\ncleanup of a spill, into or on any land or water, of any off-specification\nchemical product or manufacturing chemical intermediate which, if it met\nspecifications, would have the generic name listed in paragraph (5) or (6) of\nthis subdivision. Note: The phrase \"commercial chemical product or manufacturing\nchemical intermediate having the generic name listed in...\" refers to a\nchemical substance which is manufactured or formulated for commercial or\nmanufacturing use which consists of the commercially pure grade of the\nchemical, any technical grades of the chemical that are produced or marketed, and all formulations in which the chemical is the sole active ingredient. It\ndoes not refer to a material, such as a manufacturing process waste, that\ncontains any of the substances listed in paragraph (5) or (6). Where a\nmanufacturing process waste is deemed to be a hazardous waste because it\ncontains a substance listed in paragraph (5) or (6), such waste will be listed\nin either subdivision (b) or (c) of this section, or will be identified as a\nhazardous waste by the characteristics set forth in section\n371.3\nof this\n\nPart. (5)\n\nAcute hazardous\nwaste. The commercial chemical products, manufacturing chemical intermediates\nor off-specification commercial chemical products or manufacturing chemical\nintermediates referred to in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subdivision, are identified as acute hazardous wastes (H) and are subject to the small\nquantity exclusion defined in section\n371.1\n(f)(5)\nof\nthis Part. Note: For the convenience of the regulated community the primary\nhazardous properties of the materials have been indicated by the letters T\n[Toxicity], and R [Reactivity]. Absence of a letter indicates that the compound\nonly is listed for acute toxicity.

(e) Wastes containing polychlorinated\nbiphenyls (PCBs). (1)\n\nAll solid wastes\ncontaining 50 parts per million (ppm) by weight (on a dry weight basis for\nother than liquid wastes) or greater of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are\nlisted hazardous wastes, excluding small capacitors as defined in paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision and PCB articles drained in accordance with subparagraphs\n(2)(ii) and (iii) of this subdivision. PCB articles that contain less than 50\nppm PCBs are not regulated as hazardous waste. Oils in or from electrical\nequipment whose PCB concentration is unknown, except circuit breakers, reclosers and cable, must be assumed to contain between 50 and 500 ppm PCB and\nare listed hazardous waste. PCB and PCBs mean any chemical substance that is\nlimited to the biphenyl molecule that has been chlorinated to varying degrees. Any chemical waste, combination of waste, or environmental media that contains\nless than 50 ppm PCBs are listed hazardous waste only as specifically provided\nin paragraph (2) of this subdivision. Wastes that may contain PCBs include\ndielectric fluids, contaminated solvents, waste oil, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, dredge spoils, and material contaminated as a result of\nspills. The hazardous code for these PCB wastes shall be toxic waste (T). Environmental media means naturally occurring, non-living substances, including\nsoil, sediment, rock, groundwater, surface water, surface runoff, air, and only\nsuch animal and vegetable matters as may be incidentally contained therein\n(\ne.g., soil and water bacteria, underground roots, skeletal\nremains, etc.). These wastes shall have hazardous waste numbers assigned as\nfollows: DEC\nWaste\nhazardous\nwaste number\nB001\nPCB oil (concentrated) from transformers, capacitors, etc. B002\n\nPetroleum oil or other liquid containing 50 ppm or\ngreater of PCBs, but less than 500 ppm PCBs. This includes oil from electrical\nequipment whose PCB concentration is unknown, except for circuit breakers, reclosers, rectifiers and cable. B003\n\nPetroleum oil or other liquid containing 500 ppm or\ngreater of PCBs. B004\nPCB articles containing 50 ppm or greater of PCBs, but less than 500 ppm PCBs, excluding small capacitors. This includes\noil-filled electrical equipment whose PCB concentration is unknown, except for\ncircuit breakers, reclosers, rectifiers and cable. B005\nPCB articles, other than transformers, that contain\n500 ppm or greater of PCBs, excluding small capacitors. B006\nPCB transformers. PCB transformers\nmeans any transformer that contains 500 ppm PCB or greater. B007\n\nOther PCB wastes, including contaminated soil, solids, sludges, clothing, rags and dredge material. Note: PCBs are also\nregulated by 40 CFR part\n761. A person must comply with both this Part and 40\nCFR part\n761\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\not this\n\nTitle). (2)\n\nDrained PCB articles. (i) Except as provided\nin subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, drained PCB articles\ncontaining at least 50 ppm PCBs are regulated as hazardous waste. (ii)\nPCB articles, except capacitors, that\ncontain between 50 and 500 ppm PCB, are no longer regulated as PCB listed\nhazardous waste provided that all free-flowing liquid has been drained from the\narticle. The drained liquid is a listed hazardous waste, as is any solvent used\nfor flushing. (iii)\n(a) Hydraulic machines containing less than\n1,000 ppm PCB are no longer regulated as PCB listed hazardous waste, provided\nthat all free-flowing liquid has been drained from the hydraulic machine. The\ndrained liquid is a liquid hazardous waste, as is any solvent used for\nflushing. (b) Hydraulic machines\ncontaining 1,000 ppm PCB are no longer regulated as PCB listed hazardous waste, provided that all free-flowing liquid has been drained from the hydraulic\nmachine, and the drained hydraulic machine is flushed with a solvent in which\nPCBs are readily soluble. The solvent to be used for flushing must contain less\nthan 50 ppm PCB. The drained liquid and the solvent used for flushing are\nlisted hazardous wastes. (3)\n\nDefinitions. (i) PCB article\nmeans any\nmanufactured article, other than a PCB container, that contains PCBs and whose\nsurface(s) has been in direct contact with PCBs. PCB article\nincludes capacitors, transformers, electric motors, circuit breakers, reclosers, rectifiers, voltage regulators, switches (including sectionalizers\nand motor starters), electromagnets, cable, hydraulic machines, pumps, pipes, and any other manufactured item which is formed to a specific shape or design\nduring manufacture, has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon\nits shape or design during end use, and has either no change of chemical\ncomposition during its end use or only those changes of composition which have\nno commercial purpose separate from that of the PCB article. (ii)\n\nSmall capacitor\nmeans a\ncapacitor which contains less than 1.36 kg (3 lb.) of dielectric fluid. The\nfollowing assumptions may be used if the actual weight of the dielectric fluid\nis unknown. A capacitor whose total volume is less than 1,639 cubic centimeters\n(100 cubic inches) may be considered to contain less than 1.36 kg (3 lb.) of\ndielectric fluid and a capacitor whose total volume is more than 3,278 cubic\ncentimeters (200 cubic inches) must be considered to contain more than 1.36 kg\n(3 lb.) of dielectric fluid. A capacitor whose volume is between 1,639 and\n3,278 cubic centimeters may be considered to contain less than 1.36 (3 lb.) of\ndielectric fluid if the total weight of the capacitor is less than 4.08 kg (9\nlb.). (4)\n\nTesting\nprocedures. The procedures in\n40 CFR\n761.60(g)\n(see section\n370.1[e] of this Title) will be used to determine the concentration of PCBs, unless a petition for equivalent testing or analytical methods is submitted and\napproved per section\n370.3\nof this Title. (f) Deletion of certain\nhazardous waste codes following equipment cleaning and replacement. (1)\n\nWastes from wood preserving processes at\nplants that do not resume or initiate use of chlorophenolic preservatives will\nnot meet the listing definition of F032 once the generator has met all of the\nrequirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision. These wastes may, however, continue to meet another hazardous waste listing description or may\nexhibit one or more of the hazardous waste characteristics. (2)\n\nGenerators must either clean or replace\nall process equipment that may have come into contact with chlorophenolic\nformulations or constituents thereof, including, but not limited to, treatment\ncylinders, sumps, tanks, piping systems, drip pads, fork lifts, and trams, in a\nmanner that minimizes or eliminates the escape of hazardous waste or\nconstituents, leachate, contaminated drippage, or hazardous waste decomposition\nproducts to the ground water, surface water, or atmosphere. (i) Generators shall do one of the following: (a) prepare and follow an equipment\nreplacement plan and clean equipment in accordance with this\nsubdivision; (b) prepare and follow\nan equipment replacement plan and replace equipment in accordance with this\nsubdivision; or\n(c) document\ncleaning and replacement in accordance with this subdivision, carried out after\ntermination of use of chlorophenolic preservations.
