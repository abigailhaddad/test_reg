  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1220.3 - Procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When the disciplinary office determines that a complaint is appropriate for\nmediation, it shall forward copies of the complaint and any other\ncorrespondence related to the complaint, to the appropriate mediator or\ncoordinator, with notification to the attorney and the complainant of the\nreferral. The mediator or coordinator then shall notify the attorney by first\nclass mail, to submit within 20 days a response to the complaint, if a response\nwas not previously submitted. This notice also shall state that, if no response\nis received within 20 days, the complaint will be returned to the disciplinary\noffice for investigation under the appropriate Appellate Division\nrules. (b) Upon\nreceipt of the attorney's response, the matter shall be assigned to or retained\nby an impartial mediator. The mediator shall schedule a mediation conference\nwithin 14-21 days after assignment of the matter, or if the matter has been\ndirectly handled by the mediator, within 14-21 days after receipt of the\nresponse. Any additional correspondence from the attorney or the complainant\nconcerning the dispute must be submitted to the mediator no later than 10 days\nprior to the mediation conference. The mediator may grant an adjournment of the\nconference for good cause, but in no event may the conference be held more than\n45 days after the response has been received or after referral to the\ncoordinator, whichever is later. The mediator may conduct the mediation by\nteleconference. If the parties have resolved their dispute by mediation, a\nwritten agreement shall be produced and signed by both parties. (c) If the coordinator or the\nmediator determines at any time during the mediation process that the matter is\nunsuitable for mediation, or that the matter involves the type of ineligible\nconduct described in section\n1220.1\nof this Part, or that the\nmediation should not proceed because the attorney or complainant is\nuncooperative, then the complaint shall be returned to the disciplinary office\nfor appropriate action.
