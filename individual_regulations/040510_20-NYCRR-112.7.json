  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 112.7 - Optional modifications for depreciation\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 612(g)\n(a) General. (1)\n\nFor taxable years beginning on or after\n\nJanuary 1, 1964, a taxpayer is provided an option to subtract from Federal\nadjusted gross income an amount not to exceed twice the amount of Federal\ndepreciation on certain newly acquired depreciable property (optional\ndepreciation). See section\n112.3\n(k) of this section for the applicable subtraction modification. (2)\n\nProperty which qualifies for the\nmodification with respect to optional depreciation is described in section\n612 (g)(3) and (4)\nof the\n\nTax Law. This modification is allowed only upon condition that any depreciation\nor amortization allowed with respect to the same property in determining\n\nFederal adjusted gross income for a taxable year is added to Federal adjusted\ngross income (see section\n112.2\n[f]\nof this Part) for such taxable year. The total of all modifications under this\nsection in any taxable year or years with respect to any property described in\nsection\n612 (g)(3)\nof the Tax Law\nmust not exceed its cost or other basis and, with respect to property described\nin section\n612 (g)(4)\nof the Tax Law\nwhich is used in a business carried on both within and without New York State, must not exceed its cost or other basis multiplied by a percentage of the\nexcess of the taxpayer's business income over its business deductions which is\nallocated to New York State for the first year such modification is made. Such\npercentage shall be determined in accordance with the rules provided in section\n132.15\nof this Title. (b) Adjustment of basis upon sale or other disposition. (1)\n\nIn any taxable year when property, with\nrespect to which an optional modification for depreciation has been allowed, is\nsold or otherwise disposed of, the basis of such property must be adjusted to\nreflect such modification and, if the basis as so adjusted is lower than the\nadjusted basis of the same property for Federal income tax purposes, there must\nbe added to the taxpayer's Federal adjusted gross income the amount of the\ndifference between such adjusted bases (see section\n112.2\n[f]\nof this Part). For purposes of this subdivision, the New York State basis of\nproperty is the Federal original cost or other basis less the aggregate of the\namounts allowed as optional depreciation of qualifying for all taxable years\nfrom the year of acquisition to and including the year of sale or other\ndisposition. (2)\nA sale or\ndisposition of qualifying property includes any transfer or exchange without\nregard to whether gain or loss from the transaction is recognized for Federal\nincome taxes purposes. (c) Carryover of unused\nmodifications. If the optional modification for depreciation allowable\nfor any taxable year exceeds the taxpayer's New York adjusted gross income, determined without the allowance of such modification, the excess may be\ncarried over to the following taxable year or years, and may be subtracted from\nsuch taxpayer's Federal adjusted gross income (see section\n112.3\n[k]\nof this Part) for such year or years. Where a carryover under this provision is\nclaimed, complete details of the computation of the carryover must be submitted\nwith the taxpayer' s New York State personal income tax\nreturn. (d) Rules for\nmaking election. (1)\n\nAn election to\nmodify Federal adjusted gross income for optional depreciation must be made by\nfiling with the New York State personal income tax return or returns in which\nsuch modification is claimed, a statement evidencing such election and\ncontaining complete details of the qualifying property involved and the\ncomputation of the related modification. (Such statement and information must\nbe submitted on form IT-211, New York State Special Depreciation\n\nSchedule.)\n(2)\n\nAn election made\nwith respect to a specific item of property is binding for all subsequent\ntaxable years unless the Department of Taxation and Finance consents to a\nchange with respect thereto upon such terms and conditions as it may\nfix. (3)\n\nAn election with respect\nto qualifying property of a partnership must be made by the partnership and\nwill apply to all partnership members. An election with respect to qualifying\nproperty of an estate or trust must be made by the fiduciary and will be\nbinding on all beneficiaries of the estate and trust. (4)\n\nWhere a taxpayer elects to claim the\ninvestment credit or the retail enterprise credit allowable under section\n606 (a)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsection\n106.1\nof this Title), such taxpayer may not make the subtraction modification\nreferred to in this subdivision (see section\n606[a][3] of the Tax\n\nLaw).
