(a) The eligible person shall notify the\ndepartment eight weeks prior to the starting date of the move of his or her\ndefinite intentions regarding the manner and method of moving. At the option of\nthe department, personnel of the department may conduct an inventory of\npersonal property and merchandise to be moved, including a description of each\nphase of the work to be performed and an explanation of any unusual or peculiar\ncircumstances that will be pertinent to arriving at a comprehensive cost of\nmoving figure. The address of the appropriated property, address the eligible\nperson is moving to and the approximate distance between is to be included\ntherein. This inventory is to be signed by the eligible person and is to be\nsupplied to all estimators and bidders for each phase of the work and they are\nto base their estimates and bids on removal of the items listed therein. The\noccupant may at his or her own expense, obtain competitive bids on the costs of\nmoving and may submit a competitive self-move bid on all or a portion of the\nremoval. (b) Actual costs must be\ndocumented upon receipted, detailed bills from recognized movers, skilled\ncraftsmen and are not to exceed the total of the lowest acceptable bids or\nestimates obtained on each phase of the move. (c) Estimates and bids on each phase of the\nmove shall be obtained by the department from generally recognized, qualified\nmovers and skilled craftsmen. Upon receipt and review of all estimates and\nbids, the department will determine the lowest acceptable bid. This bid will be\nsent to the eligible person advising him or her to commence moving and setting\nforth the limits of reimbursement and the time and manner in which payment will\nbe made. After the removal has been accomplished actual cost must be documented\nby detailed, receipted bills from recognized movers, skilled craftsmen and are\nnot to exceed the approved amount based on a total of the lowest acceptable\nbids or estimates obtained on each phase of the move. All bids from movers and\ncraftsmen must be submitted in accordance with section\n590.6\nof this Part. (d) In the case of a self move the owner of a\nrelocated business may be paid an amount to be negotiated between the State and\nthe business not to exceed the lower of two firm bids or estimates obtained by\nthe State from qualified moving firms. (e) When personal property which is used in\nconnection with the business to be moved is of low value and high bulk and the\nestimated cost of moving would be disproportionate in relation to the value, the State may negotiate with the owner for an amount not to exceed the\ndifference between the cost of replacement of comparable item(s) on the market\nand the amount which would probably have been received for the item(s) on\nliquidation. (f) All books and\nrecords kept by eligible persons shall be subject to review and audit by a\n\nState representative during reasonable business hours. (g) Payment of moving expenses is based upon\nthe preapproval of estimates and bids submitted to the department before\ncommencing the move. If, due to extraordinary circumstances a move is completed\nwithout submitting necessary bids, the commissioner may, upon receipt of\nsufficient written justification for failure to submit estimates, pay\nreasonable and necessary actual expenses upon verification and support for the\nexpenses incurred.
