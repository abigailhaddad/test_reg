(b) Except as otherwise\nprovided in this section, a participant shall be entitled to apply for and\nreceive distribution of a service award only when the participant has acquired\na nonforfeitable right to the service award and has reached entitlement\nage. (c) A service award shall be\npayable only after an application for distribution is filed with the\nadministrator and the administrator approves the application, and shall be paid\nas soon as practicable following approval of the application and the valuation\ndate next succeeding the date the application is received by the administrator. The administrator shall determine whether to approve an application based on\nthe terms of the sponsor's adoption agreement, the records maintained by the\nadministrator and, in the case of disability or death, such additional records\nor information as the administrator may require. The administrator, in its sole\ndiscretion, may require the sponsor, the appropriate ambulance company or the\nparticipant to verify or supply any information the administrator deems\nnecessary to determine entitlement to distribution of a service\naward. (d) In the event that a\nparticipant becomes totally and permanently disabled as certified by the\nworkers' compensation board or by any other competent authority approved by the\nadministrator, and the disability prevents the participant from pursuing his or\nher normal occupation, the participant shall be entitled to apply for and\nreceive distribution of a service award regardless of whether the participant\nhas reached entitlement age or has acquired a nonforfeitable right to a service\naward.
