  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 451.250 - Straight-line method\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe assignment of equal segments of the service cost of\nany item to the benefits to be yielded by the item; a procedure followed in\ndepreciation computations and in the spread of prepaid expenses and bond\ndiscount. In practice, a period charge for depreciation is usually substituted\nfor a more exact measurement of benefits yielded because of: (a) its relative simplicity; (b) the presence of only minor differences\nbetween the two methods; (c) the\nimpossibility of estimating with any degree of realism the total prospective\noutput of services, as in the case of many types of machinery; or\n(d) the absence of any readily determinable\nunit of service, as in the case of buildings. See amortization; apportionment; deferred charge. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n451.250\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
