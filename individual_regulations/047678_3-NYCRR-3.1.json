  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 3.1 - Powers of branches and agencies of foreign banks with respect to the handling of securities\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection\n201-b\nof the\n\nBanking Law permits a branch, which has received a certificate from the\n\nSuperintendent, to exercise fiduciary powers to act as fiscal or transfer agent\nfor the foreign country of its incorporation or for any corporation organized\nunder the laws of such foreign country or doing business there. Branches\nwithout such authorization, and all agencies, are precluded from so acting. Several requests were made for the department's view as to what functions may\nbe performed by agencies and foreign-bank branches, without special\nauthorization under section\n201-b\nof the\n\nBanking Law, on behalf of corporations organized in, or otherwise related to, such bank's country of incorporation. In principle the distinctions between what can be done by\nbranches with fiduciary powers under section\n201-b\nof the\n\nBanking Law as opposed to branches without fiduciary powers or agencies are\npractically identical to those applicable to trust companies, as opposed to\nbanks without trust powers, under section\n100\n(1)\nof the Banking Law. Specifically, banking\nentities lacking fiscal, transfer agent, or other fiduciary powers may\nnonetheless engage in the following types of business: (1) custody for safekeeping of customers' securities, pursuant to instructions by such customers; (2) receipt of dividends on the securities for the account of\nsuch customers, and disposition thereof in accordance with instructions; (3) placing of orders for the purchase or sale of securities\nin accordance with customers' instructions; (4) execution of voting and other rights in connection with\ncustodian accounts and in accordance with customers' instructions; (5) transaction of such business through nominees; and\n(6) receipt of fees or commissions from customers in\nconnection with such business. More difficult questions arise, however, where an entity is\nacting primarily on behalf of or in respect of a particular issuer or issue of\nsecurities, not just with respect to securities (which will often be of widely\nvarying types) owned by and held for customers as such. The department regarded\nit as clear that only authorized fiscal and transfer agents could receive from\nthe issuer and disburse to security holders principal and interest on debt\nsecurities, dividends on equity securities, and similar sums such as\nwithholding reimbursements. Only such agents, moreover, could validate and\neffect issuance, transfer, exchange, conversion (if any) and retirement (as, for instance, by random selection of debt instruments for prepayment) of such\nsecurities, or act as the issuer's agent for service of process, receipt of\nsecurities for forwarding, and like purposes. The foregoing would be true even of so-called \"private\nplacements\" and even if there is a disclaimer, accepted by all parties, of any\nfiduciary relationship between the entity and the security holders. The\napplicable statutes create no exception for issues of limited scope. Moreover, even in the absence of a formal \"fiduciary\" relationship the rights of\ninstitutional purchasers of securities, and ultimately of the small investors\nthey usually represent, can be seriously prejudiced by faulty performance of\nfiscal and transfer duties, which specific departmental grant and supervision\nof fiscal-agency powers was designed to avoid. However, the department did note in conclusion that New York\nagencies and branches without fiduciary powers, under their power to receive\nand transmit funds could, on a \"wholesale\" basis (i.e. in one or a few large\ntransactions substantially without investor contact, except of an interbank\nnature) handle remittances of funds to and from issuers in respect of their\nsecurities issues, and of course, in respect of normal commercial transactions\nincluding customary collections and payments. Foreign-bank agencies in\nparticular would not be expected to retain such remittances for any significant\nlength of time before transmission lest they come to resemble deposits (as\nopposed to credit balances), which agencies are not allowed to receive.
