  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2B.48 - Placement of Parking, Stopping, and Standing Signs\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE the entire section. INSERT the following paragraphs: Standard: 00A Parking sign height shall be in accordance with Section\n2A.18. The minimum height shall apply to the bottom of the lowest sign in an\nassembly of parking signs. 00B Except where otherwise specified, parking signs shall\nbe placed facing approaching traffic at an angle of between 30 and 45 degrees\nwith the line of traffic flow. 00C Parking signs shall be placed at each end of a\nregulation and, within the regulation, at intervals not to exceed 200\nfeet. Option: 00D Where one end of a prohibition is at an intersection, and the regulation extends not more than 200 feet from the intersection, the\nsign at the intersection end may be omitted if a NYP1-9, NYP1-10, or NYP1-11\nsign (with appropriate right or left directional arrow) is used to post the\nother end. Standard: 00E Single-headed arrows pointing in the direction of the\nregulation shall be used on signs posting each end of a regulation. Double-headed arrows shall be used on intermediate signs within the\nregulation. 00F The transition between two different enacted\nregulations shall be posted with appropriate signs for each regulation. The\nR7-202P plaque shall not be used in New York. Guidance: 00G Where an enacted regulation adjoins a statutory\nregulation and the statutory requirement may not be obvious to motorists, the\ntransition for both regulations should be posted. The transition should be\nposted with the two signs (or sign assemblies) mounted side by side, or with an\nR7-200 sign. Posting adjoining regulations with signs one above the other\nshould be avoided, if possible. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2B.48\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
