(C)\n\nWhen expenditures on a research project\nare relatively so large that their inclusion in the operating accounts in the\nyear in which they were incurred would seriously distort those accounts, the\ncompany may request commission approval to defer such expenditures in this\naccount and amortize them over a future period. Without such approval, expenditures charged to this account shall not be carried beyond the year in\nwhich they are incurred.

Such credit to this\naccount and debit to account 410.1 or 410.2 shall, in general, represent the\neffect on taxes payable in the current year of the smaller amount of book\nincome recognized for tax purposes as compared to the amount recognized in the\nutility's current accounts with respect to the item or class of items for which\ndeferred tax accounting by the utility was authorized by the\ncommission. (C)\n\nVintage year\nrecords with respect to entries to this account, as described above, and the\naccount balance, shall be so maintained as to show the factor of calculation\nwith respect to each annual amount of the item or class of items for which\ndeferred tax accounting by the utility is utilized. (D)\n\nThe utility is restricted in its use of\nthis account to the purposes set forth above. It shall not make use of the\nbalance in this account or any portion thereof except as provided in the text\nof this account, without prior approval of the commission.

The utility may not\ntransfer amounts from this account except as authorized herein and in accounts\n411.4, Investment Tax Credit Adjustments, Utility Operations; 411.5, Investment\n\nTax Credit Adjustments, Nonutility Operations; and 420, Investment Tax Credits, or with approval of the commission. (See special instructions for accounts\n411.4 and 411.5.)\n(B)\n\nIf the\ninvestment tax credits deferred in this account are to be applied as a\nreduction of the rate base, the utility shall amortize the amount of such\ndeferrals by debiting this account and crediting account 420, Investment Tax\n\nCredits with a proportionate amount determined in relation to the book service\nlife of the property to which the tax credits relate. If, however, the deferred\ninvestment tax credits are to be applied as a reduction of the cost of service, the proportionate restorations to income shall be credited to account 411.4, Investment Tax Credit Adjustments, Utility Operations. (C)\n\nSubdivisions of this account by\ndepartment shall be maintained for deferred investment tax credits which are\nrelated to utility operations other than water or to nonutility operations. Accounting procedures adopted for utility and nonutility operations are to be\nfollowed on a consistent basis. (D)\n\nSeparate records shall be maintained for each year's investment tax credit for\nwater and other utility operations (by primary utility plant accounts) and for\nnonutility operations, identifying the properties giving rise to the investment\ntax credits for each year so that they can be amortized over the weighted\naverage book service life of such properties. (E)\n\nThe utility is restricted in its use of\nthis account to the purposes set forth above. Unless otherwise authorized by\nthe commission, the utility shall not record in this account amounts of\ninvestment tax credits allowed on property other than that defined in section\n50\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Such\namounts of investment tax credits shall be treated as a current reduction of\nincome tax expense unless the commission has authorized other\ndisposition. Section\n281. Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes-Accelerated\n\nAmortization\n(A)\n\nThis account shall be\ncredited and account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility\n\nOperating Income, or 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income\nand Deductions, as appropriate, shall be debited with an amount equal to that\nby which taxes on income payable for the year are lower because of the use of\naccelerated (five-year) amortization of (1) certified defense facilities in\ncomputing such taxes, as permitted by section\n168\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and\n(2) certified pollution control facilities in computing such taxes, as\npermitted by section\n169\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code of 1954, as compared to the depreciation (deduction) otherwise\nappropriate and allowable for tax purposes according to the straight line or\nother nonaccelerated depreciation method and appropriate estimated useful life\nof such property. (B)\n\nThis account\nshall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Utility Operating Income or 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be credited with an amount\nequal to that by which taxes on income payable for the year are greater because\nof the use in prior years of accelerated (five-year) amortization of (1)\ncertified defense facilities and (2) pollution control facilities instead of\nnonaccelerated or nonliberalized depreciation otherwise appropriate for income\ntax purposes, and deferral of taxes in such prior years as described in\nparagraph A, above. Such debit to this account and credit to account 411.1 or\n411.2, shall, in general, represent the effect of taxes payable for the current\nyear of the unavailability of a depreciation deduction for tax purposes, or a\nreduced amount, with respect to any depreciable property for which accelerated\namortization was used in prior years, as compared to the depreciation deduction\notherwise available and appropriate for such property, considering its\nestimated useful life, according to the depreciation method ordinarily used by\nthe utility for similar property in computing depreciation for tax purposes by\na nonaccelerated or nonliberalized depreciation method. (C)\n\nRecords with respect to entries to this\naccount, as described above, and the account balance, shall be so maintained as\nto show the factors of calculation and the separate amounts applicable to the\nfacilities of each certification or authorization of accelerated amortization\nfor tax purposes. (D)\n\nThe use of\nthis account and the accounting described above are not mandatory for any\nutility which, in accordance with a consistent policy, elects not to follow\ndeferred tax accounting even though accelerated amortization is used in\ncomputing taxes on income. If, however, deferred tax accounting is initiated\nwith respect to any certified defense facility or certified pollution control\nfacility, the accounting shall not be suspended or discontinued on the property\ncovered by that certificate without approval of the commission. (E)\n\nThe utility is restricted in its use of\nthis account to the purpose set forth above. It shall not transfer the balance\nin this account or any portion thereof to retained earnings or make any use\nthereof except as provided in the text of this account without prior approval\nof the commission. Any remaining balance of accumulated deferred taxes with\nrespect to any certified defense facility or certified pollution control\nfacility for which deferred tax accounting has been followed, shall, upon\nexpiration of the estimated useful life of the facility on which deferred tax\ncalculations were based, or upon retirement from service of such facility or\npredominant part thereof be credited to account 411.1, Provision for Deferred\n\nIncome Taxes-Credit, Utility Operating Income, or 411.2, Provision for Deferred\n\nIncome Taxes-Credit, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, or otherwise\nbe applied as the commission may authorize or direct. (F)\n\nUpon the disposition by sale, exchange, transfer, abandonment or premature retirement of plant of which there is a\nrelated balance herein, this account shall be charged with an amount equal to\nthe related income tax expense, if any, arising from such disposition and\naccount 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Utility Operating\n\nIncome, or 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Other Income and\n\nDeductions, as appropriate, shall be credited. When the remaining balance, after consideration of any related income tax expenses, is less than $25,000\nthis account shall be charged and account 411.1 or 411.2, as appropriate, credited with such balance. If after consideration of any related income tax\nexpense, there is a remaining amount of $25,000 or more, the commission shall\nauthorize or direct how such amount shall be accounted for at the time approval\nfor the disposition of accounting is granted. When plant is disposed of by\ntransfer of a wholly owned subsidiary, the related balance in this account\nshall also be transferred. When the disposition related to retirement of an\nitem or items under a group method of depreciation, where there is no tax\neffect in the year of retirement, no entries are required in this account if it\ncan be determined that the related balances would be necessary to be retained\nto offset future group item tax deficiencies. Note: If, in addition to a water utility department, the utility\noperates another utility department or has nonutility property for which\nrelated deferred taxes on income are included in this account, such deferrals\nshall be classified so as to show separately amounts related to the utility\noperating income of each department and to other income and deductions. Section 282. Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes-Liberalized Depreciation\n(A)\n\nThis account, when authorized by the\ncommission, shall be used for the deferral and normalization of tax\ndifferentials resulting from the use of liberalized depreciation as permitted\nby section\n167\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. It\nshall also be used for the deferral and normalization of tax differentials\nresulting from the use of the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range, as provided\nand required by the Revenue Act of 1971. Note: Tax differentials resulting from the current deduction of\nthe cost of removal included in the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range\nprovisions of the Revenue Act of 1971 shall be included in account 283. Also, companies taking liberalized depreciation and flowing through the tax effect on\n\nJanuary 1, 1972, shall continue to flow through these tax effects. (B)\n\nThis account shall be credited\nand account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating\n\nIncome, or 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and\n\nDeductions, as appropriate, shall be debited with an amount equal to that by\nwhich taxes on income payable for the year are lower because of the use of\nliberalized depreciation in computing such taxes, as permitted by section\n167\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as\ncompared to the depreciation deduction otherwise appropriate and allowable for\ntax purposes for similar property of the same estimated useful life according\nto the straight line or other nonliberalized method of depreciation to include\nthose accumulated tax deferrals arising from the use of the Class Life Asset\n\nDepreciation Range, as provided and required by the Revenue Act of\n1971. (C)\n\nThis account shall be\ndebited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Utility\n\nOperating Income, or 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Other\n\nIncome and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be credited with an amount equal\nto that by which taxes on income payable for the year are greater because of\nthe use in prior years of liberalized depreciation for income tax purposes, and\ndeferral of taxes in such prior years as described in paragraph B above. Such\ndebit to this account and credit to account 411.1 or 411.2, shall, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable for the current year of the smaller\namount of depreciation permitted for tax purposes for the current year with\nrespect to any depreciable property for which liberalized depreciation\nincluding Class Life Asset Depreciation Range was used in prior years, as\ncompared to the depreciation deduction otherwise appropriate and available for\nsimilar property of the same estimated useful life according to the straight\nline or other nonliberalized depreciation method ordinarily used by the utility\nin computing depreciation for tax purposes. (D)\n\nRecords with respect to entries to this\naccount, as described above, and the account balance, shall be so maintained as\nto show the factors of calculation and the separate amounts applicable to the\nplant additions of each vintage year for each class, group, or unit as to which\ndifferent liberalized depreciation methods and estimated useful lives have been\nused. The underlying calculations to segregate and associate deferred tax\namounts with the respective vintage years may be based on reasonable methods of\napproximation, if necessary, consistently applied. (E)\n\nExcept for tax deferrals arising from the\nuse of Class Life Asset Depreciation Range, the use of this account and the\naccounting described above are not permitted for any utility even though\nliberalized depreciation is used in computing taxes on income, unless prior\napproval of the commission is obtained. If, as authorized herein, deferred tax\naccounting is initiated with respect to any property, such accounting shall not\nbe discontinued on that property without approval of the commission. (F)\n\nThe utility is restricted in its use of\nthis account to the purposes set forth above. It shall not transfer the balance\nin the account or any portion thereof to retained earnings or make any use\nthereof except as provided in the text of this account without prior approval\nof the commission. Any remaining deferred tax reserve balance with respect to\nany year's plant additions or subdivisions thereof for which liberalized\ndepreciation accounting has been followed or, upon retirement from service of\nsuch property or predominant portion thereof, or upon expiration of the\nestimated useful life on which the depreciation calculations for tax purposes\nare based, shall be credited to account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income\n\nTaxes-Credit, Utility Operating Income, or 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income\n\nTaxes-Credit, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, or otherwise applied\nas the commission may authorize or direct. (G)\n\nUpon the disposition by sale, exchange, transfer, abandonment or premature retirement of plant on which there is a\nrelated balance herein, this account shall be charged with an amount equal to\nthe related income tax expense, if any, arising from such disposition and\naccount 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Utility Operating\n\nIncome, or 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Other Income and\n\nDeductions, as appropriate, shall be credited. When the remaining balance, after consideration of any related income tax expenses, is less than $25,000, this account shall be charged and account 411.1 or 411.2, as appropriate, credited with such balance. If after consideration of any related income tax\nexpense, there is a remaining amount of $25,000 or more, the commission shall\nauthorize or direct how such amount shall be accounted for at the time approval\nfor the disposition of accounting is granted. When plant is disposed of by\ntransfer to a wholly owned subsidiary, the related balance in this account\nshall also be transferred. When the disposition relates to retirement of an\nitem or items under a group method of depreciation where there is no tax effect\nin the year of retirement, no entries are required in this account if it can be\ndetermined the related balances would be necessary to be retained to offset\nfuture group item tax deficiencies. Note: If in addition to a water utility department, the utility\noperates another utility department or has nonutility property for which\nrelated deferred taxes on income are included in this account, such deferrals\nshall be classified so as to show separately amounts related to the utility\noperating income of each department and to other income and deductions. Section 283. Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes-Other\n(A)\n\nThis account, when its use has been\nauthorized by the commission, shall be credited and account 410.1, Provision\nfor Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or 410.2, Provision for\n\nDeferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be\ndebited with an amount equal to that by which taxes on income payable for the\nyear are lower because of the current use of deductions other than accelerated\namortization or liberalized depreciation, in the computation of income taxes\nwhich deductions for general accounting purposes will not be fully reflected in\nthe utility's determination of annual net income until subsequent years. However, commission approval is not required for transactions described in\ngeneral instruction 561.21, subdivision (d), and in account 181, Unamortized\n\nDebt Expense. Also, without commission approval, this account and the\naccounting provided herein shall be used for the deferral and amortization of\nthe tax effects resulting from the current deduction of the cost of removal\nincluded in the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range provisions of the Revenue\n\nAct of 1971. (B)\n\nThis account shall\nbe debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Utility Operating Income, or 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be credited with an amount\nequal to that by which taxes on income payable for the year are greater because\nof deferral of taxes on income in previous years, as provided by paragraph A, above, because of difference in timing for tax purposes of particular income\ndeductions from that recognized by the utility for general accounting purposes, other than with respect to accelerated amortization or liberalized\ndepreciation. Such debit to this account and credit to account 411.1 or 411.2, shall, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable in the current year of\nthe smaller deduction permitted for tax purposes as compared to the amount\nrecognized in the utility's current accounts with respect to the item or class\nof items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility was authorized by the\ncommission. (C)\n\nVintage year\nrecords with respect to entries to this account, as described above, and the\naccount balance, shall be so maintained as to show the factors of calculation\nwith respect to each annual amount of the item or class of items for which\ndeferred tax accounting by the utility is utilized. (D)\n\nThe utility is restricted in its use of\nthis account to the purposes set forth above. It shall not transfer the balance\nin the account or any portion thereof to retained earnings or to any other\naccount or make any use thereof except as provided in the text of this account, without prior approval of the commission. Upon the disposition by sale, exchange, transfer, abandonment or premature retirement of items on which there\nis a related balance herein, this account shall be charged with an amount equal\nto the related income tax effect, if any, arising from such disposition and\naccount 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Utility Operating\n\nIncome, or 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes-Credit, Other Income and\n\nDeductions, shall be credited. When the remaining balance, after consideration\nof any related tax expenses, is less than $25,000, this account shall be\ncharged and account 411.1 or 411.2, as appropriate, credited with such balance. If after consideration of any related income tax expense, there is a remaining\namount of $25,000 or more, the commission shall authorize or direct how such\namount shall be accounted for at the time approval for the disposition of\naccounting is granted. When plant is disposed of by transfer to a wholly owned\nsubsidiary, the related balance in this account shall also be transferred. When\nthe disposition relates to retirement of an item or items under a group method\nof depreciation where there is no tax effect in the year of retirement, no\nentries are required in this account if it can be determined that the related\nbalance would be necessary to be retained to offset future group item tax\ndeficiencies. Note: In determining appropriate use of this account as a basis\nof request to the commission for authorization of its use, for the deferral of\ntaxes, consideration shall be given to the relative importance of the amount\ninvolved, and to other items in the utility's accounts where \"prepaid tax\naccounting\" may be appropriate such as situations (a) where the time of taking\na deduction in computing taxes on income is such that the tax deduction must be\ndelayed or applied to a series of future years as opposed to earlier\nrecognition of such item in determination of income in the general accounts of\nthe utility or (b) where inclusion of an income item is required for tax\npurposes but is to be recognized in whole or in part in the utility's income\naccounts of a subsequent year or years.
