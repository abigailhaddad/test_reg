  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.903 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following definitions apply to sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part: (a) Assessment is the use of testing\ntechniques as allowed in sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part to ascertain\nthe condition of a covered pipeline segment. (b) Confirmatory direct assessment is an\nintegrity assessment method using more focused application of the principles\nand techniques of direct assessment to identify internal and external corrosion\nin a covered transmission pipeline segment. (c) Covered segment or covered pipeline\nsegment means a segment of gas transmission pipeline located in a high\nconsequence area. The terms gas and transmission line are defined in section\n255.3\nof this Part. (d) Direct assessment is an integrity\nassessment method that utilizes a process to evaluate certain threats (i.e., external corrosion, internal corrosion and stress corrosion cracking) to a\ncovered pipeline segment's integrity. The process includes the gathering and\nintegration of risk factor data, indirect examination or analysis to identify\nareas of suspected corrosion, direct examination of the pipeline in these\nareas, and post assessment evaluation. (e) High consequence area means an area\nestablished by one of the methods described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this\nsubdivision as follows: (1)\n\nAn area defined\nas: (i) a Class 3 location under section\n255.5\nof this Part; or\n(ii)\na Class 4 location under section\n255.5\nof this Part; or\n(iii)\nany area in a Class 1 or Class 2\nlocation where the potential impact radius is greater than 660 feet (200\nmeters), and the area within a potential impact circle contains 20 or more\nbuildings intended for human occupancy; or\n(iv)\nany area in a Class 1 or Class 2\nlocation where the potential impact circle contains an identified\nsite. (2)\n\nThe area\nwithin a potential impact circle containing: (i) 20 or more buildings intended for human\noccupancy, unless the exception in paragraph (4) of this subdivision applies; or\n(ii)\nan identified\nsite. (3)\n\nWhere a\npotential impact circle is calculated under either paragraph (1) or (2) of this\nsubdivision to establish a high consequence area, the length of the high\nconsequence area extends axially along the length of the pipeline from the\noutermost edge of the first potential impact circle that contains either an\nidentified site or 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy to the\noutermost edge of the last contiguous potential impact circle that contains\neither an identified site or 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy. (See Figure 1 in Appendix 14-E.)\n(4)\n\nIf in identifying a high consequence area\nunder subparagraph (1)(iii) of this subdivision or subparagraph (2)(i) of this\nsubdivision, the radius of the potential impact circle is greater than 660 feet\n(200 meters), the operator may identify a high consequence area based on a\nprorated number of buildings intended for human occupancy within a distance 660\nfeet (200 meters) from the centerline of the pipeline until December 17, 2006. If an operator chooses this approach, the operator must prorate the number of\nbuildings intended for human occupancy based on the ratio of an area with a\nradius of 660 feet (200 meters) to the area of the potential impact circle\n(i.e., the prorated number of buildings intended for human occupancy is equal\nto 20 x 660 feet (or 200 meters)/potential impact radius in feet or\nmeters2.)\n(f) Identified\nsite means each of the following areas: (1)\n\nAn\noutside area or open structure that is occupied by 20 or more persons on at\nleast 50 days in any 12-month period. (The days need not be consecutive.)\n\nExamples include but are not limited to, beaches, playgrounds, recreational\nfacilities, camping grounds, outdoor theaters, stadiums, recreational areas\nnear a body of water, or areas outside a rural building such as a religious\nfacility. (2)\nA building that is\noccupied by 20 or more persons on at least five days a week for 10 weeks in any\n12-month period. (The days and weeks need not be consecutive.) Examples\ninclude, but are not limited to, religious facilities, office buildings, community centers, general stores, 4-H facilities, or roller skating\nrinks. (3)\nA facility occupied by\npersons who are confined, are of impaired mobility, or would be difficult to\nevacuate. Examples include but are not limited to hospitals, prisons, schools, day-care facilities, retirement facilities or assisted-living\nfacilities. (g) Potential impact circle is a circle of radius equal to the potential impact\nradius (PIR). (h) Potential impact\nradius (PIR) means the radius of a circle within which the potential failure of\na pipeline could have significant impact on people or property. PIR is\ndetermined by the formula r = 0.69* (square root of (p*d2)), where 'r' is the\nradius of a circular area in feet surrounding the point of failure, 'p' is the\nmaximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) in the pipeline segment in pounds\nper square inch and 'd' is the nominal diameter of the pipeline in inches. Note:0.69 is the factor for natural gas. This number will\nvary for other gases depending upon their heat of combustion. An operator\ntransporting gas other than natural gas must use section\n3.2\nof ASME/ANSI B31.8S (as\ndescribed in section\n10.3\nof this Title) to calculate\nthe impact radius formula. (i) Remediation is a repair or mitigation\nactivity an operator takes on a covered segment to limit or reduce the\nprobability of an undesired event occurring or the expected consequences from\nthe event. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.903\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
