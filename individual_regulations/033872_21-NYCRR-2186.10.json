  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2186.10 - Modification, reduction or termination of grant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Modification of grant assistance. The\ngrant assistance may be canceled in whole or in part for mutual convenience if\nboth parties agree that the project's continuation is infeasible or would not\nproduce beneficial results commensurate with the further expenditure of funds. Approval of requests for increased grant assistance after grant agreement\nexecution rests solely in the discretion of the agency. (b) Reduction or termination of grant. The\nagency may terminate the grantee's entire grant or the remaining balance for\ncause. When the agency determines that a grantee has failed to meet one or more\nof the requirements of the grant agreement, or, as the case may be, the\nregulatory agreement, the agency may reduce or recapture the grant, including\namounts already obligated, or take other appropriate action. If the agency\ndetermines that the grantee has not met the requirements of the grant\nagreement, or, as the case may be, the regulatory agreement, the grantee will\nbe notified and given an opportunity within a prescribed time to show that it\nhas done so or has taken curative action. If the grantee fails to demonstrate\nthat it has done so, the agency may take appropriate corrective or remedial\naction. For purposes of this section, appropriate action means any remedial\naction legally available, including, without limitation, demanding in writing\nthat the grantee reimburse (and the grantee will reimburse) the agency in the\namount of the ineligible costs, and bringing affirmative litigation, such as\nsuits for declaratory judgment specific performance, temporary or permanent\ninjunctions and any other available remedies. In the event that the agency\nmakes such a determination, then the grantee will deliver to the agency all\noriginal documents relevant to the project(s) or program, including but not\nlimited to, any construction agreements, loan documents and any other related\ndocuments that the agency may require. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n2186.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
