  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 57.9 - Laboratory procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Double strength skim milk. Double strength skim milk shall be prepared\nutilizing laboratory grade commercial dehydrated skim milk. Reconstitute\naccording to label directions with the exception that the concentration shall\nbe doubled; (i.e., 2x). Since reconstitution will cause foaming, an\nappropriately large container must be used. The liquid product shall be\nautoclaved at 121° C, 15 pounds pressure for 15 minutes. Avoid overheating\nsince this can cause carmelization. Cool slowly, protect from contamination and\nrefrigerate at between 2° and 4° C. Do not use if stored for more than two\nweeks. (b) Organ culture. (1)\n\nVisceral organs. (i) Remove aseptically from each bird the\napex of heart, piece of liver, gall bladder, spleen, ovary and the upper 4-6\ninches of the oviduct. Other visceral organs with pathological lesions shall be\nincluded in the culture. The organs obtained from each individual bird shall\nconstitute an organ set. (ii)\n\nThe\norgan set from each bird shall be processed separately. If the evaluation of\nthe birds involves multiple houses on a single farm site, the approved\nlaboratory may pool the organ sets of not more than five birds from all of the\nhouses except one. The organ sets from the birds in the remaining house shall\nbe processed separately. Seronegative birds shall be pooled separately from\nseropositive birds if organs are pooled. (iii)\n\nMince or homogenize organ sets in equal\nvolumes of buffered diluent. Transfer 10 mls. of homogenate to 90 mls. of\nselective enrichment broth (TT Hajna, or tetrathionate brilliant\ngreen). (iv)\n\nIncubate samples from\ntissues for 24 hours at 37° C. (v) Plate on brilliant-green agar or XLD with 15 mcg/ml of pure novobiocin and a\nsecond media such as BG, XLD or XLT-4. Only one of the two media shall contain\nnovobiocin. The selection of the two mediums shall be based on their\ncomplimentary ability to select Salmonella of differing biochemical\nproperties. (vi)\n\nIncubate plates\nfor 24 hours at 37° C. Select aminimum of five suspect colonies per plate and\ntransfer to TSI or LIA or select up to nine colonies for screening using the\n\nWorld Health Organization Salmonella polyvalent bacteriophage 01-0E protocol. If either or both develop typical reactions, proceed to serology from TSI\nslants with polyvalent serum for identification and then\nserogrouping. (vii)\n\nSelect a\nminimum of five group D isolates per case for serotype and phage type\ndetermination and send isolates to National Veterinary Services Laboratory\n(NVSL) for determination. (c) Environmental culture. (1)\n\nFor samples obtained from litter, manure\nscraper, egg belts, dead embryos, or meconium: (i) Place samples in selective enrichment\nbroth at a ratio of 1 part sample to 10 parts broth (TT Hajna or tetrathionate\nbrilliant green). (ii)\n\nNo samples\nshall be pooled after receipt at the approved laboratory. (iii)\n\nIncubate samples for 24 hours at 42°\nC. (iv)\n\nPlate on brilliant-green\nagar or XLD with 15 mcg/ml of pure novobiocin and a second media such as BG, XLD or XLT-4. Only one of these two media shall contain novobiocin. The\nselection of the two mediums shall be based on their complimentary ability to\nselect Salmonella of differing biochemical properties. (v) Continue incubating selective enrichment\nbroth culture an additional 24 hours after initial plating or hold 5-7 days at\nroom temperature. Transfer 0.25 ml. of all Salmonella-negative original\nenrichment broth cultures to 10 ml. fresh enrichment broth and incubate the\nsecondary enrichment broth at either 37° C or 42° C for 24 hours. (vi)\n\nPlate secondary enrichment broth as in\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. (vii)\n\nIncubate plates for 24 hours at 37° C. Select a minimum of five suspect colonies per plate and transfer to TSI or LIA\nor select up to nine colonies for screening using the World Health Organization\n\nSalmonella polyvalent bacteriophage 01-0E protocol. If either or both plates\ndevelop typical reactions, proceed to serology OE protocol. If either or both\nplates develop typical reactions, proceed to serology from TSI slants with\npolyvalent serum for identification and then serogrouping. (viii)\n\nSelect a minimum of five group D\nisolates per case for serotype and phage type determination and send isolates\nto National Veterinary Services Laboratory for determination. (d) The forwarding of\n\nSalmonella enteritidis cultures to cooperating research laboratories for\nfurther study is recommended. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n57.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
