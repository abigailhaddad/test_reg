(i) All public elementary, intermediate, middle, junior high schools, and high schools, other than charter\nschools, in existence on September 1, 2002 shall be deemed registered by the\n\nBoard of Regents pursuant to this subdivision as of such date. (ii)\nA school district that seeks to register\na public elementary, intermediate, middle, junior high school or high school\nwhich is not registered pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall\nsubmit a petition for registration to the Board of Regents, in a form\nprescribed by the commissioner and containing such information as the\ncommissioner may require, no later than June 15th for schools opening in\n\nSeptember of the next successive school year or, for those schools opening\nduring a current school year, at least 90 days prior the opening of such\nschool, except that the commissioner may waive this timeline for good cause. The commissioner shall review the petition and shall recommend its approval to\nthe Board of Regents if it is satisfactorily demonstrated that the district has\nprovided an assurance that the school will be operated in an educationally\nsound manner; is in compliance with applicable statutes, rules and regulations\nrelating to public schools; and will operate in accordance with applicable\nbuilding codes and pursuant to a certificate of occupancy. No new public school\nwill be recommended for registration by the commissioner if, in the\ncommissioner's judgment, the establishment of such school would conflict with\nan approved plan for district reorganization, except where it can be\nestablished to the satisfaction of the commissioner that such school is\nessential to the education welfare of the students. (a) Where a school registered pursuant to\nthis paragraph is in a district in which one or more schools have been\ndesignated as a school in improvement, corrective action or restructuring, the\ncommissioner shall determine the accountability status of the newly registered\nschool based upon his review of the proposed educational program, including but\nnot limited to such factors as: school mission, school administration and\nstaff, grade configurations and groupings of students, zoning patterns, curricula and instruction and facilities. (b) In the event that a school district\nmerges two or more schools or transfers organizational responsibility for one\nor more grades from one school to another, the commissioner may adjust the\naccountability status of the affected schools to reflect such organizational\nchanges. (3)\n\nAll registrations approved by the Board of Regents pursuant to this subdivision\nshall continue in effect unless revoked by the Board of Regents upon\nrecommendation of the commissioner after review of the registration, or the\nschool district closes the school. (4)\n\nSystem of accountability for student\nsuccess. Each year, commencing with 2002-2003 school year test administration\nresults, the commissioner shall review the performance of all public schools, charter schools and school districts in the State. For each accountability\nperformance criterion specified in paragraph (14) and each performance\nindicator specified in paragraph (15) of this subdivision, the commissioner, commencing with 2002-2003 school year test administration results, shall\ndetermine whether each public school, charter school and school district has\nachieved adequate yearly progress as set forth in paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision. (5)\n\nAdequate yearly\nprogress. (i) A public school, charter school\nor school district shall be deemed to have made adequate yearly progress on an\naccountability performance criterion set forth in paragraph (14) of this\nsubdivision if each accountability group within such school or district\nachieved adequate yearly progress on that criterion. (ii)\n\nIn public schools, charter schools or\nschool districts with fewer than 30 students subject to an accountability\nperformance criterion set forth in paragraphs (14) and (15) of this\nsubdivision, the commissioner shall use the weighted average of the current and\nprior school year's performance data for that criterion in order to make a\ndetermination of adequate yearly progress. No public school, charter school or\nschool district will be held accountable for any other accountability group\nconsisting of fewer than 30 students as long as the \"all student\"\naccountability group includes at least 30 students for that school\nyear. (iii)\n\nFor purposes of\ndetermining adequate yearly progress, only the performance of continuously\nenrolled students in grades 3-8 shall be included for consideration. (iv)\n\nAn accountability group shall be deemed\nto have made adequate yearly progress on an accountability performance\ncriterion specified in paragraph (14) of this subdivision if: (a) the superintendent of the school district\nor the principal of the charter school has submitted the required student data\nfiles to the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (bb)(2) of this section or\nsection\n119.3\n(b) of this\n\nTitle in the timeframe and format specified by the commissioner; and\n(b) for accountability groups consisting of\n40 or more students, either: (1)\nthe\nparticipation rate for the current year equals or exceeds 95 percent; or\n(2)\nthe weighted average of the\ncurrent year and prior year participation rates equals or exceeds 95\npercent; (c) for\naccountability groups consisting of 30 or more students: (1)\nthe accountability group met or exceeded, or did not differ significantly as determined by the commissioner, from the\nannual measurable objective for that criterion; or\n(2)\nthe accountability group met or exceeded, or did not differ significantly as determined by the commissioner, from an\nannual performance target established by the commissioner and the\naccountability group met or exceeded the third performance indicator at that\ngrade level, as defined in paragraph (15) of this subdivision. (v) A public school, charter school or school district shall be deemed to have made adequate yearly\nprogress on a performance indicator specified in paragraph (15) of this\nsubdivision if: (a) the superintendent of the\nschool district or the principal of the charter school has submitted the\nrequired student data files to the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (bb)(2)\nof this section or section\n119.3\n(b) of this\n\nTitle in the timeframe and format specified by the commissioner; and\n(b) the \"all students\" accountability group\nin the school or school district at the applicable grade levels or high school\ncohort met or exceeded the performance indicator and, for elementary and middle\nlevels, and beginning in 2005-2006 for the elementary-middle level, 80 percent\nof students enrolled on all days of the science test administration, who did\nnot have a significant medical emergency, received valid scores. (vi)\n\nFor each school year, public\nschools, school districts, and charter schools in which no students or, pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph fewer than 30 students, participate in the required State assessments for English language arts or\nmathematics, or in which the majority of students are not continuously\nenrolled, shall conduct a self-assessment of their academic program and the\nschool learning environment, in such format and using such criteria as may be\nprescribed by the commissioner. Such self-assessment shall not be required of\nthose schools and school districts for which the commissioner shall conduct a\nreview of the performance of the school or school district in accordance with\nsubparagraph (viii) of this paragraph. The superintendent of the school\ndistrict or principal of the charter school shall review the self-assessment(s)\nand make a recommendation to the commissioner, in such format and according to\nsuch timeframe as the commissioner may prescribe, as to whether the school or\nschool district has made adequate yearly progress. The commissioner shall\nconsider the self-assessment, board recommendation and any other relevant\ninformation in determining whether the school or school district made adequate\nyearly progress. (vii)\n\nThe school\naccountability status of public schools, school districts, and charter schools\nserving grades 1 and/or 2, but not grade 3 or higher, (hereafter referred to as\n\"feeder schools\") will be determined using backmapping. In school districts\nwith such feeder schools and in school districts that accept grade 3 students\nfrom feeder schools by contract, the grade three State assessment results for\neach feeder school student will be attributed to the feeder school as well as\nto the school or charter school in which the student took the assessment. The\nstudent's results will be attributed to a feeder school only if the student was\ncontinuously enrolled in the feeder school from the date prescribed by the\ncommissioner on which the BEDS forms are required to be completed until the end\nof the school year in the highest grade served by the feeder school. In a\ndistrict, if all schools serving grade three make adequate yearly progress in a\ngiven year, all feeder schools served by the district will be deemed to have\nmade adequate yearly progress. If one or more schools enrolling students from a\nfeeder school fail to make adequate yearly progress on a criterion set forth at\nsubparagraphs (14)(iii) and (vi) of this subdivision, the commissioner will\naggregate the district's grade three results on that criterion by feeder school\nand determine whether each feeder school made adequate yearly progress on that\ncriterion. If a feeder school fails to make adequate yearly progress on the\nsame criterion for two consecutive years, the school will be designated as a\nschool in improvement (year 1). (6)\n\nDifferentiated accountability for\nschools. (i) Except as provided in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, beginning with the 2009-2010 school year\nand thereafter, public schools, and charter schools that receive funds under\ntitle I, that failed to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) pursuant to this\nsubparagraph shall be designated into accountability phases and phase\ncategories as follows: (a) Accountability\nphases. (1)\n\nImprovement phase. (i) A school that fails to make AYP for two\nconsecutive years on the same accountability performance criterion in paragraph\n(14) of this subdivision or the same accountability indicator in paragraph (15)\nof this subdivision shall be designated in the next school year as a school in\nimprovement (year 1) for that accountability performance\ncriterion/accountability indicator. (ii)\nA school that is designated as a school\nin improvement (year 1) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability\nperformance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been\nidentified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in\nimprovement (year 2) for that accountability performance\ncriterion/accountability indicator. (2)\n\nCorrective action phase. (i) A school that is designated as a school\nin improvement (year 2) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability\nperformance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been\nidentified as a school in improvement (year 2) shall be designated in the next\nschool year as a school in corrective action (year 1) for that accountability\nperformance criterion/accountability indicator. (ii)\nA school that is designated as a school\nin corrective action (year 1) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability\nperformance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been\nidentified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in\ncorrective action (year 2) for that accountability performance\ncriterion/accountability indicator. (3)\n\nRestructuring phase. (i) A school that is designated as a school\nin corrective action (year 2) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability\nperformance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been\nidentified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in\nrestructuring (year 1) for that accountability performance\ncriterion/accountability indicator. (ii)\nA school that is designated as a school\nin restructuring (year 1) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability\nperformance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been\nidentified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in\nrestructuring (year 2) for that accountability performance\ncriterion/accountability indicator. (iii)\nA school that is designated as a school\nin restructuring (year 2) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability\nperformance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been\nidentified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in\nrestructuring (advanced) for that accountability performance\ncriterion/accountability indicator. (b) Phase categories. (1)\n\nImprovement phase. Schools designated in\nimprovement shall be assigned to a category upon entry into the phase as\nfollows: (i) Basic: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for one\naccountability group within one accountability performance criterion, but not\nthe all students group; or\n(B)\nschools that fail to make AYP for one of the accountability indicators, but met\nthe accountability performance criterion. (ii)\n\nFocused: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for more\nthan one accountability performance criterion, but not the all students group; or\n(B)\nschools that fail to make\nAYP for more than one accountability student group within an accountability\nperformance criterion, but not the all students group. (iii)\n\nComprehensive: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for the all\nstudents group on any accountability performance criterion; or\n(B)\nschools that fail to make AYP for every\naccountability group, except the all students group, within an accountability\ncriterion for which there are at least two accountability groups other than the\nall students group; or\n(C)\nschools\nthat fail to make AYP for an accountability performance criterion and for an\nindicator. (2)\n\nCorrective action or restructuring phase. Schools designated in corrective\naction or restructuring shall be assigned to a category upon entry into the\nphase as follows: (i) Focused: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for one of\nthe accountability indicators, but met the accountability performance\ncriterion; or\n(B)\nschools that fail\nto make AYP for more than one accountability performance criterion, but not\nwith the all students group; or\n(C)\nschools that fail to make AYP for one or more accountability groups within an\naccountability performance criterion, but not the all students group. (ii)\n\nComprehensive: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for the all\nstudents group on any accountability performance criterion; or\n(B)\nschools that fail to make AYP for every\naccountability group, except the all students group, within an accountability\nperformance criterion for which there are at least two accountability groups\nother than the all students group; or\n(C)\nschools that fail to make AYP for an\naccountability performance criterion and for an accountability\nindicator. (c) The commissioner shall designate a\nschool's overall accountability status as the most advanced phase for which it\nhas been identified on an accountability performance criterion/accountability\nindicator and, within that designated phase, shall assign the highest category, provided that such category may not be reduced in a subsequent year of a\nphase. (d) Upon a finding of\nexceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, the commissioner may delay for a\nperiod of one year the designation of a school under this paragraph. (ii)\n\nSpecial transition provisions\nfor schools in operation during the 2008-2009 school year and for schools under\nregistration review. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph: (a) for each public school that\nwas in operation during the 2008-2009 school year and for each charter school\nthat was in operation and received funds under title I during the 2008-2009\nschool year, the commissioner shall designate the school's accountability phase\nand phase category for the 2009-2010 school year, based upon the school's\naccountability status for the 2008-2009 school year and the school's adequate\nyearly progress (AYP) status for the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 school\nyears; (b) notwithstanding the\nprovisions of clause (a) of this subparagraph, a school that is identified for\nregistration review pursuant to paragraph (9) of this subdivision during a\nschool year in which it is designated as a school in improvement or corrective\naction shall, in the next school year, be designated as a school in\nrestructuring (year 1)/comprehensive and shall be subject to the requirements\nof subclause (iv)(\nc\n)(\n2\n) of this\nparagraph. (iii)\n\nRemoval\nfrom accountability designation. A school that makes adequate yearly progress\nfor two consecutive years on the accountability performance\ncriterion/accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be\nremoved from accountability designation for that accountability performance\ncriterion and/or accountability indicator. (iv)\n\nInterventions. (a) Improvement phase schools. (1)\n\nSchool quality review.

(i) Commencing with 2003-2004 school\nyear results, a district that failed to make adequate yearly progress on all\napplicable criteria in paragraph (14) of this subdivision in a subject area, or\nall applicable indicators in subparagraphs (15)(i) through (iii) of this\nsubdivision, or the indicator in subparagraph (15)(iv) of this subdivision, for\ntwo consecutive years shall be designated as a \"district requiring academic\nprogress.\" A district improvement plan in such format as may be prescribed by\nthe commissioner shall be developed by each district requiring academic\nprogress. Such district improvement plan shall be formally approved by the\nboard of education (in New York City, both the New York City Board of Education\nand the community school board for schools under the jurisdiction of the\ncommunity school district) no later than three months following the\nidentification of the district as requiring academic progress and submitted to\nthe commissioner for approval. The plan shall be implemented no later than\nbeginning of the next school year after the school year in which the school\ndistrict was identified as requiring academic progress or immediately, to the\nextent practicable, upon approval of the board, if such identification occurs\nafter the first day of regular student attendance. Such plan shall be developed\nin consultation with parents, school, staff, and others. The plan shall be\nrevised annually and resubmitted to the commissioner for approval no later than\n\nJuly 31st of each school year in which the district remains identified as\nrequiring academic progress. Any modification of the district's approved\nimprovement plan shall require the prior approval of the\ncommissioner.

(9)\n\nIdentification of schools for public\nschool registration review. (i) Up through\nand including the 2009-2010 school year, the commissioner shall place under\nregistration review those schools that are determined to be farthest from\nmeeting the benchmarks established by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph\n(14)(ix) of this subdivision and most in need of improvement. (ii)\n\nBeginning with the 2010-2011 school year\nand thereafter, the commissioner shall place under preliminary registration\nreview a school that is identified as persistently lowest-achieving in such\nschool year. A school identified as persistently lowest-achieving in the\n2009-2010 school year, that was not a school under registration review during\nthe 2009-2010 school year, shall not be placed under registration review but\nshall follow the intervention and other applicable requirements in\nsubparagraphs (10)(ii) and (iv) of this subdivision. (a) A school shall be identified as\npersistently lowest-achieving if, based upon the academic indicators set forth\nin clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, it is: (1)\na Title I school in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that: (i) is among the lowest-achieving five percent of Title I schools in improvement, corrective action or restructuring, or the lowest achieving five Title I\nschools in improvement, corrective action or restructuring, whichever number of\nschools is greater; or\n(ii)\nis a\nhigh school that has a graduation rate, as defined in subparagraph (15)(iv) of\nthis subdivision, that is less than 60 percent over the three consecutive year\nperiod for which accountability determinations have been made pursuant to this\nsubdivision; or\n(2)\na\nsecondary school that is eligible for, but does not receive, Title I funds\nthat: (i) is among the lowest-achieving five\npercent of secondary schools or the lowest-achieving five secondary schools in\nthe State that are eligible for, but do not receive, Title I funds, whichever\nnumber of schools is greater; or\n(ii)\nis a high school that has a graduation\nrate, as defined in subparagraph (15)(iv) of this subdivision, that is less\nthan 60 percent over the three consecutive year period for which accountability\ndeterminations have been made. (b) A school shall be identified as\npersistently lowest-achieving based on the following academic indicators: (1)\nthe performance of the school's \"all\nstudents\" group on the State assessments in English language arts and\nmathematics combined, which shall be determined by dividing the sum of the \"all\nstudents\" performance index for each English language arts and mathematics\nmeasure for which the school is accountable by the number of measures for which\nthe school is accountable; and\n(2)\nthe school's lack of progress on the State assessments in English language arts\nand mathematics over three years. A school shall be deemed to have demonstrated\nlack of progress if: (i) the school is\ndesignated as a school in restructuring; and\n(ii)\nthe school has failed to demonstrate, over the three consecutive year period for which accountability determinations\nhave been made pursuant to this subdivision, at least a 25 point gain in its\nperformance index for the \"all students\" group in each English language arts\nand mathematics measure for which the school is held accountable; and/or\n(3)\nthe school has\na graduation rate, as defined in subparagraph (15)(iv) of this subdivision, that is less than 60 percent over the three consecutive year period for which\naccountability determinations have been made pursuant to this\nsubdivision. (iii)\n\nThe commissioner shall also place under\npreliminary registration review a school that is not otherwise eligible to be\nidentified as persistently lowest-achieving that meets the academic indicators\nin clause (ii)(\nb\n) of this paragraph to be identified as a\npersistently lowest-achieving school: (a) is\na school in which more than 50 percent of the total student enrollment consists\nof students with disabilities; or\n(b) is a non-Title I elementary school or a\nnon-Title I eligible secondary school. (iv)\n\nThe commissioner may also place under\npreliminary registration review any school that has conditions that threaten\nthe health, safety and/or educational welfare of students or has been the\nsubject of persistent complaints to the department by parents or persons in\nparental relation to the student, and has been identified by the commissioner\nas a poor learning environment based upon a combination of factors affecting\nstudent learning, including but not limited to: high rates of student\nabsenteeism, high levels of school violence, excessive rates of student\nsuspensions, violation of applicable building health and safety standards, high\nrates of teacher and administrator turnover, excessive rates of referral of\nstudents to or participation in special education or excessive rates of\nparticipation of students with disabilities in the alternate assessment, excessive transfers of students to alternative high school and high school\nequivalency programs and excessive use of uncertified teachers or teachers in\nsubject areas other than those for which they possess certification. (v) The commissioner may also place under\nregistration review any school for which a district fails to provide in a\ntimely manner the student performance data required by the commissioner to\nconduct the annual assessment of the school's performance or any school in\nwhich excessive percentages of students fail to fully participate in the State\nassessment program. (vi)\n\nBeginning\nin the 2010-2011 school year, for each school identified for preliminary\nregistration review pursuant to subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, the local school district shall be given the opportunity to present to the\ncommissioner additional assessment data, which may include, but need not be\nlimited to, valid and reliable measures of: the performance of students in\ngrades other than those in which the State tests are administered; the\nperformance of limited English proficient students and/or other students with\nspecial needs; and the progress that specific grades have made or that cohorts\nof students in the school have made towards demonstrating higher student\nperformance. For each school identified as a poor learning environment and\nplaced under preliminary registration review pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of\nthis paragraph, the district shall be given the opportunity to present evidence\nto the commissioner that the conditions in the school do not threaten the\nhealth or safety or educational welfare of students and do not adversely affect\nstudent performance. The district may also provide relevant information\nconcerning extraordinary, temporary circumstances faced by the school that may\nhave affected the performance of students in the school on the State\ntests. (vii)\n\nThe commissioner shall\nreview the additional information provided by the district and determine which\nof the schools identified for preliminary registration review pursuant to\nsubparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, or identified as poor learning\nenvironments pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, shall be placed\nunder registration review. (viii)\n\nIn determining the number of schools to place under registration review, other\nthan persistently lowest-achieving schools identified pursuant to subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, the commissioner may consider the sufficiency of State\nand local resources to effectively implement and monitor school improvement\nefforts in schools under registration review. (ix)\n\nFor schools required to conduct a\nself-assessment pursuant to subparagraph (5)(vi) of this subdivision, the\ncommissioner upon review of the self-assessment may make a determination that\nthe school shall be placed under registration review. (10)\n\nPublic school registration review. (i) Upon placing the registration of a school\nunder review, the commissioner shall warn the board of education (in New York\n\nCity, the chancellor) that the school has been placed under registration\nreview, and that the school is at risk of having its registration revoked. The\ncommissioner shall include in any warning issued pursuant to this subparagraph\nan explicit delineation of the progress that must be demonstrated in order for\na school to be removed from consideration for revocation of registration.

Such action shall include, but need not be limited to, direct notification, within 30 days of receipt of\nthe commissioner's warning, in English and translated, when appropriate, into\nthe recipient's native language or mode of communication, to persons in\nparental relation of children attending the school that it has been placed\nunder registration review and is at risk of having its registration revoked, and disclosure by the district at the next public meeting of the local board of\neducation of such warning. Each school year during which a school remains under\nregistration review, by June 30th or at the time of a student's initial\napplication or admission to the school, whichever is earliest, the board of\neducation shall provide direct notification to parents or other persons in\nparental relation to children attending the school that the school remains\nunder registration review and is at risk of having its registration revoked. Such notification shall include a summary of the actions that the district and\nschool are taking to improve student results and an explanation of any district\nprograms of choice, magnet programs, transfer policies, or other options that a\nparent or a person in parental relation may have to place the child in a\ndifferent public school within the district. Such notification shall include\nthe timelines and process for parents exercising their rights to school\nchoice. (ii)\n\nFollowing the\nplacement of a school under registration review, or following the\nidentification of a school as persistently lowest-achieving in the 2009-2010\nschool year, a joint intervention team, as appointed by the commissioner, shall\nassist the school district in which such school is located in selecting an\nintervention pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. The district\nshall develop a new restructuring plan, or update an existing restructuring\nplan, that shall, in addition to the requirements pursuant to subclause\n(6)(iv)(\nc\n)(\n2\n) of this subdivision, describe\nthe implementation of the intervention. Such plan shall be in a format as\nprescribed by the commissioner. The district shall update the plan annually for\nimplementation no later than the first day of the regular student attendance of\neach school year that the designation continues. The school shall implement the\nintervention in accordance with a timeline prescribed by the commissioner, and\nno later than the beginning of the next school year following the school's\nidentification for registration review, provided that the commissioner may upon\na finding of good cause extend the timeline for implementing elements of such\nplan beyond the date prescribed therein.

Such reports shall be in a format\nand in accordance with such timeframe as are prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner may upon a finding of good cause extend the deadline for\nsubmission of a restructuring plan. (vi)\n\nUnless it is determined by the\ncommissioner that a school identified for registration review should be phased\nout or closed, or that a shorter period of time shall be granted, a school\nplaced under registration review shall be given three full academic years to\nshow progress. If, after three full academic years of implementing a\nrestructuring plan, the school has not demonstrated progress as delineated by\nthe commissioner in the warning pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the commissioner shall recommend to the Board of Regents that the registration\nbe revoked and the school be declared an unsound educational environment, except that the commissioner may upon a finding of extenuating circumstances\nextend the period during which the school must demonstrate progress. The board\nof education of the school district which operates the school (in New York\n\nCity, the chancellor) shall be afforded notice of such recommendation and an\nopportunity to be heard in accordance with subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. Upon approval of revocation of registration by the Board of Regents, the\ncommissioner will develop a plan to ensure that the educational welfare of the\npupils of the school is protected. Such plan shall specify the instructional\nprogram into which pupils who had attended the school will be placed, how their\nparticipation in the specified programs will be funded, and the measures that\nwill be taken to ensure that the selected placements appropriately meet the\neducational needs of the pupils. The commissioner shall require the board of\neducation to implement such plan. (vii)\n\nDecisions to revoke the registration of\na public school shall be made in accordance with the following procedures: (a) The commissioner shall provide written\nnotice of his recommendation and the reasons therefor to the board of\neducation, which operates the school (in New York City, both the New York City\n\nBoard of Education and any community school board having jurisdiction over the\nschool).

(11)\n\nRemoval of schools from registration\nreview, school phase-out or closure. (i) In\nthe event that a school has demonstrated the progress necessary to be removed\nfrom registration review, the superintendent may petition the commissioner to\nremove the school from registration review. If such petition is based upon\nresults of the \"all student\" group on the English language arts and mathematics\nassessments or graduation rate, such petition shall be submitted pursuant to a\ndate prescribed by the commissioner but no later than December 31st of the\ncalendar year in which such assessments were administered, except that the\ncommissioner may for good cause accept a petition submitted after such date. A\nschool shall not be removed from registration review if, in the commissioner's\njudgment, conditions that may contribute to a poor learning environment, as\nidentified in paragraph (9) of this subdivision, remain present in the\nschool. (ii)\n\nIn the event that a\nschool placed under registration review prior to the 2010-2011 school year\ndemonstrates previously established progress to be removed from registration\nreview, but is identified in the 2010-2011 school year as persistently\nlowest-achieving pursuant to subparagraph (9)(ii) of this subdivision, the\nschool shall remain under registration review and shall follow intervention\nrequirements pursuant to subparagraph (10)(iv) of this subdivision. (iii)\n\nIn the event that a school placed under\nregistration review prior to the 2010-2011 school year demonstrates previously\nestablished progress to be removed from registration review and is not\nidentified in the 2010-2011 school year as persistently lowest-achieving\npursuant to subparagraph (9)(ii) of this subdivision, the school shall be\nremoved from registration review. (iv)\n\nIn the event that a board of education\nseeks to phase out or close a school under registration review, the board of\neducation (in New York City, the chancellor or chancellor's designee) shall\nsubmit for commissioner's approval, a plan identifying the intervention that\nwill be implemented and will result in phase out or closure. The commissioner\nmay grant approval of such plan provided that: (a) official resolutions or other approvals\nto phase out or close the existing school have been adopted by the local board\nof education (in New York City, the chancellor or chancellor's\ndesignee); (b) a formal phase out\nor closure plan has been developed and approved in accordance with the\nrequirements of the intervention prescribed by the commissioner pursuant to\nsubparagraph (10)(iv) of this subdivision; and\n(c) parents, teachers, administrators, and\ncommunity members have been provided an opportunity to participate in the\ndevelopment of the phase out or closure plan. (12)\n\nRegistered nonpublic high school\nregistration review. (i) The registration of\na registered nonpublic high school shall be placed under review under the\nfollowing circumstances: (a) when the school\nscores below the registration review criterion on one (or more) of the measures\nadopted by the Board of Regents, and the student achievement on such measures\nor other appropriate indicators has not shown improvement over the preceding\nthree school years, as determined by the commissioner; or\n(b) when sufficient other reason exists, as\ndetermined by the commissioner, to warrant a review of the school's\nregistration. (ii)\n\nOn an\nongoing basis consistent with clauses (i)(\na\n) and\n(\nb\n) of this paragraph, and after consultation with the\nappropriate nonpublic school officials, the commissioner shall identify the\nnonpublic high schools whose registration shall be placed under review.

(i) All public elementary, intermediate, middle, junior high schools, and high schools, other than charter schools, in existence on September 1, 2002 shall be deemed registered by the Board of\n\nRegents\npursuant to this subdivision as of such date. (ii)\nA school district that seeks to register a public elementary, intermediate, middle, junior high school or high school which is not registered pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall submit a petition for registration to the Board of\n\nRegents, in a form prescribed by the commissioner and containing such information as the commissioner may require, no later than June 15th for schools opening in September of the next successive school year or, for those schools opening during a current school year, at least 90 days prior the opening of such school, except that the commissioner may waive this timeline for good cause. The commissioner shall review the petition and shall recommend its\napproval\nto the Board of\n\nRegents\nif it is satisfactorily demonstrated that the district has provided an assurance that the school will be operated in an educationally sound manner; is in compliance with applicable statutes, rules and regulations relating to public schools; and will operate in accordance with applicable building codes and pursuant to a certificate of occupancy. No new public school will be recommended for registration by the commissioner if, in the commissioner's judgment, the establishment of such school would conflict with an\napproved\nplan for district reorganization, except where it can be established to the satisfaction of the commissioner that such school is essential to the education welfare of the students. (a) Where a school registered pursuant to this paragraph is in a district in which one or more schools have been designated as a school in improvement, corrective action or restructuring, the commissioner shall determine the accountability status of the newly registered school based upon his review of the proposed educational program, including but not limited to such factors as: school mission, school administration and staff, grade configurations and groupings of students, zoning patterns, curricula and instruction and facilities. (b) In the event that a school district merges two or more schools or transfers organizational responsibility for one or more grades from one school to another, the commissioner may adjust the accountability status of the affected schools to reflect such organizational changes. (3)\n\nAll registrations\napproved\nby the Board of\n\nRegents\npursuant to this subdivision shall continue in effect unless revoked by the Board of\n\nRegents\nupon recommendation of the commissioner after review of the registration, or the school district closes the school. (4)\n\nSystem of accountability for student success. Each year, commencing with 2002-2003 school year test administration results, the commissioner shall review the performance of all public schools, charter schools and school districts in the State. For each accountability performance criterion specified in paragraph (14) and each performance indicator specified in paragraph (15) of this subdivision, the commissioner, commencing with 2002-2003 school year test administration results, shall determine whether each public school, charter school and school district has achieved adequate yearly progress as set forth in paragraph (5) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nAdequate yearly progress. (i) A public school, charter school or school district shall be deemed to have made adequate yearly progress on an accountability performance criterion set forth in paragraph (14) of this subdivision if each accountability group within such school or district achieved adequate yearly progress on that criterion. (ii)\n\nIn public schools, charter schools or school districts with fewer than 30 students subject to an accountability performance criterion set forth in paragraphs (14) and (15) of this subdivision, the commissioner shall use the weighted average of the current and prior school year's performance data for that criterion in order to make a determination of adequate yearly progress. No public school, charter school or school district will be held accountable for any other accountability group consisting of fewer than 30 students as long as the \"all student\" accountability group includes at least 30 students for that school year. (iii)\n\nFor purposes of determining adequate yearly progress, only the performance of continuously enrolled students in grades 3-8 shall be included for consideration. (iv)\n\nAn accountability group shall be deemed to have made adequate yearly progress on an accountability performance criterion specified in paragraph (14) of this subdivision if: (a) the superintendent of the school district or the principal of the charter school has submitted the required student data files to the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (bb)(2) of this section or section\n119.3\n(b) of this Title in the timeframe and format specified by the commissioner; and\n(b) for accountability groups consisting of 40 or more students, either: (1)\nthe participation rate for the current year equals or exceeds 95 percent; or\n(2)\nthe weighted average of the current year and prior year participation rates equals or exceeds 95 percent; (c) for accountability groups consisting of 30 or more students: (1)\nthe accountability group met or exceeded, or did not differ significantly as determined by the commissioner, from the annual measurable objective for that criterion; or\n(2)\nthe accountability group met or exceeded, or did not differ significantly as determined by the commissioner, from an annual performance target established by the commissioner and the accountability group met or exceeded the third performance indicator at that grade level, as defined in paragraph (15) of this subdivision. (v) A public school, charter school or school district shall be deemed to have made adequate yearly progress on a performance indicator specified in paragraph (15) of this subdivision if: (a) the superintendent of the school district or the principal of the charter school has submitted the required student data files to the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (bb)(2) of this section or section\n119.3\n(b) of this Title in the timeframe and format specified by the commissioner; and\n(b) the \"all students\" accountability group in the school or school district at the applicable grade levels or high school cohort met or exceeded the performance indicator and, for elementary and middle levels, and beginning in 2005-2006 for the elementary-middle level, 80 percent of students enrolled on all days of the science test administration, who did not have a significant medical emergency, received valid scores. (vi)\n\nFor each school year, public schools, school districts, and charter schools in which no students or, pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph fewer than 30 students, participate in the required State assessments for English language arts or mathematics, or in which the majority of students are not continuously enrolled, shall conduct a self-assessment of their academic program and the school learning environment, in such format and using such criteria as may be prescribed by the commissioner. Such self-assessment shall not be required of those schools and school districts for which the commissioner shall conduct a review of the performance of the school or school district in accordance with subparagraph (viii) of this paragraph. The superintendent of the school district or principal of the charter school shall review the self-assessment(s) and make a recommendation to the commissioner, in such format and according to such timeframe as the commissioner may prescribe, as to whether the school or school district has made adequate yearly progress. The commissioner shall consider the self-assessment, board recommendation and any other relevant information in determining whether the school or school district made adequate yearly progress. (vii)\n\nThe school accountability status of public schools, school districts, and charter schools serving grades 1 and/or 2, but not grade 3 or higher, (hereafter referred to as \"feeder schools\") will be determined using backmapping. In school districts with such feeder schools and in school districts that accept grade 3 students from feeder schools by contract, the grade three State assessment results for each feeder school student will be attributed to the feeder school as well as to the school or charter school in which the student took the assessment. The student's results will be attributed to a feeder school only if the student was continuously enrolled in the feeder school from the date prescribed by the commissioner on which the BEDS forms are required to be completed until the end of the school year in the highest grade served by the feeder school. In a district, if all schools serving grade three make adequate yearly progress in a given year, all feeder schools served by the district will be deemed to have made adequate yearly progress. If one or more schools enrolling students from a feeder school fail to make adequate yearly progress on a criterion set forth at subparagraphs (14)(iii) and (vi) of this subdivision, the commissioner will aggregate the district's grade three results on that criterion by feeder school and determine whether each feeder school made adequate yearly progress on that criterion. If a feeder school fails to make adequate yearly progress on the same criterion for two consecutive years, the school will be designated as a school in improvement (year 1). (6)\n\nDifferentiated accountability for schools. (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, beginning with the 2009-2010 school year and thereafter, public schools, and charter schools that receive funds under title I, that failed to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) pursuant to this subparagraph shall be designated into accountability phases and phase categories as follows: (a) Accountability phases. (1)\n\nImprovement phase. (i) A school that fails to make AYP for two consecutive years on the same accountability performance criterion in paragraph (14) of this subdivision or the same accountability indicator in paragraph (15) of this subdivision shall be designated in the next school year as a school in improvement (year 1) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator. (ii)\nA school that is designated as a school in improvement (year 1) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in improvement (year 2) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator. (2)\n\nCorrective action phase. (i) A school that is designated as a school in improvement (year 2) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified as a school in improvement (year 2) shall be designated in the next school year as a school in corrective action (year 1) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator. (ii)\nA school that is designated as a school in corrective action (year 1) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in corrective action (year 2) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator. (3)\n\nRestructuring phase. (i) A school that is designated as a school in corrective action (year 2) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in restructuring (year 1) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator. (ii)\nA school that is designated as a school in restructuring (year 1) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in restructuring (year 2) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator. (iii)\nA school that is designated as a school in restructuring (year 2) that fails to make AYP on the same accountability performance criterion or accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be designated in the next school year as a school in restructuring (advanced) for that accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator. (b) Phase categories. (1)\n\nImprovement phase. Schools designated in improvement shall be assigned to a category upon entry into the phase as follows: (i) Basic: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for one accountability group within one accountability performance criterion, but not the all students group; or\n(B)\nschools that fail to make AYP for one of the accountability indicators, but met the accountability performance criterion. (ii)\n\nFocused: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for more than one accountability performance criterion, but not the all students group; or\n(B)\nschools that fail to make AYP for more than one accountability student group within an accountability performance criterion, but not the all students group. (iii)\n\nComprehensive: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for the all students group on any accountability performance criterion; or\n(B)\nschools that fail to make AYP for every accountability group, except the all students group, within an accountability criterion for which there are at least two accountability groups other than the all students group; or\n(C)\nschools that fail to make AYP for an accountability performance criterion and for an indicator. (2)\n\nCorrective action or restructuring phase. Schools designated in corrective action or restructuring shall be assigned to a category upon entry into the phase as follows: (i) Focused: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for one of the accountability indicators, but met the accountability performance criterion; or\n(B)\nschools that fail to make AYP for more than one accountability performance criterion, but not with the all students group; or\n(C)\nschools that fail to make AYP for one or more accountability groups within an accountability performance criterion, but not the all students group. (ii)\n\nComprehensive: (A)\nschools that fail to make AYP for the all students group on any accountability performance criterion; or\n(B)\nschools that fail to make AYP for every accountability group, except the all students group, within an accountability performance criterion for which there are at least two accountability groups other than the all students group; or\n(C)\nschools that fail to make AYP for an accountability performance criterion and for an accountability indicator. (c) The commissioner shall designate a school's overall accountability status as the most advanced phase for which it has been identified on an accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator and, within that designated phase, shall assign the highest category, provided that such category may not be reduced in a subsequent year of a phase. (d) Upon a finding of exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, the commissioner may delay for a period of one year the designation of a school under this paragraph. (ii)\n\nSpecial transition provisions for schools in operation during the 2008-2009 school year and for schools under registration review. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph: (a) for each public school that was in operation during the 2008-2009 school year and for each charter school that was in operation and received funds under title I during the 2008-2009 school year, the commissioner shall designate the school's accountability phase and phase category for the 2009-2010 school year, based upon the school's accountability status for the 2008-2009 school year and the school's adequate yearly progress (AYP) status for the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 school years; (b) notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) of this subparagraph, a school that is identified for registration review pursuant to paragraph (9) of this subdivision during a school year in which it is designated as a school in improvement or corrective action shall, in the next school year, be designated as a school in restructuring (year 1)/comprehensive and shall be subject to the requirements of subclause (iv)(\nc\n)(\n2\n) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nRemoval from accountability designation. A school that makes adequate yearly progress for two consecutive years on the accountability performance criterion/accountability indicator for which it has been identified shall be removed from accountability designation for that accountability performance criterion and/or accountability indicator. (iv)\n\nInterventions. (a) Improvement phase schools. (1)\n\nSchool quality review. Each school upon initial designation for the improvement phase shall participate in a school quality review, to include at a minimum a self-assessment of the educational program, using quality indicators in a form and content prescribed by the commissioner. The school quality review shall focus on the accountability group(s) for each accountability performance criterion and/or accountability indicator for which the school has been identified. (2)\n\nSchool improvement plan. A school improvement plan, in such format as may be prescribed by the commissioner, shall be developed based on the school quality review and cover a two year period. The plan shall: (i) be formally\napproved\nby the board of education (in New York City, approved\nby the chancellor or chancellor's designee) no later than three months following the designation of the school in the improvement phase and shall be subject to the\napproval\nof the commissioner, upon request; (ii)\nbe implemented no later than the beginning of the next school year after the school year in which the school was identified or immediately upon\napproval\nof the board of education if such\napproval\noccurs after the first day of regular school attendance; (iii)\nbe updated annually and, as so updated, approved\nby the board of education and implemented no later than the first day of regular student attendance of each year that the school remains in improvement. If, in the second year of improvement, the school fails to make AYP with a different accountability group for which the school is subsequently designated for improvement or is subsequently designated for improvement for a different accountability performance criterion or indicator, the school shall modify the plan consistent with the highest accountability category and also address the additional group(s), criterion or indicator; (iv)\nfor a school designated as improvement/basic, the plan shall also include a description of activities and timeline for implementation. The district shall be responsible for oversight and support of the plan; (v) for a school designated as improvement/focused, the plan shall, consistent with State law, also include one or more of the actions set forth in section 6316 (b)(3)(A)(i-x) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section\n6316(b)(3)(A)(i-x)\n(\nUnited States Code, 2006 Edition, Volume 13; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-0001; 2008; available at the Office of Counsel, State Education Building, Room 148, Albany, NY 12234), in accordance with a written report by the school quality review team; and\n(vi)\nfor a school designated as improvement/comprehensive, the plan shall, consistent with State law, also include all of the actions set forth in section 6316 (b)(3)(A)(i-x) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section\n6316(b)(3)(A)(i-x)\n(\nUnited States Code, 2006 Edition, Volume 13; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-0001; 2008; available at the Office of Counsel, State Education Building, Room 148, Albany, NY 12234), in accordance with a written report by the school quality review team.

Except as provided in paragraph (9) of this subdivision, in addition to the school quality review and prior to the development of the school improvement plan required under clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph: (i) for a school designated as improvement/focused, the school shall be required to participate in an on-site review that shall be conducted by a school quality review team, with district representation, appointed by the commissioner. The review shall focus on the accountability group(s), accountability performance criterion and/or indicator for which the school was identified. The district shall be responsible for oversight and support of the plan; (ii)\nfor a school designated as improvement/comprehensive, the school shall be required to participate in an intensive on-site review that shall be conducted by a school quality review team, with district representation, appointed by the commissioner. The review shall focus on the systemic issues at the school that have caused the school to be designated for improvement. The district shall be responsible for oversight and support of the plan. (b) Corrective action phase schools. (1)\n\nCurriculum audit. Except as provided in paragraph (9) of this subdivision, each school, upon initial designation for the corrective action phase, shall participate in a curriculum audit to assess the school's educational program. The curriculum audit shall be in a form and content prescribed by the commissioner and shall focus on the accountability group(s) for each accountability performance criterion and/or accountability indicator for which the school was identified. The school shall be assisted by a school quality review team, with district representation, appointed by the commissioner. (2)\n\nCorrective action plan. A corrective action plan, in such format as may be prescribed by the commissioner, shall be developed and cover a two-year period. The district and school quality review team shall provide oversight and support for implementation of a corrective action plan. The plan shall: (i) be formally\napproved\nby the board of education (in New York City, approved\nby the chancellor or chancellor's designee) no later than three months following the designation of the school in the corrective action phase and shall be subject to the\napproval\nof the commissioner, upon request; (ii)\nbe implemented no later than the beginning of the next school year after the school year in which the school was identified or immediately upon\napproval\nof the board of education if such\napproval\noccurs after the first day of regular school attendance; (iii)\nbe updated annually and incorporate the findings of the audit and any other action required to be taken by the district pursuant to this subclause and, as so updated, approved\nby the board of education and implemented no later than the first day of regular student attendance of each year that the school remains in corrective action. If, in the second year of corrective action, the school fails to make AYP with a different accountability group for which the school is subsequently designated for corrective action or is subsequently designated for corrective action on a different accountability performance criterion or indicator, the school shall modify the plan consistent with the highest accountability category and also address the additional group(s), criterion or indicator; (iv)\ninclude, to the extent consistent with State law, at least one of the actions set forth at section 6316(b)(7)(C)(iv)(I-VI) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section\n6316(b)(7)(C)(iv)\n(I-VI) (\nUnited States Code, 2006 Edition, Volume 13; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-0001; 2008; available at the Office of Counsel, State Education Building, Room 148, Albany, NY 12234). The district shall identify and provide the support(s) required to implement any new curriculum, including professional development; (c) Restructuring phase schools. (1)\n\nAssessment of educational program. Each school shall participate in an assessment of the educational program by a joint intervention team appointed by the commissioner which shall include district representation and may include a distinguished educator. The team shall assess the educational program and make recommendations. (2)\n\nRestructuring plan. A two year restructuring plan shall be developed and implemented by the district, focusing on the subgroup(s) for the accountability performance criterion and/or accountability indicator for which the school was identified. The district shall provide oversight and support for the plan, with the assistance of the\ndepartment. Such restructuring plan shall require the school to make fundamental reforms, such as significant changes in the staff, governance, or organization and may include a plan to close or phase out the school, and shall: (i) be formally\napproved\nby the board of education (in New York City, approved\nby the chancellor or chancellor's designee) no later than three months following the designation of the school in the restructuring phase and also shall be subject to the\napproval\nof the commissioner; and\n(ii)\nbe implemented no later than the beginning of the next school year after the school year in which the school was identified or, to the extent practicable, immediately upon\napproval\nof the board of education if such\napproval\noccurs after the first day of regular school attendance. (3)\n\nDistinguished educator. In addition to, and notwithstanding the provisions of, subclauses (\n1\n) and (\n2\n) of this clause, a school designated as restructuring/comprehensive shall cooperate with a distinguished educator assigned by the commissioner. The distinguished educator shall also provide oversight of the restructuring plan and shall serve as an ex-officio member of the board of education. All plans are subject to review by the distinguished educator who shall make recommendations to the board of education.

(7)\n\nDistricts requiring academic progress. (i) Commencing with 2003-2004 school year results, a district that failed to make adequate yearly progress on all applicable criteria in paragraph (14) of this subdivision in a subject area, or all applicable indicators in subparagraphs (15)(i) through (iii) of this subdivision, or the indicator in subparagraph (15)(iv) of this subdivision, for two consecutive years shall be designated as a \"district requiring academic progress.\" A district improvement plan in such format as may be prescribed by the commissioner shall be developed by each district requiring academic progress. Such district improvement plan shall be formally\napproved\nby the board of education (in New York City, both the New York City Board of Education and the community school board for schools under the jurisdiction of the community school district) no later than three months following the identification of the district as requiring academic progress and submitted to the commissioner for\napproval. The plan shall be implemented no later than beginning of the next school year after the school year in which the school district was identified as requiring academic progress or immediately, to the extent practicable, upon\napproval\nof the board, if such identification occurs after the first day of regular student attendance. Such plan shall be developed in consultation with parents, school, staff, and others. The plan shall be revised annually and resubmitted to the commissioner for\napproval\nno later than July 31st of each school year in which the district remains identified as requiring academic progress. Any modification of the district's\napproved\nimprovement plan shall require the prior\napproval\nof the commissioner. (ii)\n\nCommencing with 2003-2004 school year results: (a) a district identified as requiring academic progress for failing to make adequate yearly progress on all applicable criterion in paragraph (14) of this subdivision in a subject area shall be removed from such status if it makes adequate yearly progress for two consecutive years on any criterion in the subject area for which it is identified; (b) a district identified as requiring academic progress for failing to make adequate yearly progress on every applicable indicator set forth at subparagraphs (15)(i) through (iii) of this subdivision shall be removed from such status if it makes adequate yearly progress for two consecutive years on any applicable indicators; and\n(c) a district identified as requiring academic progress for failing to make adequate yearly progress on the indicator set forth at subparagraph (15)(iv) of this subdivision shall be removed from such status if it makes adequate yearly progress for two consecutive years on such indicator; provided that for a district requiring academic progress that is removed from such status based on 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 results, such district shall have made adequate yearly progress in 2002-2003 on each criterion or indicator for which it was identified. (iii)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph, a local educational agency (LEA) that received funds under title I for two consecutive years during which the LEA did not make adequate yearly progress on all applicable criteria in paragraph (14) of this subdivision in a subject area, or all applicable indicators in subparagraphs (15)(i) through (iii) of this subdivision, or the indicator in subparagraph (15)(iv) of this subdivision, shall be identified for improvement under section 1116(c) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section\n6316(c)\nand shall be subject to the requirements therein (Public Law, section 107-110, section 1116[c], 115 STAT. 1487-1491; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9328; 2002; available at the Office of Counsel, State Education Building, Room 148, Albany, NY 12234). (iv)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph, at any time following the identification of an LEA for improvement, the commissioner may further identify the local educational agency for corrective action under section 1116(c)(10) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section\n6316(c)(10). The commissioner shall identify such LEA for corrective action if, by the end of the second full school year the LEA has failed to make adequate yearly progress. The commissioner may delay identification of an LEA for corrective action for a period of one year pursuant to section 1116(c)(10)(F) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section\n6316(c)(10)(F)\n(Public Law, section 107-110, section 1116[c][10], 115 STAT. 1489-1491; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9328; 2002; available at the Office of Counsel, State Education Building, Room 148, Albany, NY 12234). (v) Commencing with 2003-2004 school year results, an LEA identified for improvement or corrective action that is removed from status as a district requiring academic progress pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph shall no longer be subject to the requirements of section 1116(c) of the NCLB, 20 U.S.C. section\n6316(c)\n(Public Law, section 107-110, section 1116[c], 115 STAT. 1487-1491; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9328; 2002; available at the Office of Counsel, State Education Building, Room 148, Albany, NY 12234). (vi)\n\nNot withstanding any other provision of law, an LEA subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph which accountability status is dependent upon the 2005-2006 assessment results for grades 3-8 and which does not receive notice of such status until after the first day of regular attendance for the 2006-2007 school year, shall immediately commence implementation, to the extent practicable, of any plan required to be implemented pursuant to section 1116(c) of the NCLB. (8)\n\nHigh performing and rapidly improving schools and districts. (i) Commencing with 2003-2004 school year results, the commissioner shall annually identify as \"high performing\" public schools, school districts, and charter schools in which: (a) the school or district meets or exceeds the benchmarks established by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (14)(ix) of this subdivision; and\n(b) the school or district has made adequate yearly progress on all applicable criteria and indicators in paragraphs (14) and (15) of this subdivision for two consecutive years. (ii)\n\nCommencing with 2004-2005 school year results, the commissioner shall annually identify as \"rapidly improving\" public schools, school districts, and charter schools in which: (a) the school or district is below the benchmark established by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (14)(ix) of this subdivision; (b) the school or district has improved its performance by an amount determined by the commissioner during the past three years on each applicable criterion in paragraph (14) of this subdivision in which it is below the benchmark established by the commissioner; and\n(c) the school or district has made adequate yearly progress on all applicable criteria and indicators in paragraphs (14) and (15) of this subdivision for three consecutive years. (iii)\n\nThe commissioner may elect not to identify a school or district as high performing or rapidly improving if the school or district is held accountable for the performance of three or fewer accountability groups on each applicable criterion. (9)\n\nIdentification of schools for public school registration review. (i) Up through and including the 2009-2010 school year, the commissioner shall place under registration review those schools that are determined to be farthest from meeting the benchmarks established by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (14)(ix) of this subdivision and most in need of improvement. (ii)\n\nBeginning with the 2010-2011 school year and thereafter, the commissioner shall place under preliminary registration review a school that is identified as persistently lowest-achieving in such school year. A school identified as persistently lowest-achieving in the 2009-2010 school year, that was not a school under registration review during the 2009-2010 school year, shall not be placed under registration review but shall follow the intervention and other applicable requirements in subparagraphs (10)(ii) and (iv) of this subdivision. (a) A school shall be identified as persistently lowest-achieving if, based upon the academic indicators set forth in clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, it is: (1)\na Title I school in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring that: (i) is among the lowest-achieving five percent of Title I schools in improvement, corrective action or restructuring, or the lowest achieving five Title I schools in improvement, corrective action or restructuring, whichever number of schools is greater; or\n(ii)\nis a high school that has a graduation rate, as defined in subparagraph (15)(iv) of this subdivision, that is less than 60 percent over the three consecutive year period for which accountability determinations have been made pursuant to this subdivision; or\n(2)\na\nsecondary school\nthat is eligible for, but does not receive, Title I funds that: (i) is among the lowest-achieving five percent of secondary schools or the lowest-achieving five secondary schools in the State that are eligible for, but do not receive, Title I funds, whichever number of schools is greater; or\n(ii)\nis a high school that has a graduation rate, as defined in subparagraph (15)(iv) of this subdivision, that is less than 60 percent over the three consecutive year period for which accountability determinations have been made. (b) A school shall be identified as persistently lowest-achieving based on the following academic indicators: (1)\nthe performance of the school's \"all students\" group on the State assessments in English language arts and mathematics combined, which shall be determined by dividing the sum of the \"all students\" performance index for each English language arts and mathematics measure for which the school is accountable by the number of measures for which the school is accountable; and\n(2)\nthe school's lack of progress on the State assessments in English language arts and mathematics over three years. A school shall be deemed to have demonstrated lack of progress if: (i) the school is designated as a school in restructuring; and\n(ii)\nthe school has failed to demonstrate, over the three consecutive year period for which accountability determinations have been made pursuant to this subdivision, at least a 25 point gain in its performance index for the \"all students\" group in each English language arts and mathematics measure for which the school is held accountable; and/or\n(3)\nthe school has a graduation rate, as defined in subparagraph (15)(iv) of this subdivision, that is less than 60 percent over the three consecutive year period for which accountability determinations have been made pursuant to this subdivision. (iii)\n\nThe commissioner shall also place under preliminary registration review a school that is not otherwise eligible to be identified as persistently lowest-achieving that meets the academic indicators in clause (ii)(\nb\n) of this paragraph to be identified as a persistently lowest-achieving school: (a) is a school in which more than 50 percent of the total student enrollment consists of students with disabilities; or\n(b) is a non-Title I elementary school or a non-Title I eligible\nsecondary school. (iv)\n\nThe commissioner may also place under preliminary registration review any school that has conditions that threaten the health, safety and/or educational welfare of students or has been the subject of persistent complaints to the\ndepartment\nby parents or persons in parental relation to the student, and has been identified by the commissioner as a poor learning environment based upon a combination of factors affecting student learning, including but not limited to: high rates of student absenteeism, high levels of school violence, excessive rates of student suspensions, violation of applicable building health and safety standards, high rates of teacher and administrator turnover, excessive rates of referral of students to or participation in special education or excessive rates of participation of students with disabilities in the alternate assessment, excessive transfers of students to alternative high school and high school equivalency programs and excessive use of uncertified teachers or teachers in subject areas other than those for which they possess certification. (v) The commissioner may also place under registration review any school for which a district fails to provide in a timely manner the student performance data required by the commissioner to conduct the annual assessment of the school's performance or any school in which excessive percentages of students fail to fully participate in the State assessment program. (vi)\n\nBeginning in the 2010-2011 school year, for each school identified for preliminary registration review pursuant to subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, the local school district shall be given the opportunity to present to the commissioner additional assessment data, which may include, but need not be limited to, valid and reliable measures of: the performance of students in grades other than those in which the State tests are administered; the performance of limited English proficient students and/or other students with special needs; and the progress that specific grades have made or that cohorts of students in the school have made towards demonstrating higher student performance. For each school identified as a poor learning environment and placed under preliminary registration review pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, the district shall be given the opportunity to present evidence to the commissioner that the conditions in the school do not threaten the health or safety or educational welfare of students and do not adversely affect student performance. The district may also provide relevant information concerning extraordinary, temporary circumstances faced by the school that may have affected the performance of students in the school on the State tests. (vii)\n\nThe commissioner shall review the additional information provided by the district and determine which of the schools identified for preliminary registration review pursuant to subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, or identified as poor learning environments pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, shall be placed under registration review. (viii)\n\nIn determining the number of schools to place under registration review, other than persistently lowest-achieving schools identified pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the commissioner may consider the sufficiency of State and local resources to effectively implement and monitor school improvement efforts in schools under registration review. (ix)\n\nFor schools required to conduct a self-assessment pursuant to subparagraph (5)(vi) of this subdivision, the commissioner upon review of the self-assessment may make a determination that the school shall be placed under registration review. (10)\n\nPublic school registration review. (i) Upon placing the registration of a school under review, the commissioner shall warn the board of education (in New York City, the chancellor) that the school has been placed under registration review, and that the school is at risk of having its registration revoked. The commissioner shall include in any warning issued pursuant to this subparagraph an explicit delineation of the progress that must be demonstrated in order for a school to be removed from consideration for revocation of registration. Upon receipt of such warning, the board of education (in New York City, the chancellor or chancellor's designee) shall take appropriate action to notify the general public of the issuance of such warning. Such action shall include, but need not be limited to, direct notification, within 30 days of receipt of the commissioner's warning, in English and translated, when appropriate, into the recipient's native language or mode of communication, to persons in parental relation of children attending the school that it has been placed under registration review and is at risk of having its registration revoked, and disclosure by the district at the next public meeting of the local board of education of such warning. Each school year during which a school remains under registration review, by June 30th or at the time of a student's initial application or\nadmission\nto the school, whichever is earliest, the board of education shall provide direct notification to parents or other persons in parental relation to children attending the school that the school remains under registration review and is at risk of having its registration revoked. Such notification shall include a summary of the actions that the district and school are taking to improve student results and an explanation of any district programs of choice, magnet programs, transfer policies, or other options that a parent or a person in parental relation may have to place the child in a different public school within the district. Such notification shall include the timelines and process for parents exercising their rights to school choice. (ii)\n\nFollowing the placement of a school under registration review, or following the identification of a school as persistently lowest-achieving in the 2009-2010 school year, a joint intervention team, as appointed by the commissioner, shall assist the school district in which such school is located in selecting an intervention pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. The district shall develop a new restructuring plan, or update an existing restructuring plan, that shall, in addition to the requirements pursuant to subclause (6)(iv)(\nc\n)(\n2\n) of this subdivision, describe the implementation of the intervention. Such plan shall be in a format as prescribed by the commissioner. The district shall update the plan annually for implementation no later than the first day of the regular student attendance of each school year that the designation continues. The school shall implement the intervention in accordance with a timeline prescribed by the commissioner, and no later than the beginning of the next school year following the school's identification for registration review, provided that the commissioner may upon a finding of good cause extend the timeline for implementing elements of such plan beyond the date prescribed therein. (iii)\n\nSchools placed under registration review pursuant to subparagraph (9)(i) of this subdivision, but not identified pursuant to subparagraph (9)(ii) of this subdivision as persistently lowest-achieving prior to the 2010-2011 school year, shall continue implementation of the existing restructuring plan. (iv)\n\nInterventions. (a) A school that is identified pursuant to subparagraph (9)(ii) of this subdivision as persistently lowest-achieving in the 2010-2011 school year or thereafter and placed under registration review, and a school that is identified pursuant to subparagraph (9)(ii) of this subdivision as persistently lowest-achieving in the 2009-2010 school year, shall implement one of the following interventions, in a format and timeline as\napproved\nby the commissioner: (1)\n\nTurnaround model. Implementation of the turnaround model may include, but not be limited to, the following actions as\napproved\nby the commissioner: (i) replace the principal and grant the principal sufficient operational flexibility (including in staffing, calendars/time, and budgeting) to implement fully a comprehensive approach in order to substantially improve student achievement outcomes and increase high school graduation rates; (ii)\nusing locally adopted competencies to measure the effectiveness of staff that shall work within the turnaround environment to meet the needs of students: (A)\nscreen all existing staff and rehire no more than 50 percent; and\n(B)\nselect new staff; (iii)\nimplement such strategies as financial incentives, increased opportunities for promotion and career growth, and more flexible work conditions that shall be designed to recruit, place, and retain staff with the skills necessary to meet the needs of students in the turnaround school; (iv)\nprovide staff ongoing, high-quality, job-embedded professional learning that is aligned with the school's comprehensive instructional program and designed with school staff to ensure that they are equipped to facilitate effective teaching and learning and have the capacity to successfully implement school reform strategies; (v) adopt a new governance structure, which may include, but is not limited to, requiring the school to report to a new turnaround office in the LEA or SEA, hire a turnaround leader who reports directly to the superintendent or chief academic officer, or enter into a multi-year contract with the LEA or SEA to obtain added flexibility in exchange for greater accountability; (vi)\nuse data to identify and implement an instructional program that is research-based and vertically aligned from one grade to the next as well as aligned with State academic standards; (vii)\npromote the continuous use of student data (such as from formative, interim, and summative assessments) that shall inform and differentiate instruction in order to meet the academic needs of individual students; (viii)\nestablish schedules and implement strategies that shall provide increased learning time, as defined by the commissioner; and\n(ix)\nprovide appropriate social-emotional and community-oriented services and supports for students. (2)\n\nRestart model. Implementation of the restart model may include, but is not limited to, converting a school or closing and reopening a school under a charter school operator, a charter management organization, or an educational partnership organization that has been selected pursuant to a format\napproved\nby the commissioner. (3)\n\nSchool closure model. Implementation of the school closure model may include, but is not limited to, closing a school and enrolling its students in other schools within the district that are in good standing. (4)\n\nTransformation model. Implementation of the transformation model may include, but is not limited to, the following actions as\napproved\nby the commissioner; in addition, the school shall be encouraged to partner with an external intermediary or lead partner that may assist the school with planning and implementation: (i) develop and increase teacher and school leader effectiveness; (ii)\nreplace the principal who led the school prior to commencement of the transformation model; (iii)\nuse rigorous, transparent, and equitable evaluation systems for teachers and principals that: (A)\ntake into account data on student growth as a significant factor as well as other factors, such as multiple observation-based assessments of performance and ongoing collections of professional practice reflective of student achievement and increased high school graduation rates; and\n(B)\nare designed and developed with teacher and principal involvement; (iv)\nidentify and reward school leaders, teachers, and other staff who, through implementation of the transformation model, have increased student achievement and high school graduation rates, per rates defined by the commissioner; and identify and remove those who, after ample opportunities have been provided for them to improve their professional practice, have not done so; (v) provide staff ongoing, high-quality job-embedded professional learning (\ne.g., regarding subject-specific pedagogy, instruction that reflects a deeper understanding of the community served by the school or differentiated instruction) that is aligned with the school's comprehensive instructional program and designed with school staff to ensure they are equipped to facilitate effective teaching and learning and have the capacity to successfully implement school reform strategies; (vi)\nimplement such strategies as financial incentives, increased opportunities for promotion and career growth, and more flexible work conditions that shall be designed to recruit, place and retain staff with the skills necessary to meet the needs of the students in a transformation school; (vii)\nuse data to identify and implement an instructional program that is research-based and vertically aligned from one grade to the next as well as aligned with State academic standards; (viii)\npromote the continuous use of student data (such as from formative, interim and summative assessments) to inform and differentiate instruction in order to meet the academic needs of individual students; (ix)\nestablish schedules and strategies that provide increased learning time; (x) provide ongoing mechanisms for family and community engagement; (xi)\ngive the school sufficient operational flexibility (such as staffing, calendars/time, and budgeting) to implement fully a comprehensive approach to substantially improve student achievement outcomes and increase high school graduation rates; and\n(xii)\nensure that the school receives ongoing, intensive technical assistance and related support for the LEA, the SEA or a designated external lead partner organization. (b) A school as described in subparagraph (9)(iii) of this subdivision that is placed under registration review in the 2010-2011 school year or thereafter, shall implement a plan, in a format and timeline as\napproved\nby the commissioner, that shall, at a minimum, meet the requirements of a restructuring plan pursuant to subclause (6)(iv)(\nc\n)(\n2\n) of this subdivision and include at least one of the actions of a transformation or turnaround model. (v) The\ndepartment\nshall periodically monitor the implementation of the restructuring plan. The commissioner may require a school district to submit such reports and data as the commissioner deems necessary to monitor the implementation of the restructuring plan and to determine the degree to which the school has achieved the progress required by the commissioner. Such reports shall be in a format and in accordance with such timeframe as are prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner may upon a finding of good cause extend the deadline for submission of a restructuring plan. (vi)\n\nUnless it is determined by the commissioner that a school identified for registration review should be phased out or closed, or that a shorter period of time shall be granted, a school placed under registration review shall be given three full academic years to show progress. If, after three full academic years of implementing a restructuring plan, the school has not demonstrated progress as delineated by the commissioner in the warning pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the commissioner shall recommend to the Board of\n\nRegents\nthat the registration be revoked and the school be declared an unsound educational environment, except that the commissioner may upon a finding of extenuating circumstances extend the period during which the school must demonstrate progress. The board of education of the school district which operates the school (in New York City, the chancellor) shall be afforded notice of such recommendation and an opportunity to be heard in accordance with subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. Upon\napproval\nof revocation of registration by the Board of\n\nRegents, the commissioner will develop a plan to ensure that the educational welfare of the pupils of the school is protected. Such plan shall specify the instructional program into which pupils who had attended the school will be placed, how their participation in the specified programs will be funded, and the measures that will be taken to ensure that the selected placements appropriately meet the educational needs of the pupils. The commissioner shall require the board of education to implement such plan. (vii)\n\nDecisions to revoke the registration of a public school shall be made in accordance with the following procedures: (a) The commissioner shall provide written notice of his recommendation and the reasons therefor to the board of education, which operates the school (in New York City, both the New York City Board of Education and any community school board having jurisdiction over the school). Such notice shall also set forth: (1)\nthe board of education's right to submit a response to the recommendation and request oral argument pursuant to clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph; (2)\nthe place, date and time the matter will be reviewed and if requested, argument heard by a three-member panel of the Board of\n\nRegents\nfor recommendation to the full Board of\n\nRegents; and\n(3)\nnotification that failure to submit a response will result in the commissioner's recommendation being submitted to the Board of\n\nRegents\nfor determination. (b) Within 15 days of receiving notice of the recommendation to revoke registration, the board of education may submit a written response to the commissioner's recommendation. The response shall be in the form of a written statement which presents the board of education's position, all evidence and information which the board of education believes is pertinent to the case, and legal argument. If the board of education desires, it may include in its response a request for oral argument. Such response must be filed with the Office of Counsel, New York State Education\n\nDepartment, State Education Building, Albany, NY 12234. (c) Within 30 days of the date of notice of the commissioner's recommendation, a panel comprised of three members of the Board of\n\nRegents, appointed by the chancellor, shall convene to consider the commissioner's recommendation, review any written response submitted by the board of education and, if timely requested by the board of education, hear oral argument. (11)\n\nRemoval of schools from registration review, school phase-out or closure. (i) In the event that a school has demonstrated the progress necessary to be removed from registration review, the superintendent may petition the commissioner to remove the school from registration review. If such petition is based upon results of the \"all student\" group on the English language arts and mathematics assessments or graduation rate, such petition shall be submitted pursuant to a date prescribed by the commissioner but no later than December 31st of the calendar year in which such assessments were administered, except that the commissioner may for good cause accept a petition submitted after such date. A school shall not be removed from registration review if, in the commissioner's judgment, conditions that may contribute to a poor learning environment, as identified in paragraph (9) of this subdivision, remain present in the school. (ii)\n\nIn the event that a school placed under registration review prior to the 2010-2011 school year demonstrates previously established progress to be removed from registration review, but is identified in the 2010-2011 school year as persistently lowest-achieving pursuant to subparagraph (9)(ii) of this subdivision, the school shall remain under registration review and shall follow intervention requirements pursuant to subparagraph (10)(iv) of this subdivision. (iii)\n\nIn the event that a school placed under registration review prior to the 2010-2011 school year demonstrates previously established progress to be removed from registration review and is not identified in the 2010-2011 school year as persistently lowest-achieving pursuant to subparagraph (9)(ii) of this subdivision, the school shall be removed from registration review. (iv)\n\nIn the event that a board of education seeks to phase out or close a school under registration review, the board of education (in New York City, the chancellor or chancellor's designee) shall submit for commissioner's\napproval, a plan identifying the intervention that will be implemented and will result in phase out or closure.

For limited English proficient students who have attended school in the United States (not including Puerto Rico) for fewer than three consecutive years, districts and charter schools may administer the NYSESLAT to such students in lieu of the required State assessment in English language arts. Districts or charter schools may, on an individual basis, annually determine to administer the NYSESLAT in lieu of the required assessment in English language arts to limited English proficient students who have attended school in the United States (not including Puerto Rico) for four or five consecutive school years. No exemption is available beyond the student's fifth year and the student must take the required English language arts assessment. (ix)\n\nFor each criterion (subparagraphs [i] through [vii] of this paragraph), the commissioner shall also establish a benchmark against which the performance of the accountability group, all students, defined in subparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision, will be measured. This benchmark will be used in recognizing high-performing schools and districts, determining which school districts are required to develop local assistance plans as described in paragraph (m)(6) of this section and for identifying those schools that are subject to registration review pursuant to paragraph (9) of this subdivision. (15)\n\nAdditional public school, school district, and charter school accountability indicators.

(17)\n\nIdentification of programs for high school equivalency program review. (i) Each year, commencing with 2002-03 school year test administration results, the commissioner shall review the performance of all alternative high school equivalency programs and high school equivalency programs for high school equivalency program review. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner shall identify those programs that have the lowest percentage of students meeting the following criteria: (a) students under the age of 21 who complete 150 hours of instruction who receive a high school equivalency diploma if the student upon entering the program is assessed on an instrument\napproved\nby the commissioner to have a reading and mathematics level at or above grade nine; (b) students under the age of 21 who complete 150 hours of instruction who receive a high school equivalency diploma or advance one high school equivalency literacy level in reading or mathematics if the student upon entering the program is assessed on an instrument\napproved\nby the commissioner to have a reading or mathematics level below grade nine; and\n(c) students under the age of 21 who complete fewer than 150 hours of instruction who receive a high school equivalency diploma or continue in the program during the subsequent school year. (iii)\n\nIn programs in which fewer than 20 students are subject to the criteria in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the commissioner may review prior years' performance of the program in order to make a determination whether the program shall be considered farthest from meeting the criteria. In calculating the performance of a program, the commissioner may exclude from consideration students who complete fewer than 12 hours of instruction. (iv)\n\nThe commissioner may also place under high school equivalency program review any program for which a district or board of cooperative educational services fails to provide in a timely manner the student's performance data required by the commissioner to conduct the annual assessment of the high school equivalency program. (v) For each high school equivalency program identified as having the lowest percentage of students meeting the high school equivalency performance criteria, the local school district or board of cooperative educational services shall be given the opportunity to present to the commissioner additional information. (vi)\n\nThe commissioner shall review the available data, including additional information provided by the district or board of cooperative educational services and determine which of the high school equivalency programs identified as having the lowest percentage of students meeting the criteria of high school equivalency performance established by the commissioner, are most in need of improvement and shall be placed under high school equivalency program review.
