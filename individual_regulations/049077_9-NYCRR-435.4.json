  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 435.4 - General applicant information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Application procedures for funds under\nthis Subchapter shall depend on the type of project for which funds are sought. Applicants for funds for State, municipal or historic preservation projects\nshould refer to Part 436 of this Title, applicants for funds for municipal park\nprojects should refer to Part 437 of this Title and applicants for funds for\nurban cultural park projects should refer to Part 438 of this Title. (b) It shall be the responsibility of the\napplicant to evaluate the proposed project using the eligibility criteria found\nin each Part and to determine under which program to apply for\nassistance. (c) Some projects may\nconsist of several elements which fit into different categories; for example, a\nhistoric property, such as a stone bridge, in a municipal park. Applicants are\nadvised to divide the project into these elements and to submit a separate\napplication for each element under the appropriate program. (d) An applicant shall not submit an\napplication for the same project to different programs for consideration during\nthe same grants cycle. However, applications for separate elements of the same\nproject may be submitted simultaneously. In our example, a municipality may\nsimultaneously apply for a historic preservation grant to repair the stone\nbridge in the municipal park and a municipal park grant to develop a picnic\narea and playground. (e) If an\napplication does not receive funds in two consecutive grants cycles in one\nprogram, it may be submitted for funds under another program. The application\nshould be refiled using the procedures of the second program. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n435.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
