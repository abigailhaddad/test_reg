  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 474.6 - Surrender and cancellation of permits and stickers\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 502\n(a) The permit issued to a carrier for a\nmotor vehicle must be surrendered for cancellation to the State Tax Commission\nand the sticker issued therefor must be destroyed within five days after the\ntermination of his right to the use or control of the motor vehicle. However, if a permit and sticker are issued to the owner and the vehicle is subsequently\nleased, the owner may retain possession of the permit and sticker although they\nmay not be used on any other motor vehicle. (b) A permit issued to the owner of a motor\nvehicle may be surrendered and the sticker destroyed when the motor vehicle is\nleased for a period of more than 30 consecutive days under a lease or agreement\ngranting direct control thereof to the lessee in order to relieve the owner of\nthe necessity of including that vehicle in his tax returns. Similarly, after a\npermit and sticker are issued for a motor vehicle, if the motor vehicle becomes\nexempt from the provisions of article 21 of the Tax Law, the permit may be\nsurrendered and the sticker destroyed, thus relieving the carrier thereof of\nthe necessity of including that vehicle in his tax returns. (See section\n484.2\nof\nthis Title.)\n\nExample: A farmer has obtained a permit and sticker for a truck\nwhich he operates to carry produce from farms not contiguous to his own. The\ntruck will no longer carry such produce but will be used exclusively for one of\nthe purposes set forth in section\n471.5\nof this\n\nTitle. The permit may be surrendered, and the sticker destroyed at the end of\nthe month in which he stops carrying produce from other farms. (c) A permit issued to the lessee of a motor\nvehicle must be surrendered for cancellation and the sticker issued therefor\ndestroyed within five days after the termination of the lease. However, if a\npermit and sticker are issued to a lessee of a motor vehicle, the permit and\nsticker need not be surrendered at the termination of the lease if the lease is\nimmediately renewed or extended and the same lessee continues to operate the\nmotor vehicle. (d) A permit issued\nto the owners of a motor vehicle must be surrendered for cancellation and the\nsticker issued therefor destroyed within five days after a transfer when the\nmotor vehicle for which they were issued is transferred. (e) A permit issued for a motor vehicle must\nbe surrendered for cancellation and the sticker issued therefor destroyed\nwithin five days after the motor vehicle is retired from service or junked, or\nwithin five days after any transfer of the business which results in a change\nof ownership of the motor vehicle. (See sections\n473.4\nand\n474.5\nof this Title.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n474.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
