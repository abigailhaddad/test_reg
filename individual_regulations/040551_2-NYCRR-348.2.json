Tit. 2 § 348.2 - Retroactive application of chapter 710 of the laws of 1989\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where ordinary death benefits are payable\npursuant to section\n60\nor\n360\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw on account of a death which occurred on or after August 7, 1987 and before\n\nJuly 24, 1989 an additional payment shall only be made pursuant to Chapter 710\nif the beneficiary of benefits payable under Chapter 710 is the same\nbeneficiary who received or was entitled to receive ordinary death benefits\nunder prior law. (b) In determining\nwhether additional benefits are payable pursuant to Chapter 710 on account of a\ndeath which occurred on or after August 7, 1987 and before July 24, 1989 to a\nbeneficiary who already received ordinary death benefit payments under section\n60 or 360, and the amount thereof if any, the Retirement System shall compare\nthe value of the ordinary death benefit already paid or payable with the amount\nthat would be payable under the option election filed in connection with the\ndecedent's application for disability retirement. In the case of Tier 2\nmembers, the amount of post-retirement death benefits payable shall also be\nconsidered. (c) The comparison\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of this section, immediately above, shall be\nperformed in the following manner: (1)\n\nWhere\nthe member elected Option one, the initial value shall be compared to the death\nbenefit payment. If the initial value is greater, the difference between the\ninitial value and the death benefit payment shall be paid. (2)\n\nWhere the member elected a joint and\nsurvivor option or a \"pop-up option\", the ordinary death benefit shall be\ndivided by the beneficiary's unisex annuity value. If the annual option payment\nis greater, an annual allowance equal to the difference shall be\npaid. (3)\n\nWhere a five- or\n10-year-certain option was elected, the procedure provided in subdivision (c)\nparagraph (2) should be followed, using a five- or 10-year-certain annuity\nvalue. (d) Where the\ndisability application was filed without prejudice to a service retirement\napplication and the optional reserve was paid under the service retirement\nbenefit, the Retirement System shall compare the disability benefit as provided\nunder Chapter 710 with the service retirement benefit and pay the greater of\nthe two amounts.
