Eye\nexaminations which do not meet this standard will not be considered acceptable\nfor purposes of payment from funds under public tax-supported medical care\nprograms. Payment of this fee is effective August 1, 1975. (b) The fees provided herein (including\nmarkup) are intended to cover all services performed by the above providers in\nconnection with the dispensing of eyeglasses and will be considered full\npayment for services rendered under State-administered programs. Under the\nmedical assistance program, which is administered by local social services\ndistricts, these fees (including markup) represent a maximum allowance for\npurposes of State reimbursement. (c) Need for two pairs of eyeglasses, one\npair for distance and one for near vision, should be uncommon. Such dispensing\nmust be substantiated by the patient's particular needs, such as proven\ninability to tolerate bifocals, the unusual nature of the patient's correction, physical ailments, and other conditions which make provision of bifocals\ninadvisable. Two pairs of eyeglasses should not be provided merely as an\nalternative to bifocals to satisfy an unjustificable preference on the part of\nthe patient, for personal convenience or for cosmetic purposes. (d) The following standards shall be observed\nin providing lenses and frames. (1)\n\nIn all\nclaims for payment, the model or style, name, catalog number and name of\nmanufacturer of the lenses and frames supplied must be included. (2)\n\nAll lenses, frames and frame parts shall\nbe guaranteed against defects in manufacture or assembly. (3)\n\nBilling may be based on wholesale\nprescription assembled cost, regardless of origin of finished\nservices. (4)\n\nAll claims for\npayment are subject to audit which must include verification of wholesale\ncosts. (5)\n\nOnly first quality\nframes shall be supplied. The dispenser shall be responsible for any needed\nreplacement or repairs that are due to defects in quality or material or\nworkmanship. (6)\n\nFrames provided\nshall not exceed a wholesale cost of four dollars except, that for clinical\nreasons documented by the prescribing ophthalmologist or optometrist, a more\nexpensive frame may be approved for an individual. Such exceptions require\nprior approval by the appropriate medical director and prior authorization by\nthe social services commissioner. (7)\n\nNo extra charge shall be made by a\ndispenser of eyeglasses for future fittings and adjustments if he has dispensed\nthe eyeglasses. Provision for this service has been included in the above\nfee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
