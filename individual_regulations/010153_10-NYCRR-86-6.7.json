  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 86-6.7 - Hospice reimbursement for room and board provided to patients residing in a nursing facility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Daily payment will be made to a hospice for Medicaid eligible patients who have elected the hospice benefit and reside in a nursing facility (see 42 USC\n1396\na [a][13][D]). Payment shall be made for a hospice patient to take into account the room and board furnished by the nursing facility and will be in an amount equal to 95 percent of the facility rate that would have been paid by the State to the facility in accordance with the applicable provisions of Subpart 86-2 of this Part, if the patient had not elected to receive hospice care. A hospice cannot bill for this additional amount on a day in which the patient who has elected hospice care is receiving either general inpatient or inpatient respite care. Patients covered under provisions set forth in this section must be patients who would be eligible under Medicaid for nursing facility services if he/she had not elected to receive hospice care. (b) To be eligible to receive Medicaid payment as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, a hospice must have a written agreement with a nursing facility under which the hospice takes full responsibility for the professional management of the patient' s hospice care, and the nursing facility agrees to provide room and board to the patient, collect any patient payment contributions, and maintain an accounting of the patient's financial contribution.
