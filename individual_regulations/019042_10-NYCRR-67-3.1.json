(b) Laboratories shall report the results of all blood lead analyses performed on residents of New York State to the Commissioner of Health and to the local health officers in whose jurisdictions the subjects of the tests reside. If the laboratory reports electronically to the Commissioner of Health in accordance with subdivision (e) of this section, the Department of Health shall notify the appropriate local health officer of the test results and the laboratory shall be deemed to have satisfied the reporting requirements of this section. (c) Whenever a laboratory refers a blood lead sample to another laboratory for analysis, the laboratories may agree on which laboratory will report in compliance with this Subpart, but both laboratories will be accountable to insure that a report is made. (d) All laboratories shall report electronically to the Commissioner of Health each blood lead analysis conducted. The report must include the subject's name, date of birth, race, gender, address, county of residence, type of sample (venous or fingerstick) and blood lead level; the health care practitioner ordering the test, laboratory identifiers, the date the sample was collected and the date of analysis. Reporting pursuant to this subdivision shall be done using an electronic telecommunication system consistent with the technical specifications established by the department.

(f) Time limits for reporting and special notification requirements of blood lead levels in children. (1)\n\nLaboratories shall report the results of all blood lead tests as specified in this Subpart within five business days of the date of analysis.
