Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, ch. I, subch. D, pt. 61\n\nStatutory authority: Public Service Law, §§20, 142\n\nProceedings involving the reasonableness of existing or\nproposed rates vary so greatly in character and scope that it is impossible to\nprescribe rules of universal application that are suited to all rate\nproceedings. These proceedings range all the way from a simple proposal to\nchange a rule which would increase or decrease the bills being paid by a few\nconsumers to a broad proceeding involving all of the rates of a utility\nrendering service in the entire State. The former may require only one brief\nhearing because of the simplicity of the questions involved. The latter, as the\nexperience of the commission has demonstrated, may consume years, require\nscores of hearings and thousands of pages of testimony preceded by long and\ntedious investigations of property, inventories and values together with\nextended analyses of operating costs, etc. Because of these facts, no attempt\nis here made to specify the data that must be supplied in all rate proceedings, but the following are of general application. Possibly the only one of\nuniversal application is the one first mentioned [see section\n61.1\nof this Part] which finds its\norigin in the Public Service Law. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
