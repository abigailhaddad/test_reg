  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.921 - Conducting a baseline assessment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Assessment methods. An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in\neach covered segment by applying one or more of the following methods depending\non the threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must\nselect the method or methods best suited to address the threats identified to\nthe covered segment. (See section\n255.917\nof this Part.)\n(1)\n\nInternal inspection tool or tools capable\nof detecting corrosion, and any other threats to which the covered segment is\nsusceptible. An operator must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), section 6.2\nin selecting the appropriate internal inspection tools for the covered\nsegment. (2)\n\nPressure test\nconducted in accordance with the testing requirements of this Part. An operator\nmust use the test pressures specified in table 3 of section 5 of ASME/ANSI\nB31.8S, to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with section\n255.939\nof this Part. (3)\n\nDirect assessment to address threats of\nexternal corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. An\noperator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements\nlisted in section\n255.923\nof this Part and with, as\napplicable, the requirements specified in section\n255.925, 255.927 or\n255.929\nof this Part. (4)\n\nOther technology that an operator\ndemonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the\nline pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify the department and OPS\n180 days before conducting the assessment, in accordance with section\n255.949\nof this Part. (b) Prioritizing segments. An\noperator must prioritize the covered pipeline segments for the baseline\nassessment according to a risk analysis that considers the potential threats to\neach covered segment. The risk analysis must comply with the requirements in\nsection\n255.917\nof this Part. (c) Assessment for particular threats. In\nchoosing an assessment method for the baseline assessment of each covered\nsegment, an operator must take the actions required in section\n255.917\n(e) of\nthis Part to address particular threats that it has identified. (d) Time period. An operator must prioritize\nall the covered segments for assessment in accordance with section\n255.917\n(c) of\nthis Part and subdivision (b) of this section. An operator must assess at least\n50 percent of the covered segments beginning with the highest risk segments, by\n\nDecember 17, 2007. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of all\ncovered segments by December 17, 2012. (e) Prior assessment. An operator may use a\nprior integrity assessment conducted before December 17, 2002 as a baseline\nassessment for the covered segment, if the integrity assessment meets the\nbaseline requirements in this Part and subsequent remedial actions to address\nthe conditions listed in section\n255.933\nof this Part have been\ncarried out. In addition, if an operator uses this prior assessment as its\nbaseline assessment, the operator must reassess the line pipe in the covered\nsegment according to the requirements of sections 255.937 and\n255.939\nof this Part. (f) Newly identified areas. When an operator\nidentifies a new high consequence area (see section\n255.905\nof this Part), an operator\nmust complete the baseline assessment of the line pipe in the newly identified\nhigh consequence area within 10 years from the date the area is\nidentified. (g) Newly installed\npipe. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of a newly installed\nsegment of pipe covered by this Part within 10 years from the date the pipe is\ninstalled. An operator may conduct a pressure test in accordance with paragraph\n(a)(2) of this section, to satisfy the requirement for a baseline\nassessment. (h) Plastic\ntransmission pipeline. If the threat analysis required in section\n255.917\n(d) of\nthis Part on a plastic transmission pipeline indicates that a covered segment\nis susceptible to failure from causes other than third-party damage, an\noperator must conduct a baseline assessment of the segment in accordance with\nthe requirements of this section and of section\n255.917\nof this Part. The operator\nmust justify the use of an alternative assessment method that will address the\nidentified threats to the covered segment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.921\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
