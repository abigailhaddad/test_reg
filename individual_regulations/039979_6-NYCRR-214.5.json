  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 214.5 - Wet quench towers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A person may\nnot operate a wet quench tower of a coke oven battery unless it is equipped\nwith a baffle system designed to effectively reduce particulate emissions\nduring quenching. (b) Except as\nprovided in subdivision (c) of this section, the total dissolved solids\nconcentration of any quench tower make-up water must not exceed 1,600\nmilligrams per liter (mg/l). Compliance with this limit will be determined by\ntaking the arithmetic average of the total dissolved solids concentrations of\neach of four samples of make-up water obtained at 15-minute intervals. The\ntotal dissolved solids concentration of an individual sample will be determined\nby the latest American society for testing and materials method or equivalent\nin which the drying temperature must be 103° C. (c) Total dissolved solids concentrations\nfrom make-up water may exceed 1,600 mg/l if it can be shown that particulate\nemissions from the quench tower do not exceed.45 pounds per ton of coal charged\nthrough an emissions test conducted in compliance with section\n214.11\n(c) of this\n\nPart. If such a demonstration is made, the actual average concentration of the\nquench tower make-up water used during the test will become an acceptable\nmaximum limit for the tested quench tower. If the source owner wants to use\nmake-up water with a higher concentration then used during the quench tower\nemissions test, additional testing may be required. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n214.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
