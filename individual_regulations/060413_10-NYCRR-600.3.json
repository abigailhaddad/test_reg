Tit. 10 § 600.3 - Amendments and modifications to applications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A change to an\napplication before the Public Health and Health Planning Council has approved\nor contingently approved the application is hereafter referred to as a\nrevision; a change to an application which has been approved or contingently\napproved by the council but for which an operating certificate has not yet been\nissued shall be referred to as an amendment if it meets the criteria contained\nin subdivision (c) of this section, and shall be referred to as a modification\napprovable pursuant to subdivision (f) if it does not meet the criteria\ncontained in subdivision (c) or does not meet the criteria in subdivision\n(e). (b) An application made to the\n\nPublic Health and Health Planning Council, pursuant to this Part, may be\nmodified before the council has approved or contingently approved the\napplication. Such modifications shall be made on appropriate forms supplied by\nthe department and submitted to the council through the central office of the\ndepartment in Albany and shall be governed by the following: (1)\nany modification in the information\ncontained in the original application must be accompanied by a satisfactory\nwritten explanation as to the reason such information was not contained in the\noriginal application; (2)\nthe\ndepartment, when reviewing a competitive batch of applications, may establish\ndeadlines pursuant to written notification for the submission of any\nmodification to an application; and\n(3)\nif a modification is submitted after any\nsuch deadline(s), the application shall be removed from consideration within\nthe competitive batch being reviewed. (c) After the Public Health and Health\n\nPlanning Council has approved or contingently approved an application but prior\nto the issuance of an operating certificate, any change as set forth in\nparagraphs (1) through (3) of this subdivision shall constitute an amendment to\nthe application, and the applicant shall submit the proposed amendment to the\ndepartment's central office together with appropriate documentation explaining\nthe reason(s) for the amendment and such additional documentation as may be\nrequired in support of such amendment. The amended application shall be\nreferred to the health systems agency having geographic jurisdiction and the\n\nPublic Health and Health Planning Council for their reevaluation and\nrecommendations. The approval of the Public Health and Health Planning Council\nmust be obtained for any such amendment. Each of the following shall constitute\nan amendment: (1)\na change in the number\nand/or type of beds and/or services, other than a reduction of service which\nwould be subject to administrative review; (2)\na change in the location of the site of\nthe construction if outside the facility's service area or adjacent service\narea; and\n(3)\nany change in the\napplicant. (d) For\npurposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following\nmeanings: (1)\n\nTotal project cost means total\ncosts for construction, including but not limited to costs for demolition work, site preparation, design and construction contingencies, total costs for real\nproperty, for fixed and movable equipment, architectural and/or engineering\nfees, legal fees, construction manager and/or cost consultant fees, construction loan interest costs, and other financing, professional and\nancillary fees and charges. If any asset is to be acquired through a leasing\narrangement, the relevant cost shall be the cost of the asset as if purchased\nfor cash, not the lease amount. (2)\n\nTotal basic cost of construction means total project costs less the capitalized\namount of construction loan interest and financing fees. (e) (1)\n\nIf\nthe commissioner, acting on behalf of the Public Health and Health Planning\n\nCouncil, determines that increases in total project costs or total basic costs\nof construction are due to factors of an emergency nature such as labor\nstrikes, fires, floods or other natural disasters or factors beyond the control\nof the applicant, or modifications to the architectural aspects of the\napplication which are made on the recommendation of the department, the\napplicant may proceed without the need for the application to be referred back\nto the health systems agency and the Public Health and Health Planning\n\nCouncil. (2)\n\nIf the applicant can\ndocument by evidence acceptable to the commissioner, acting on behalf of the\n\nPublic Health and Health Planning Council, that increases in total project cost\nor total basic cost of construction were caused by delays in obtaining zoning\nor planning approvals which were beyond its control, the commissioner may\npermit review of the application to proceed without the need for the\napplication to be referred back to the health systems agency and the Public\n\nHealth and Health Planning Council pursuant to this Part. The evidence shall\ndemonstrate clearly that the applicant had timely pursued the zoning or\nplanning permits, has now obtained all such required permits and approvals, and\nis prepared to proceed with the project. (3)\n\nIf the applicant can document by evidence\nacceptable to the commissioner, acting on behalf of the Public Health and\n\nHealth Planning Council, that increases in the total basic cost of construction\nwere caused by inflation in excess of that estimated and approved in the\napplication and that such inflation has affected the total basic cost of\nconstruction as a result of delays which were beyond the applicant's control, the commissioner may permit review of the application to proceed without the\nneed for the application to be referred back to the health systems agency and\nthe Public Health and Health Planning Council pursuant to this Part. The\nevidence shall demonstrate clearly that the increase in inflation exceeds that\nestimated and approved in the application, and that any delays resulting in\nsuch inflationary cost increases were beyond the applicant's control. (f) Any modification submitted\nsubsequent to the issuance of any approval by the Council which does not\nconstitute an amendment pursuant to the provisions of this section shall\nrequire only the prior approval of the commissioner. (g) Failure to disclose an amendment prior to\nthe issuance of an operating certificate shall constitute sufficient grounds\nfor the revocation, limitation or annulment of the approval of\nestablishment.
