  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 648.1 - Mortgages for indefinite amounts\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 256\n(a) A mortgage for an indefinite amount is one where it is not possible to\ndetermine from the terms of the mortgage itself the maximum amount of principal\ndebt or obligation which is, or under any contingency may be, secured at the\ndate of execution thereof or at any time thereafter. (b) (1)\n\nIf\na mortgage secures the repayment of a specific sum of money and also contains\nprovisions that set forth that the mortgage may secure additional amounts, which represent expenses incurred by the mortgagee on behalf of the mortgagor\nin the event of the mortgagor's failure to perform a covenant or obligation\nunder the terms of the mortgage relating to maintaining the real property, preserving its value and protecting the mortgagee's lien, the expenses in the\nevent of a foreclosure, and interest and late payment charges, which shall be\nreferred to for purposes of this Part as incidental amounts, such a mortgage is\nnot a mortgage for an indefinite amount, provided that such failure to perform\na covenant or obligation under the terms of the mortgage resulting in such\nexpenses being incurred by the mortgagee, constitutes a condition of default\nunder the terms of the mortgage. (2)\n\nExamples of incidental amounts as\ndescribed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, which may become secured by a\nmortgage for the purpose of maintaining and preserving the value of the real\nproperty or protecting the mortgagee's lien are as follows: (i) the amounts paid by the mortgagee for\nreal property taxes, charges or assessments which are imposed by law upon the\nmortgaged premises upon failure of the mortgagor to do so, where such failure\nconstitutes a default under the mortgage; (ii)\nthe amounts paid by the mortgagee for\ninsurance premiums covering the mortgaged premises upon failure by the\nmortgagor to do so, where such failure constitutes a default under the\nmortgage; and\n(iii)\nany amount, cost or charge to which the mortgagee becomes subrogated upon payment, provided\nsuch payment is made as a result of the mortgagor's failure to pay the same and\nsuch failure constitutes an event of default under the mortgage. (3)\n\nWhere a mortgagee has advanced\nsums of money on behalf of the mortgagor in payment of incidental amounts as\ndescribed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, or the mortgagee has deferred\nthe payment of such incidental amounts due from the mortgagor, and the mortgage\nis modified or otherwise amended to provide that such advances or deferrals are\nto be secured by the mortgage as modified or amended, thus increasing the\namount secured by the mortgage, the recording of an instrument evidencing such\nincrease in the amount secured shall be taxable in accordance with section\n645.2\n(a) of this Title.
