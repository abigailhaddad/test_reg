  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 111.1 - General information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A savings and loan association which\nseeks to convert itself into a savings bank pursuant to Banking Law, section\n411 shall comply with the instructions set forth in this Supervisory Procedure\nSL 111. (b) Six copies of a letter\nof application and each document referred to in section\n111.2, including two executed\ncopies of the documents referred to in subdivisions (a), (b), (c) and (f) of\nsection\n111.2, shall be filed with the\nsuperintendent, at the address set forth in section\n1.1\nof Supervisory Policy G 1 of\nthis Title, and shall be accompanied by payment of the fees specified in\nsection\n1.2\nof Supervisory Policy G 1 of\nthis Title; provided, however, that the organization certificate required by\nsubdivision (b) of section\n111.2\nshall be filed only after\nreceipt of the superintendent's written approval of the proposed conversion. Inquiries concerning the preparation thereof should be addressed to the\nsuperintendent. The letter of application shall set forth the name and address\nof the officer to whom all communications from the Banking Department should be\naddressed and the date or proposed date of filing of any required applications\nor other documents with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. (c) Before an application for conversion is\nsubmitted, the plan of conversion shall be approved by the vote, in person or\nby proxy, of the holders of at least 662/3 percent in amount of book value of\nall outstanding shares of the association represented at a meeting held upon\nnot less than 20 days' written notice to each shareholder. Notice of the\nshareholders' meeting, together with any proxy material, shall be served\npersonally upon or mailed to each shareholder at his last known address and\nshall contain a statement of the time and place of the meeting, a full and\nclear statement of the purpose thereof and the effect of the proposed\nconversion upon the shareholder's right to vote on matters affecting the\nmanagement of the resulting savings bank. (d) Approval by the superintendent will be\nconditioned in all cases upon the insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance\n\nCorporation of deposit accounts of the resulting bank to the extent permitted\nby Federal law. (e) After the\nconversion, the powers of the resulting savings bank, including its powers to\nreceive new deposits, make new loans and undertake new borrowings will be\nsubject to the laws governing savings banks, except to the extent it has as a\nresult of the conversion succeeded to certain deposits, loans and borrowings\nwhich are legal for an association but not legal for a savings bank. While the\nresulting bank will ordinarily be required to dispose of such deposits, loans\nand borrowings within two years after the date of the conversion, it may\ndischarge any legal obligations which it had previously undertaken, as an\nassociation, in connection with such nonconforming deposits, loans and\nborrowings. The plan of conversion must specifically describe, by type and\namount, such nonconforming deposits, loans and borrowings, and indicate the\nmanner in which they are to be disposed of by the resulting savings\nbank. (f) The superintendent\nreserves the right to require additional information in connection with the\napplication. The applicant may, of course, submit any information in addition\nto that required by this procedure which it deems pertinent to the\napplication. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
