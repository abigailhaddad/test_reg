  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 352.16 - Exemption of income and resources-general policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When the terms of an award, the\nlegislative intent of a government benefit, the rules of an organization paying\na benefit, the nature of a trust fund, or the agreed upon intent of a friend, nonlegally responsible relative, social agency or other organization limits the\nuse of cash income, the social services official shall abide by such\nrestriction, when verified. The restriction may limit the use of the income to\na specified purpose or to a particular member or members of the household. However, whenever any contribution from a nonlegally responsible relative or\nfriend is sought to be restricted for the purpose of supplementing a\n\nState-prescribed or -approved standard it shall not qualify as a permissible\nrestriction of income, unless the social services official determines that the\nhealth and welfare of the recipient would be specifically and materially\nenhanced thereby. (b) No grant or\nloan to an undergraduate student for educational purposes made or insured under\nany program administered by the United States Secretary of Education shall be\nconsidered as income or resources in determining need and amount of\nassistance. (c) No grants or loans, including but not limited to undergraduate or graduate school grants, loans or\nscholarships, which are obtained and used under conditions that preclude their\nuse for current living costs, shall be considered to be income or resources in\ndetermining need and the amount of assistance. (d) For SSI recipients applying for HR: (1)\nin-kind income as determined by the\n\nSocial Security Administration must not be considered as available income\nunless a separate verification of its availability is made; and\n(2)\nthat portion of the SSI grant being\nrecouped by the Social Security Administration must not be considered as\navailable income. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n352.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
