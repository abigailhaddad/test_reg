  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 76.0 - Preamble and purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Correction Law section 753 states that the public policy of New York, as expressed in Correction Law Article 23-A, is to encourage the licensure and employment of persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses. Correction Law section 752 forbids discrimination based upon a conviction for a previous criminal offense unless there is a direct relationship between one or more of the previous offenses and the specific employment sought or held by the individual; or the granting or continuation of employment would involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public. Correction Law section 753 specifies eight factors, including the public policy of the state, to be considered in making a determination pursuant to section 752. (b) However, commercial crime insurance policies often have provisions that will exclude coverage for loss or damage caused by an employee who has been convicted of a criminal offense, where the employer knew about the conviction prior to the loss or damage. This puts employers in the untenable position of either not being able to obtain insurance or violating the Correction Law by not hiring the individual, even though a review of the Correction Law factors would weigh in favor of employment. Given the strong public policy of the State, the Superintendent has determined that it would be an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act and practice in the conduct of the business of insurance in this state for an insurer that writes commercial crime insurance policies in this state to exclude coverage where the employer has weighed the factors set out in Correction Law Article 23-A and made a determination favorable to the employee.
