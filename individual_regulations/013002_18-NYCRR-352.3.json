in receipt of a court ordered\nshelter supplement, or a temporary shelter supplement pursuant to section\n370.10\nof this Title, at the time\nthis paragraph is adopted and, who are otherwise eligible for public assistance\nwill continue to receive that supplement, if higher than the shelter allowance\nset forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, for up to a two year period, provided that there is no break in assistance of more than one calendar month\nor that the family has not been sanctioned. After a two year period from the\ndate this paragraph is adopted or upon a break in receipt of a court ordered\nsupplement or a supplement under section\n370.10\nof this Title of more than\none calendar month, applicants and recipients who were receiving a court\nordered shelter supplement or a temporary shelter supplement pursuant to\nsection\n370.10\nof this Title, must receive\na shelter allowance pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, if otherwise\neligible. The amount of the shelter supplement in excess of the shelter\nallowance maxima set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision is not part of\nthe standard of need. (3)\n(i) A social services district, with the\napproval of the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, may provide\nadditional monthly shelter supplements to public assistance applicants and\nrecipients who will reside in private housing, or who currently reside in\nprivate housing and are facing eviction. Social services districts choosing to\nprovide such supplements must submit a plan to the Office of Temporary and\n\nDisability Assistance, attention: Center for Employment and Economic Supports, prior to providing any such supplements. Plans submitted to the office must\ninclude: justification for providing the supplement(s), the targeted\npopulation, the amount of the supplement(s) and any additional information as\nrequired by the office. The supplement(s) must be a monthly amount that, when\ncombined with the shelter allowance, does not exceed the rental obligation or\nhome ownership shelter expenses of the applicant or recipient. The amount of\nthe shelter supplement is not part of the standard of need. (ii)\n\nThe office may authorize a social\nservices district to provide such supplement or a distinct part of such\nsupplement if it determines that the provision of such supplement would\naccomplish its stated purpose and is justified considering such factors as\nlength of temporary housing stays, existing litigation and other factors\naffecting the availability of housing. The office must also consider the impact\nof granting the supplement on the economic incentives for self-sufficiency and\nthe impact on low-income households which are not in receipt of public\nassistance. The office may authorize the supplement only if it determines that\nthere are sufficient funds available to provide such reimbursement. (b) When the recipient\nis obligated to pay for water as a separate charge to a vendor, an allowance\nmust be made for the additional amount required to be paid. When the recipient\nis obligated to pay for sewer, water (except when paid as a separate charge)\nand/or garbage disposal, an allowance must be made therefor to the extent that\nthe total of the rent allowances plus such charge or charges does not exceed\nthe appropriate maximum amount in the schedule in subdivision (a) of this\nsection. For the purpose of this subdivision, the term\nseparate\ncharge\nrefers to a billing made directly to a recipient in his or her\nname which is limited to charges for his or her utility service. (c) [\nReserved\n]\n(d) Public housing. (1)\n(i) An\nallowance for rent must be made for recipients who are tenants of city, State\nor federally aided public housing up to the amount actually paid or the\nfollowing schedule, whichever is less, except when a modified schedule of\nallowances is approved by this office for a specific housing authority and the\nmodified schedule provides for larger allowances or when the housing authority\ncalculates the rent based on a percentage of household income: (a) Effective August 15, 2007, public housing\nauthorities may charge rent up to 50 percent of the shelter maximums found in\nsubdivision (a) of this section. (b) Effective August 15, 2008, public housing\nauthorities may charge rent up to 75 percent of the shelter maximum found in\nsubdivision (a) of this section. (c) Effective August 15, 2009, public housing\nauthorities may charge rent up to the shelter maximums found in subdivision (a)\nof this section. (ii)\n\nModified schedule approved. When a modified schedule is approved by this office\nfor a specific housing authority, the allowance for rent must be the amount\nactually paid up to the approved schedule amount. A housing authority may\nrequest, and the office may grant an increase not to exceed 10 percent in a\n12-month period until the modified schedule for the housing authority reaches\nthe maximum allowances for the district found in subdivision (a) of this\nsection. Effective August 15, 2009, modified schedules approved by this office\nshall be void. (iii)\n\nRent\ncalculated based on a percentage of income. For any household for which the\namount of rent is determined by a public housing authority as a percentage of\neither gross or adjusted gross income, the applicable shelter allowance is the\namount so calculated up to the maximum allowance for the given household size\nfound in subdivision (a) of this section. (2)\n(i) Subsidized housing other than section 8 housing vouchers. The rent allowance\nfor tenants of housing subsidized under a housing assistance payments program, except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, is the amount of\nrent actually paid (exclusive of the subsidy) but not more than the amount in\nthe applicable schedule in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section. (ii)\n\nSection 8 Voucher Program. (a) The rent for recipients whose rental\nhousing payments are subsidized under the Section 8 Voucher Program (not\nincluding a recipient participating in the program of special allowances for\nowners of manufactured homes) shall be the amount actually paid, but not in\nexcess of the amount (rounded to the nearest whole dollar) equal to 30 percent\nof the applicable standard of need by family size and district of residence, considering only the SA-2a, SA-2b, SA-2c schedules contained in section\n352.2\n(d) of this\n\nPart, and the local agency monthly shelter allowance schedule with children, exclusive of any supplement. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the\nallowance amounts are those in office regulation and in effect on the filing\ndate of this subparagraph. (b) Clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph shall not apply to recipients\nwhose section 8 vouchers are provided by public housing authorities or other\nlocal section 8 voucher issuing agencies that routinely determined the tenants'\nshare of the rent due and payable for months commencing on or before October 1, 2004 to be the local agency shelter maximums under subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (c) The office shall\ndevelop an administrative process to certify whether clause\n(\na\n) or (\nb\n) of this subparagraph shall apply\nto each individual public housing authority or other local section 8 voucher\nissuing agency. (e) Rent allowances for hotel/motel\nfacilities. An allowance for shelter shall be made for recipients\ntemporarily housed in hotel/motel facilities under the following\ncircumstances: (1)\n\nNo other suitable\nhousing either public or private is available to house the recipient. (2)\n\nHotel/motel accommodations without\ncooking facilities shall be utilized only when accommodations with such\nfacilities are not available. An allowance for the actual cost of the rental of\na refrigerator, not to exceed $10 per week per room, shall be made when a\nhomeless family is temporarily placed in a hotel/motel which does not have\ncooking facilities and which provides a refrigerator on a rental\nbasis. (3)\n\nThe continued need for\nhotel/motel accommodations shall be reviewed, evaluated and authorized monthly\nby the social services district. (f) Reimbursement for shelter costs and\nrestaurant allowances and rental fees for refrigerators as provided for in\nparagraph (e)(2) of this section is available to social services districts for\nexpenditures made by such districts on behalf of recipients temporarily living\nin hotels or motels for so long as the recipients are actively seeking\npermanent housing, but in no event for a period in excess of six months unless\nthe local commissioner of social services determines on an annual basis that\nhousing other than hotels or motels or facilities regulated under Part 900 of\nthis Title is not readily available in the social services district and the\ncommissioner submits such determination to the department on an annual basis. Upon such a determination and submission, the social services district will\ncontinue to be reimbursed for shelter costs, restaurant allowances as\nappropriate and rental fees for refrigerators provided to public assistance\nrecipients beyond such six- month period. A recipient's continued need for\nhotel/motel accommodations must be reviewed and evaluated monthly. The maximum\nreimbursable amount for shelter costs after August 1, 1984 is $16 per day for\nthe first person in each hotel room, and $11 per day for the remaining\noccupants in each room. Restaurant allowances, if necessary must be provided in\naccordance with department regulations. (g) Standards. No family shall be referred to a hotel/motel, nor shall\nany reimbursement be made for costs incurred from such referral unless all of\nthe requirements set forth below are met: (1)\n\nPrimary consideration shall be given to\nthe needs of children. Specific factors considered must include but shall not\nbe limited to educational needs, security, the nature of the facility in which\nthe children would be placed, and factors which will insure the minimum\ndisruption of community ties. (2)\n\nThe hotel/motel shall have appropriate contractual or other arrangements for\nmaintenance, repair and sanitation in the hotel/motel.

(i) (1)\n\nTo\nthe extent that units of housing are available and subject to department\napproval based upon the housing conditions in the region, and to the extent of\n\nState appropriations made expressly therefor, social services districts may\nprovide an allowance to secure housing to any homeless family: (i) residing in a municipality having a\nrental vacancy rate for low-income housing less than three percent; (ii)\nfor whom no housing can be located at a\nrent within the shelter maximum under this section; and\n(iii)\nin which at least one member of the\nfamily has resided in a hotel or motel and/or a shelter (including, but not\nlimited to, facilities operated under Part 900 of this Title) at public expense\nfor a period exceeding 12 weeks. Social services districts may consider\ndecreasing this length of stay requirement if a long-term temporary placement\nin a hotel or motel or shelter would be detrimental to the health and welfare\nof families, including families with immediate medical needs. (2)\n\nIn determining priority for\nplacement in housing units for which an allowance is paid under this\nsubdivision, the district must consider factors affecting need such as: (i) the length of stay in a hotel or motel\nand/or a shelter (including but not limited to, facilities operated under Part\n900 of this Title) at public expense; (ii)\nthe size of the family; and\n(iii)\nthe location of schools in relation to\nthe temporary housing where the family is residing. (3)\n\nSocial services districts must submit to\nthe department for approval annual plans for the operation of programs to make\nallowances available under this subdivision. Plans must be submitted within 45\ndays after funds have been authorized in the State budget for allowances for\nthis program. Plans must: (i) indicate the\nnumber of units of housing for which the allowance will be made available\npursuant to this subdivision, identifying the number that would be privately\nowned units and the number that would be publicly owned units, and the amount\nof funds being requested; (ii)\ndescribe the housing to be utilized; (iii)\nindicate the number of months that the\nallowance will be available (not to exceed eight months in the case of\nprivately owned units or four months in the case of publicly owned\nunits); (iv)\nset forth the\nprocedures for assuring local housing code compliance; (v) set forth the procedures to identify\nthose families likely to be long-term residents of hotels and motels and/or\nshelters (including, but not limited to, facilities operated under Part 900 of\nthis Title); (vi)\nindicate the\ncriteria to be used in determining priorities for placement; (vii)\nindicate the services available in the\nsocial services district to assist persons to remain in housing after placement\nunder this program; (viii)\nindicate\nthe number of homeless families in the social services district that requested\nemergency housing each month during the most recent 12-month period and the\nnumber of families that resided in hotels and motels and/or shelters during the\nmost recent 12-month period; and\n(ix)\nindicate the number of months that the\nsocial services district will require participating landlords to make specified\napartments available to selected families. (4)\n\nThe allowance consists of a rent\nsupplement in an amount to be determined by the social services district, with\nthe prior approval of the department, but cannot exceed the difference between\nthe maximum shelter allowance and the hotel/motel rate for the family. Social\nservices districts must submit claims for State reimbursement for such\nallowances on forms and in the manner prescribed by the department. (5)\n\nNo allowance will be paid under this\nsubdivision for housing developed for the homeless financed partially or wholly\nwith public funds. (6)\n\nNo allowance\nunder this subdivision will be paid unless the social services district\ndocuments that such allowance will not be used to replace funds previously\nused, or designated for use, to secure housing for homeless families. (7)\n\nNo allowance provided under this\nsubdivision will be paid for housing which does not comply with or which is not\nbrought into substantial compliance with the local housing code or which has\nbeen occupied by a family receiving AFDC or home relief within one year prior\nto the payment of an allowance hereunder; provided, however, that such\nallowance may be held in escrow by the district pending correction of existing\ncode violations. Moreover, no allowance will be paid unless the participating\nlandlord agrees to make a specified apartment available to the selected family\nfor a period of up to 32 months as approved by the department, except as\nprovided herein. The landlord must agree that, in the event that a selected\nfamily does not remain for any reason in the specified apartment for the period\nfor which it is to be available, the landlord will return a pro rata portion of\nthe allowance reflecting the balance of the period. In such event, the district\nmay provide an allowance with respect to a subsequently selected family for the\nbalance of the period, provided further that such family meets the eligibility\ncriteria set forth in this subdivision. (8)\n\nAllowances provided under this\nsubdivision must be paid for a maximum period specified by the district and\napproved by the department. (9)\n\nSocial services districts providing allowances under this subdivision must\nsubmit information on a monthly basis in a manner prescribed by the department, including but not limited to: (i) the number\nof units rented that were privately owned and the number of units rented that\nwere publicly owned and the addresses of such units; (ii)\nthe individual allowances issued; and\n(iii)\nthe number of families\nleaving apartments funded with allowances under this subdivision. (j) If rent has not\nbeen paid for the month in which the case is accepted, a non-prorated shelter\nallowance, not to exceed the appropriate local agency maximum monthly shelter\nallowance, must be provided to retain the living accommodation. (k) Emergency shelter\nallowances. (1)\n\nAn emergency shelter\nallowance must be provided, upon request, to a household composed of an\napplicant for or recipient of public assistance, who has been medically\ndiagnosed as having AIDS or HIV-related illness as defined from time-to-time by\nthe AIDS Institute of the State Department of Health, and any household members\nresiding with such person. Such household must be homeless or faced with\nhomelessness and have no viable and less costly alternative housing available. The social and medical needs of the household members must be considered in\nmaking a determination concerning availability of alternative housing. (i) An applicant for or recipient of public\nassistance medically diagnosed as having AIDS or HIV-related illness is\nconsidered to be the \"first person\" in the household, and qualifies the\nhousehold for an emergency shelter allowance. The first person may or may not\nbe in receipt of supplemental security income (SSI). (ii)\n\nThe income and needs of the first person\nmedically diagnosed as having AIDS or HIV-related illness and any additional\nhousehold member that is not in receipt of SSI are used in calculating an\nemergency shelter allowance, as described in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. (iii)\n\nThe SSI income\nand needs of any household member not considered the first person medically\ndiagnosed as having AIDS or HIV-related illness are not used in calculating an\nemergency shelter allowance. (2)\n\nAn emergency shelter allowance must not\nexceed $480 for the first person in the household and $330 for each additional\nhousehold member, and in no event be greater than the household's actual\nmonthly rent due. Except for cases specified in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision, the emergency shelter allowance is considered to be the\nhousehold's public assistance shelter allowance for public assistance budgeting\npurposes. (3)\n\nWhen a household\ncomprising both public assistance and SSI eligible persons requests an\nemergency shelter allowance, the social services district must compute the\namount of the allowance as follows: (i) determine the public assistance grant of the public assistance eligible persons\nusing the appropriate rent schedule amount in subdivision (a) of this\nsection; (ii)\ncalculate the net\namount of actual household shelter costs by subtracting the appropriate rent\nschedule amount, as determined by referring to subdivision (a) of this section, from the total actual household shelter costs; (iii)\ncalculate the maximum amount of\nemergency shelter allowance available to the household by subtracting the\nappropriate rent schedule amount, as determined by referring to subdivision (a)\nof this section, from the maximum allowance authorized by paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision for the total number of persons in the household; and\n(iv)\nsubtract the SSI and other income of the\nSSI eligible person only when such person is included as the first person in\nthe household, from the sum of the amount calculated in accordance with the\nprovisions of subparagraph (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph, whichever is less, and the incremental nonshelter public assistance standard of need of the SSI\neligible persons. The resulting amount, if greater than zero, is the\nhousehold's emergency shelter allowance. This allowance is added to the public\nassistance grant determined in accordance with subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (4)\n\nWhen\nnecessary, social services districts must: (i) address the social services needs of a person in receipt of an emergency\nshelter allowance through the direct provision of services or through the\nprovision of appropriate information and referral services; efforts should be\nmade to ensure that an applicant for or a recipient of such an allowance has\nestablished appropriate social and medical support networks; (ii)\nassist an applicant for or a recipient\nof an emergency shelter allowance to secure the required documentation so that\neligibility for such allowance can be determined; and\n(iii)\narrange for required face-to-face\ninterviews to be conducted during home visits or at other appropriate sites. In accordance with department regulations, designated\nrepresentatives may file and sign application and recertification documents on\nbehalf of an applicant for or a recipient of an emergency shelter\nallowance. (l) Shelter allowances in excess of the\nstandards. A shelter supplement plan under paragraph (a)(3) of this\nsection may include provisions for treatment of SSI family members that differ\nfrom the requirements of section\n352.2\n(b) of this\n\nPart, but only with respect to the shelter supplement and only if approved by\nthe office. (m) Inspection of shelter placements. Social services districts that make referrals for\ntemporary emergency shelter for eligible homeless households to temporary\nhousing units, which will be paid for by public funds, that are not otherwise\ngoverned by section\n460\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law, Parts 900 and 491 of this Title, or subdivision (h) of\nthis section, shall submit for approval by the Office of Temporary and\n\nDisability Assistance health and safety standards for those units which comport\nwith all applicable State and local laws, regulations, codes and ordinances. Additionally, social services districts shall be responsible for the inspection\nof such temporary housing units at least once every 12 months to confirm that\nsuch standards are satisfied. A written report shall be made of each such\ninspection and shall be maintained at the office of the social services\ndistrict together with such other information as the social services district\nmay maintain concerning the households placed in the temporary housing unit. A\ncopy of any such inspection report shall be provided to the Office of Temporary\nand Disability Assistance within 30 days of its completion. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
