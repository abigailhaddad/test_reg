  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 8-1.57 - Emergency release\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The emergency release shall be in the car, plainly visible to the occupants of\nthe car and reasonably, but not easily accessible to the operator. (b) To operate the car under emergency\nconditions it shall be necessary for the operator to hold the emergency release\nin the emergency position. The emergency release shall be so constructed and\ninstalled that it cannot be readily tampered with or \"plugged\" in the emergency\nposition or intentionally rendered inoperative. (c) Rods, connections and wiring used in the\noperation of the emergency release, that are accessible from the car, shall be\nenclosed to prevent being tampered with readily. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n8-1.57\n\nThese specifications cover the principal features\nwith which interlocks, electric contacts and emergency releases shall comply\nbefore they will receive the approval of the Industrial Commissioner. The\ntechnical fulfillment of these requirements does not assure the approval of a\ndevice if examination and test disclose a lack of practicability, durability or\nreliability. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
