Except as provided in section\n228-2.2\nof this Subpart, no person\nshall use, apply, solicit, require the use of, specify the application of, sell, supply, offer for sale, or manufacture for sale in the State of New York\nany commercial or industrial adhesive, sealant, adhesive primer or sealant\nprimer unless such adhesive, sealant, adhesive primer or sealant primer\ncomplies with the applicable VOC content limits specified in table 1 of this\nsubdivision and the applicable requirements of this Subpart. For adhesives\napplied to the listed substrates, the VOC content limits in table 1 of this\nsubdivision apply as follows: (1)\nif\nan operator uses a commercial or industrial adhesive or sealant subject to a\nspecific VOC content limit for such adhesive or sealant in table 1 of this\nsubdivision, such specific limit is applicable rather than an\nadhesive-to-listed-substrate limit; and\n(2)\nif an adhesive is used to bond dissimilar\nsubstrates together, the applicable substrate category with the highest VOC\ncontent shall be the limit for such use. Table 1.

Except as provided in section\n228-2.2\nof this Subpart, no person\nshall use or apply, solicit, require the use of or specify the application of\nany surface preparation or clean-up solvent within the State of New York if\nsuch use or application results in a violation of the provisions of this\n\nSubpart. Any person using a surface preparation or cleanup solvent\nshall: (1)\nexcept as provided in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision for single-ply roofing, limit the VOC content\nof surface preparation solvent used to less than 70 grams per liter; (2)\nif a surface preparation solvent is used\nin applying single-ply roofing, the composite vapor pressure, excluding water\nand exempt compounds, of the surface preparation solvent used, shall not exceed\n45 mm Hg at 20° C; (3)\nexcept as\nprovided in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, limit the composite vapor\npressure of a cleanup solvent to less than 45 mm Hg at 20° C; and\n(4)\nperform the removal of a commercial or\nindustrial adhesive, sealant, adhesive primer or sealant primer from the parts\nof spray application equipment as follows: (i) in an enclosed cleaning system, or equivalent cleaning system as determined by\nthe test method identified in section\n228-2.6\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart; (ii)\nusing a solvent with\na VOC content less than or equal to 70 grams of VOC per liter of material; and\n(iii)\nparts containing dried\nadhesive may be soaked in a solvent if the composite vapor pressure of the\nsolvent, excluding water and exempt compounds, is less than or equal to 9.5 mm\n\nHg at 20° C and the parts and solvent are in a closed container that remains\nclosed except when adding parts to or removing parts from the\ncontainer. (c) Emission control equipment. As an alternative to utilizing materials that comply with\nthe VOC content limits in subdivision (a) of this section, a person may achieve\ncompliance by using add-on air pollution control equipment if such equipment\nmeets the following requirements: (1)\nthe VOC emissions from the use of all adhesives, sealants, adhesive primers or\nsealant primers subject to this Subpart are reduced by an overall capture and\ncontrol efficiency of at least 85 percent, by weight; (2)\nthe combustion temperature is monitored\ncontinuously if a thermal oxidizer is operated; (3)\ninlet and exhaust gas temperatures are\nmonitored continuously if a catalytic oxidizer is operated; (4)\ncontrol device efficiency is monitored\ncontinuously if a carbon absorber or control device other than a thermal or\ncatalytic oxidizer is operated; and\n(5)\noperation records sufficient to\ndemonstrate compliance with the requirements of this subdivision are maintained\nas required by section\n228-2.5\nof this Subpart. (d) Work practices. Work practices shall be employed at facilities where the\ntotal actual VOC emissions from all industrial adhesive application processes, including related cleaning activities, equal or exceed three tons in a 12-month\nrolling period, before consideration of emission control equipment. Work practices\nshall include: (1)\nthe following types of application\nequipment, with the use of low-VOC adhesives or adhesive primers: electrostatic\nspray; HVLP spray; flow coat; roll coat or hand application, including\nnon-spray application methods similar to hand or mechanically powered caulking\ngun, brush, or direct hand application; dip coat (including electrodeposition); airless spray; air-assisted airless spray; any other adhesive application\nmethod, subject to department approval, capable of achieving a transfer\nefficiency equivalent to or better than that achieved by HVLP\nspraying; (2)\nthe following work\npractices for storage, mixing operations, and handling operations for\nadhesives, thinners, and adhesive-related waste materials that: (i) store all VOC-containing adhesives, adhesive primers, and process related waste materials in closed\ncontainers; (ii)\nensure that mixing\nand storage containers used for VOC-containing adhesives, adhesive primers, and\nprocess related waste materials are kept closed at all times except when\ndepositing or removing these materials; (iii)\nminimize spills of VOC-containing\nadhesives, adhesive primers, and process related waste materials; and\n(iv)\nconvey VOC-containing adhesives, adhesive primers, and process related waste materials from one location to\nanother in closed containers or pipes. (3)\nthe following work practices to reduce\nVOC emissions from cleaning materials used in industrial adhesive application\nprocesses that: (i) store all VOC-containing\ncleaning materials and used shop towels in closed containers; (ii)\nensure that storage containers used for\nVOC-containing materials are kept closed at all times except when depositing or\nremoving these materials; (iii)\nminimize spills of VOC-containing cleaning materials; (iv)\nconvey VOC-containing cleaning materials\nfrom one location to another in closed containers or pipes; and\n(v) minimize VOC emission from cleaning of\napplication, storage, mixing, and conveying equipment by ensuring that\nequipment cleaning is performed without atomizing the cleaning solvent and all\nspent solvent is captured in closed containers. (e) Process-specific RACT\ndemonstrations. (1)\n\nThe department may\nallow industrial adhesive application processes to operate with a lesser degree\nof control than is required by subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of this section, provided the applicant makes a process specific reasonably available control\ntechnology (RACT) demonstration to the satisfaction of the department. Such\nprocess-specific RACT demonstrations must address the technical and economic\nfeasibility of: (i) utilizing compliant\nadhesives, sealants and coatings; (ii)\nutilizing demonstrated and proven\nemission control technologies which would achieve the required overall removal\nefficiency determined pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section; (iii)\nutilizing demonstrated and proven\nemission control technologies which would achieve a level of overall removal\nefficiency less than the required level determined pursuant to subdivision (c)\nof this section; and\n(iv)\nutilizing\ndemonstrated and proven production modification methods which would result in\nreal, documented, and enforceable reductions in the VOC emissions from the\nprocess. (2)\n\nDepartment\napproved process-specific RACT demonstrations under this subdivision shall be\nsubmitted to the EPA administrator for approval as State Implementation Plan\nrevisions. Notes\nN.Y.
