  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 923.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In Table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters or portion thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in Table I shall mean that number or abbreviation assigned to any\ndesignated waters or portion thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage area, such\nas a river, large lake, bay or sound, is usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary river waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of primary lake, bay or sound\nwaters are consecutively numbered in a clockwise order from a defined point, usually the outlet of the primary waters. Subtributaries are numbered as\nencountered along the tributary proceeding from its mouth to the source, and in\nlike manner all of its other stream courses are so numbered. Ponds and lakes\nare numbered in the order they are encountered within the system. Tributaries\nof such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing\nclockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. The numbers\nassigned to such lakes and ponds are prefixed by the letter P. When isolated\nlakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for\nconvenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to\nwhich no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the waters\nunder consideration by the New York State Conservation Department in its\n\nBiological Survey of the Lower Hudson Watershed\nand\n\nBiological Survey of the Fresh Waters of Long Island\nin 1936\nand 1938, respectively, and has been closely followed in connection with the\nnumerical identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on the older maps employed by the Conservation Department at\nthe time of its 1936 and 1938 surveys but not shown on later editions of maps\nreproduced herein. Conversely, streams, lakes and ponds not shown on the older\nmaps but appearing on the newer maps are designated by suffix letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to\nthe identification of the designated waters may be outlined as follows: There\nare several primary indices used to identify the designated waters. Those\nwaters that drain Atlantic Ocean proper are identified by waters index numbers\nprefixed by the abbreviation AO. Waters draining to Shinnecock Bay are\nidentified by waters index numbers prefixed by the abbreviation SB. Waters of\n\nShinnecock Inlet, Quogue Canal, Quantuck Bay and Quantuck Canal are identified\nby SI, Qg-C, QB and Qt-C, respectively, prefixing the waters index\nnumbers. (4)\n\nThe following table\nwill illustrate how the designated waters may be identified through use of the\nwaters index system: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\nAO\nAtlantic Ocean\n\nPrimary waters identified by an abbreviation. SB\nShinnecock Bay\nSB-155\n\nPhillips Creek\n\nThe 155th tributary encountered on Long Island\nproceeding in a clockwise direction around the island from Fort Hamilton (The\n\nNarrows). SB-155-1\n\nStone Creek\n\nThe first tributary entering Phillips Creek above\nthe mouth. Qg-C-P 834\n\nOgden Pond\n\nThe 834th pond or lake encountered in the\nbiological survey area of the Atlantic Ocean-Long Island Sound watershed\n(c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs., indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, shall mean any stream, pond or\nother body of surface water which flows into any other stream, pond or other\nbody of surface water; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or\nsubtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include\nonly the stream, pond or other body of water referenced by such waters index\nnumber; where a tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are\nmentioned after the waters index number, the specifically designated waters\nshall include the stream, pond or other body of water referenced by such waters\nindex number and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on\nthe reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly\nstated. (d) Name\nas appearing in Table I shall mean the name by which the specifically\ndesignated waters are known and which name may appear on the reference maps. In\ncases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named waters to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary are identified as far as\npossible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designations of\nsegments or sections of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classification and standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in Table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which\nthe specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown. (1)\n\nThe following maps were produced from\noriginal maps which may be procured through the Washington Distribution\n\nSection, Geological Survey, Silver Spring, Maryland: Map Ref. No. Name of\nquadrangle\n\nEdition\n\nPublished by\nR-29a\n\nRiverhead\n1944\nU.S. Army\nR-29b\n\nMattituck\n1944\nU.S. Army\nR-29c\n\nEastport\n1944\nU.S. Army\nR-29d\n\nQuogue\n1943\nU.S. Army\nR-30a\n\nSouthampton\n1944\nU.S. Army\nR-30b\n\nSag Harbor\n1943\nU.S. Army\nR-30c\n\nShinnecock\n1944\nU.S. Army\n(2)\n\nIt is to be noted that Map 2, section\n923.6, infra, has\nbeen made by using maps R-30a, R-30b and R-30c and combining them into one map. Map 3, section\n923.7, infra, has\nbeen made by using maps R-29a, R-29b, R-29c, R-29d, R-30a and R-30c and\ncombining them into one map. (g) Class, as appearing in\n\nTable I and denoted by the letters B, C, SA, SB, SC and SD opposite each\nspecifically designated waters, shall mean Class B, C, SA, SB, SC and SD, as\nthe case may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra. (h) Standards, as appearing\nin Table I and denoted by the letters B, C, SA, SB, SC and SD opposite each\nspecifically designated waters, shall mean the quality standards established\nfor Class B, C, SA, SB, SC and SD, as the case may be, as set forth in Part\n701, supra. (i) The Shinnecock Bay - Mecox Bay drainage basin shall be deemed to include the\nfollowing areas: (1)\nthat portion of the\n\nAtlantic Ocean within the boundaries of New York State extending from a line\npassing due south through Potunk Point to a line passing due south at Ocean\n\nRoad, a distance of approximately 19.6 miles; (2)\nall of the Shinnecock Bay and Mecox Bay\nas defined in Table I included herein; and\n(3)\nall land and water areas which are\ndirectly or indirectly tributary to Shinnecock Bay or Mecox Bay. (j) Unless otherwise expressly\ndefined in Table I, the mouth of any stream or estuary shall be considered to\nbe represented by a continuation of the shoreline of the bay, cove, river, estuary or creek to which such stream or estuary is tributary across the\nchannel axis of such tributary stream or estuary. (k) All streams, ponds, estuaries or other\nbodies of water which appear as lines, to indicate natural waters, on the\nreference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in Table I, shall be assigned the same classes and standards of quality and purity as the\nspecifically designated waters to which they are directly tributary. (l) All streams, ponds, estuaries or other\nbodies of water which are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be\nassigned to Class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except\nthat any continuous flowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference\nmaps shall have the same classification and assigned standards as the waters to\nwhich it is directly tributary; or, if they be tidal salt waters, such waters\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to Class SD, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standard as the waters to which it is directly\ntributary.
