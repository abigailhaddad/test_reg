  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 601.8 - Program probation, monitoring, re-certification and performance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) During any 12\nmonth period, every active program must have at least one registered\napprentice. (b) Program probation. (1)\n\nNewly approved programs shall undergo a\ntwo year probation beginning on the first apprentice's start date or the\nprogram approval date, whichever comes later. Sponsors of newly approved\nprograms shall be advised that their programs are being approved contingent\nupon successful completion of probation. During probation, a sponsor may not\nsubmit any new program applications, nor change its approach. (2)\n\nThe performance of provisionally approved\nprograms shall be evaluated by the department during probation based upon the\nsponsor's and signatories' compliance with the following factors: (i) the continuous enrollment of an\napprentice(s); (ii)\nthe payment of\nwages as specified in the apprenticeship agreement, and the availability of\nsuch documentation for review by the department; (iii)\nverifiable documentation of task\nrotation and skill development; (iv)\nverifiable documentation of\nparticipation in related and supplemental instruction; (v) the proper supervision of apprentices, including maintenance of an appropriate ratio of apprentices to journeyworkers, and documentation that such ratios have been maintained on the\njobsite; (vi)\nthe provision of a\nsafe work environment as prescribed by the occupational safety and health act\n(OSHA) and the regulations thereto; (vii)\nthe terms and conditions/provisions as\nindicated on the program registration agreement; (viii)\nthe provisions of Labor Law, article\n23, this Part and Part 600 of this Title; and\n(ix)\narticles 8 and 9 of the Labor Law, the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law, and all other Federal or State laws governing the\nterms and conditions of employment. (3)\n\nProbation review options. (i) The department may cancel the\nregistration of any program at any point during probation for violating any of\nthe regulations contained in this Part. (ii)\n\nAfter a review of the new program's\nperformance during probation, the sponsor will be notified whether it: (a) passed probation; or\n(b) will have its probation extended for a\nperiod of no more than one year; or\n(c) failed probation. (iii)\nA sponsor of a program that has had its\nprobation extended pursuant to this section, or that has failed probation, shall be informed of the reasons why this decision was made. (iv)\nA sponsor whose program has been placed\non an extended probation shall be required to submit a proposed corrective\naction plan addressing the deficiencies identified in the notice and a proposed\ntime frame for its implementation. Both components of the proposed corrective\naction plan must receive department approval. (v) A sponsor whose program fails probation\nmay file a written appeal of the decision by sending a letter to the\ncommissioner within 30 days of written notification of the determination, setting forth the grounds for contesting the department's\ndetermination. (4)\n\nSponsors of programs whose registrations are cancelled during probation, deemed\nderegistered, or fail probation shall not reapply, seek reinstatement, or apply\nfor a new program for a period of one year following notification by the\ndepartment. This period additionally applies to applications for registration\nof any apprenticeship program by any owner, officer, successor or substantially\nowned-affiliated entity of/to the sponsor. (c) Program evaluation and monitoring. (1)\n\nEvery registered program will be\nmonitored periodically by the department for the quality of its performance in\nproviding apprenticeship training, including, but not limited to: (i) compliance with Federal and State\nlaws; (ii)\nproviding equal\nopportunity in employment; (iii)\ncompliance with department standards for apprenticeship programs as outlined in\nsection\n601.5\nof this Part; and\n(iv)\ncompletion rates: (a) For purposes of Federal reporting, completion rates shall be calculated annually by cohort (class of apprentices). (1)\n\nEach cohort's completion rate shall be\ncompared to the national average for completion rates as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. (2)\n\nApprentices who leave before the expiration of their probation shall not be\nincluded when calculating this completion rate. (3)\n\nPrograms with completion rates below the\nnational average shall be offered such technical assistance as may be\nrequired. (b) In\nevaluating a program's performance, the department shall not be limited to the\ncohort method of calculating completion rates, but may take into account\nadditional factors such as period of time over which rate is calculated, seasonality, regional differences, program size, and general economic\nconditions affecting employee retention. (2)\n\nTo the extent that correctable\ndeficiencies are found, the department shall offer technical assistance to the\nprogram sponsor as necessary to bring the program into compliance. If\nreasonable efforts to bring the program into compliance fail, or if the\ndeficiencies are such that the department does not find that they are\ncorrectable, the department shall seek program deregistration. (d) Re-certification. (1)\n\nAll apprenticeship programs shall undergo\na recertification process at or about the time that the program completes its\nfirst training cycle following program registration, and at least every five\nyears thereafter. (2)\n\nEach sponsor\nseeking re-certification shall complete an updated program registration\nagreement, sponsor information sheet, and update any other program information\nthat may be out of date. (3)\n\nSignatories. (i) Each sponsor of a group\njoint or group non-joint program shall submit a current list of program\nsignatories' names, addresses, and Federal employer identification numbers or\n\nNew York State unemployment insurance employer numbers in an electronic format\nas specified by the department. (ii)\n\nThe department must be notified of the\nassociation or disassociation of a signatory within 90 days, pursuant to\nsection\n601.5\n(g) of this\n\nPart. (iii)\n\nThe sponsor shall\nprovide assurances in writing to the department that the sponsor will hold all\nsignatories to the standards of their State program registration\nagreement. (4)\n\nEach\nsponsor undergoing re-certification must agree to comply with section\n601.4\n(a)(4)\nof\nthis Part, which forbids a sponsor from requiring an applicant to pay an\napplication, processing, or similar fee. (5)\n\nApplicants for all group programs (joint\nand non-joint) shall make available to the department signed copies of their\nunion collective bargaining agreements or group association membership\nagreements for review, upon request. Such agreements must include language that\nmakes the requirements on the program registration agreement applicable to\ntheir signatories, either in the terms of the agreement or in an ancillary\nagreement that is approved by the department. If the applicant does not have a\nwritten agreement with its signatories, it must submit the ancillary\ngroup-sponsor signatory agreement provided by the department. (6)\n\nBased on a review of the sponsor's\nperformance during the period prior to re-certification, the sponsor will\nreceive notification that: (i) the sponsor's\napprenticeship program has been renewed; or\n(ii)\nthe sponsor was found to have committed\nthe violations specified, and is required to submit a corrective action plan to\nthe department which addresses the deficiencies identified in the notice with a\nproposed time frame for the plan's implementation. Both components of the plan\nrequire department approval. Formal deregistration will be pursued if\ncorrective action is not approved by the department; or the sponsor has not\ntaken the approved corrective action to resolve all issues within a reasonable\nperiod of time approved by the department; or\n(iii)\nthe sponsor's apprenticeship program\nhas been recommended for deregistration, and the reasons therefor. (e) Programs with no\napprentices. (1)\n\nAny program, except programs\noperated by State agencies and those granted inactive status, that has not had\nan apprentice registered with the department for a period of 12 consecutive\nmonths shall be deemed deregistered. The department will follow up such\nderegistration with a letter acknowledging that the program has been\nderegistered. The letter will include the effects that such deregistration may\nhave on an employer and the effective date of the deregistration. In order for\na sponsor to reinstate a program which was deregistered under this section, the\nsponsor must reapply and meet all the requirements contained in article 23 of\nthe Labor Law, this Part and Part 600 of this Title. (2)\n\nNo later than 30 days before the\nconclusion of the 12 month period referred to in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, a sponsor, who would otherwise be \"deemed deregistered,\" may\nrequest that its program be placed in inactive status (inactive program). (i) The commissioner, in his/her discretion\nmay grant inactive status only to sponsors found to be in compliance with\narticle 23 of the Labor Law, this Part and Part 600 of this Title, and other\n\nState and Federal laws for the protection of workers. (ii)\n\nIf granted, inactive status shall run\nfrom the end of the 12 month period referred to in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (iii)\n\nAn employer who\nis associated with an inactive program shall not be deemed to have a registered\n\nNew York State program for purposes of work performed pursuant to articles 8, 8A, and 9 of the Labor Law. (iv)\n\nAn\ninactive program shall be deemed reactivated upon completion of all of the\nfollowing: (a) the registration of an\napprentice by filing an apprenticeship agreement; (b) the filing of newly updated sponsor\ninformation sheet and program registration agreement forms, and such other\nform(s) as the commissioner may require, by the sponsor; and\n(c) the review and approval of such forms by\nthe department. (v) After a period of 12 months of inactive status, inactive programs will be\ndeemed deregistered, unless this period is extended at the discretion of the\ncommissioner due to circumstances related to extended periods of unemployment, an economic downturn, or other circumstances warranting a longer period of\ntime. (vi)\n\nPrograms on probation\nare not eligible for inactive status. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
