  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 151.4 - Performance evaluation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Employees with 120 workdays in grade in fiscal year 1980-81 who are scheduled\nto be evaluated on April 1, 1981 for the period October 1, 1980 through March\n31, 1981 shall be evaluated on or about May 1, 1981 for the period February 1, 1981 through April 30, 1981. The April 1, 1981 through September 30, 1981\nevaluation period will be adjusted to reflect the modifications to the earlier\nevaluation period and consist of the period of May 1, 1981 through September\n30, 1981. Employees will be evaluated on or about October 1, 1981. Subsequent\nevaluations for such employees shall be conducted each six months thereafter. These adjustments do not affect employee eligibility for, or effective dates\nof, performance advances. Employees who change grades shall be evaluated after\nsix months of service in the new grade. New appointees shall be evaluated after\nsix months of service in grade. Subsequent evaluations shall be conducted after\neach six months of service in grade. (b) Supervisors shall evaluate eligible\nemployees against a written performance program comprised of objectives, tasks\nand standards established by the supervisor upon review and approval of the\nreviewer. The approved performance program must be given and thoroughly\nexplained to the employee at the onset of the evaluation period. The employee\nmay attach written comments concerning the program; however, such comments\nshall serve as a formal expression of the employee's point of view and not a\nchange of the performance program. Upon completion of the six-month evaluation\nperiod, the supervisor shall evaluate the employee's actual performance against\nthe standards in the evaluation program. (c) Based upon the content of the evaluation\nreport, the employee shall receive one of the following performance ratings to\nreflect a summary description of the employee's overall performance: (1)\n\nEffective. The employee has successfully\nachieved the objectives or performed the tasks specified in the performance\nprogram. It is only when the employee's performance clearly shows\naccomplishments above or below this expected performance level that a rating\nother than effective should be considered. In the upper range of this category, the employee always meets and sometimes exceeds performance standards. In the\nmiddle range, which is the expected and usual level of performance for most\nemployees, the employee meets all performance standards effectively and\nefficiently. In the lower range, the employee meets performance standards at a\nminimally acceptable level; some assignments may require extra direction by the\nsupervisor, or the supervisor may find it necessary to avoid assigning the more\ndifficult tasks or responsibilities to the employee. (2)\n\nOutstanding. The employee's performance\nis clearly exceptional in comparison with performance standards specified in\nthe performance program. The performance consistently exceeds the requirements\nfor all the tasks, assignments or activities, and the objectives which were to\nbe accomplished during the evaluation period. The employee can be relied upon\nto perform the most difficult assignments and has made exceptional\ncontributions to the work of the unit. (3)\n\nBelow minimum. The employee has failed to\nmeet one or more of the performance standards specified in the performance\nprogram. The employee cannot be relied upon to carry out critical assignments\nin a timely or effective fashion. There is a need for immediate and significant\nimprovement in performance. The evaluation report must be reviewed and approved by the\nreviewer before it is given to the employee. Upon approval of the reviewer, the\nevaluation report is final, except for recommended performance advances for\nemployees subject to the variable rate payment system. (d) Employees covered by the\nprovisions of this Part must be on the payroll at the time of rating. Eligible\nemployees who have 120 workdays in grade in fiscal year 1980-81 and who are off\nthe payroll at the time of the rating shall be evaluated upon return to their\nposition in regular full-pay status. Employees who do not have 120 workdays in\ngrade in fiscal year 1980-81 who are off the payroll or in less than regular\nfull-pay status for a full payroll period or more shall not have such payroll\nperiod or periods included in the rating period. When an employee is off the\npayroll or in less than regular full-pay status for a full payroll period or\nmore, the employee's rating period is to be extended by the same amount of time\n(in multiples of full payroll periods).
