  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 219-2.7 - Continuous emission monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person who owns or operates a facility subject to these requirements must\ninstall and operate, prior to operation of the facility and in accordance with\nmanufacturer's instructions, instruments acceptable to the commissioner for\ncontinuously monitoring the following emission and operating parameters: (1)\nopacity; (2)\nsulfur dioxide; (3)\nhydrogen chloride; (4)\nnitrogen oxides; (5)\ncarbon monoxide; (6)\ncarbon dioxide; (7)\noxygen; (8)\ntemperature; and\n(9)\ncombustion index. Monitoring instruments for continuously measuring opacity\nand concentrations of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and oxygen will be\nsubject to Performance Specifications 1 (opacity), 2 (SO\n2\nand NO\nx\n) and 3 (O\n2\nand CO\n2\n) set forth in title 40\nCFR part\n60, Appendix B (see section\n200.9\nof this Title). (b) The requirement for\nhydrogen chloride (HCl) monitoring may be waived upon a satisfactory\ndemonstration by the applicant that HCl cannot be monitored reliably at the\nfacility and provided that an alternative monitoring procedure acceptable to\nthe commissioner is implemented. Final determination of reliability will be\nmade by the commissioner. If hydrogen chloride monitors are not installed\ninitially, the commissioner may require installation in the future should such\nmonitoring subsequently be determined feasible and necessary. (c) A report indicating continuous emission\nmonitoring equipment locations, as well as specifications, and procedures for\ncalibration, operation, maintenance, and data evaluation and reporting must be\nsubmitted to the commissioner at least 90 days prior to installation of such\nequipment. This report must be distributed as set forth in section\n219-2.6\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart and must be approved by the commissioner prior to equipment\ninstallation. (d) A file of the\nemission and operating parameter measurements required by this section and\nother operating parameters specified in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this\nsubdivision, and any additional parameters required by the commissioner as a\nresult of new technology or information, must be maintained. Each permittee for\na source subject to this Subpart will, where applicable, following each\ncalendar quarter, tabulate and summarize emission and operating parameter\nmeasurements, and the following operating parameters, recorded during the\npreceding three months. Such quarterly summaries must be submitted as set forth\nin section\n219-2.6\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter in a format\nacceptable to the commissioner: (1)\nsteam\ntemperature in degrees F, steam pressure in pounds per square inch absolute and\nsteam flow in pounds per hour (hourly average); (2)\nhourly auxiliary fuel use per furnace in\ngallons per hour for fuel oil and cubic feet per hour for gaseous\nfuel; (3)\nfor electrostatic\nprecipitators: (i) current flow per field in\namperes; (ii)\napplied voltage per\nfield; (iii)\nsparking rate per\nfield; (iv)\nhourly average\ntemperature at both inlet and-outlet of the device in degrees F; and\n(v) frequency and duration of maintenance or\ncleaning periods when the precipitator is not fully operational; (4)\nfor fabric filters: (i) hourly average pressure drop across each\nmodule and also across the inlet and outlet of the entire device in inches of\nwater; (ii)\nnumber of compartments\nin use, hourly; (iii)\nhourly\naverage temperature at both inlet and outlet of the device in degrees F; and\n(iv)\nfrequency and duration of\nmaintenance or cleaning periods when the fabric filter is not fully\noperational; (5)\nfor\ngaseous contaminant emission control devices: (i) hourly average pressure drop across\ndevice in inches of water; (ii)\nhourly average temperature at both inlet and outlet of the device in degrees\nF; (iii)\nreagent chemicals used in\npounds per hour by chemical; (iv)\nwater use in gallons per hour; and\n(v) frequency, duration, and description of\nperiods when the device is not fully operational. (e) Records and summaries of all\nmeasurements and operating parameters must be retained for at least three\nyears, and made available upon request of the commissioner or his\nrepresentative within 10 working days from receipt of the request. (f) The quarterly summary of emissions and\noperating parameters required by this section will be forwarded to the\ndepartment and other agencies identified in section\n219-2.6\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. (g) Excess emissions and/or out of compliance\noperating parameters must be reported to the appropriate regional air pollution\ncontrol engineer within one working day of occurrence, along with a program for\nimmediate correction of these conditions. (h) All reports required by this Subpart must\ninclude a section on data quality control and quality assurance. A plan for\ndata quality control and quality assurance must be submitted 90 days prior to\napplication for any certificate to operate and approved by the commissioner\nprior to issuance of the certificate to operate pursuant to Part 201 of this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n219-2.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
