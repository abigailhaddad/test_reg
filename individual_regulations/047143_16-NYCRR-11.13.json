  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 11.13 - Meter readings and estimated bills\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A utility may render an estimated bill for any billing period if: (1)\nthe estimated bill is calculated in\naccordance with a procedure approved by the commission and clearly states that\nit is based on an estimated reading; and\n(2)\nthe distribution utility has made a\nreasonable effort to obtain an actual meter reading; or\n(3)\ncircumstances beyond the control of the\ndistribution utility made an actual reading of the meter extremely\ndifficult; (4)\ncircumstances\nindicate a reported reading is likely to be erroneous; (5)\nan estimated reading has been prescribed\nor authorized by the commission for a billing period between periods when\nactual meter readings were scheduled; or\n(6)\nthe customer is a seasonal or short-term\ncustomer, as those terms are defined in section\n11.12\n(a) of this\n\nPart. For such customers, an actual meter reading shall be taken upon\ndisconnection or suspension of service. (b) When a utility has rendered estimated\nbills to a residential customer for a period of four months or two billing\nperiods, whichever is greater, the distribution utility shall take reasonable\nactions to obtain an actual meter reading. Such actions may include, but are\nnot limited to: (1)\nmaking an appointment with\nthe customer or such other person who controls access to the meter for the\nreading at a time other than during normal business hours; (2)\noffering the customer the opportunity to\nphone in a meter reading; or\n(3)\nproviding a card to the customer on which he or she may record the reading and\nmail it to the distribution utility. (c) When a distribution utility has not\nobtained an actual meter reading after bills representing six months or three\nbilling periods of estimated bills, whichever is greater, have been rendered, it shall, unless otherwise authorized by the commission, send a notice to the\ncustomer and to the person who controls access to the meter offering a special\nappointment for a meter reading both during and outside of business\nhours. (d) If the distribution\nutility receives no response after bills representing eight months or four\nbilling periods, whichever is greater, it may send another letter advising the\nrecipients that if no appointment is made, a charge not to exceed $25 will be\nadded to the next bill rendered to the person who controls and refuses to\nprovide access, but that no charge will be imposed if an appointment is\narranged and kept. (e) If the\nperson who controls access fails to arrange an appointment in response to a\nsecond request and the distribution utility is unable to obtain a meter\nreading, it may add a charge not to exceed $25 to the bill of such person. If\nthe distribution utility intends to obtain a court order to gain access to the\nmeter, it shall so inform such person, by certified or registered letter. The\nletter shall state that the purpose of obtaining such a court order is to\nreplace a meter or, if physically feasible, to relocate the meter or install a\nremote reading device. The letter shall state that the court costs and the\ncosts of relocation will be paid by the person who controls access to the\nmeter. (f) Where a utility has\nsubmitted an estimated bill or bills to a residential customer that understate\nthe actual amount of money owed by such customer for the period when estimated\nbills were rendered by more than 50 percent or $100, whichever is greater, the\nutility shall notify the customer in writing that he or she has the right to\npay the difference between the estimated charges and the actual charges in\nregular monthly installments tailored to the customer's financial circumstances\nover a reasonable period. (g) The\ncommission may grant distribution utilities waivers from the requirements of\nsubdivisions (c)-(e) of this section upon a showing of good cause. Waivers\npreviously granted utilities in Case 26629, to the extent not inconsistent with\nsubdivisions (a), (b) and (f) of this section, shall remain in full force and\neffect. (h) Each utility shall\nestablish procedures for carrying out the requirements of this section and\nshall submit such procedures and any subsequent amendments to the commission\nfor approval. A utility may establish other reasonable procedures designed to\nreduce the number of estimated bills that do not conflict with the requirements\nof this section. (i) Where a\ndistribution utility gains access to a gas meter through the use of a court\norder but cannot restore full service because the terms of the court order do\nnot permit the distribution utility access to all areas of the premises to\nrelight pilot lights, the distribution utility shall lock the meter. The\ndistribution utility shall leave written notification informing the customer\nhow service can be promptly restored. If the customer fails to contact the\ndistribution utility to have service restored, the distribution utility shall\nattempt to contact the customer, on no less than a weekly basis, until such\nservice is restored. During the period November 1st to April 15th, inclusive, court orders obtained under this section shall not be enforced against any\nresidential gas-heating customer if such enforcement would result in the\ndisconnection of service or in an unsafe condition. (j) A duly authorized agent of the\ndistribution utility may enter any residential dwelling supplied with service\nby the utility at all reasonable times for the purpose of reading a meter to\nascertain the quantity of gas or electricity supplied, provided such agent\nexhibits a photo-identification badge and written authority as prescribed in\nsection\n65\n(9)\nof the Public Service Law.
