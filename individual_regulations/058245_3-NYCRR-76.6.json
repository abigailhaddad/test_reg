  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 76.6 - Assessment area delineation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In general. A banking institution shall\ndelineate one or more assessment areas within which the Banking Department\nevaluates the banking institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs\nof its community. The Banking Department does not evaluate the banking\ninstitution's delineation of its assessment area(s) as a separate performance\ncriterion, but the Banking Department reviews the delineation for compliance\nwith the requirements of this section. (b) Geographic area(s) for wholesale or\nlimited purpose banking institutions. The assessment area(s) for wholesale or\nlimited purpose banking institutions must consist generally of one or more MSAs\nor metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries\nthat were in effect as of January 1st of the calendar year in which the\ndelineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as\ncounties, cities, or towns, in which the bank has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking ATMs. (c) Geographic area(s) for other banking institutions. The assessment area(s) for a\nbanking institution other than a wholesale or limited purpose banking\ninstitution must: (1)\nconsist generally of\none or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan\ndivision boundaries that were in effect as of January 1st of the calendar year\nin which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political\nsubdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns; and\n(2)\ninclude the geographies in which the\nbanking institution has its main office, its branches, and its deposit-taking\nATMs, as well as the surrounding geographies in which the banking institution\nhas originated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home\nmortgage loans, small business and small farm loans, and any other loans the\nbanking institution chooses, such as those consumer loans on which the banking\ninstitution elects to have its performance assessed). (d) Adjustments to geographic area(s). A\nbanking institution may adjust the boundaries of its assessment area(s) to\ninclude only the portion of a political subdivision that it reasonably can be\nexpected to serve. An adjustment is particularly appropriate in the case of an\nassessment area that otherwise would be extremely large, of unusual\nconfiguration, or divided by significant geographic barriers. (e) Limitations on the delineation of an\nassessment area. Each banking institution's assessment area(s): (1)\nmust consist only of whole\ngeographies; (2)\nmay not reflect\nillegal discrimination; (3)\nmay not\narbitrarily exclude low- or moderate-income geographies, taking into account\nthe banking institution's size and financial condition; and\n(4)\nmust delineate separate assessment areas\nfor the areas served by the banking institution in each state in those\ninstances in which a banking institution serves a geographic area that extends\nsubstantially beyond a state boundary. (f) Use of assessment area(s). The Department\nuses the assessment area(s) delineated by a banking institution in its\nevaluation of the banking institution's CRA performance unless the Department\ndetermines that the assessment area(s) do not comply with the requirements of\nthis section.
