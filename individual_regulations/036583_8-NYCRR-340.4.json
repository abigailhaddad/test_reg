The accounting system shall provide a\nmeans to record transactions respecting collection and disbursement of clinical\npractice income, including but not limited to such transactions involving a\nplan member, department, school of medicine or dentistry, College of Optometry, health sciences center, or medical center. All accounts shall be available at\nany reasonable time for inspection by the chancellor, or designee, the chief\nadministrative officer, or designee, and representatives of the State Division\nof the Budget and Department of Audit and Control. Monthly reports shall be\nforwarded to the office of the vice chancellor for finance and business as\ndetermined by that office. The governing board shall provide copies of the\nannual audit to plan members at least once each year. The governing board, or\nin the case of a plan organized along departmental lines, the department, shall\nprovide each plan member an account of the amounts billed and collected as a\nresult of the plan member's clinical practice and a summary of those accounts\nfor which payment has not been received. Any professional or academic employee\nwho is a plan member may authorize, on his or her behalf, the duly certified\nemployee organization representing the Professional Services Negotiating Unit\nto request such information no more frequently than twice each year. Each plan\nmember shall be required annually to provide such data as may be necessary for\nthe institution to comply with the appropriate sections of the Public Health\n\nLaw. Where clinical practice at an institution is organized along departmental\nlines the chancellor shall approve a departmental billing system if the\nchancellor determines it adequately complies with the above standards. In no\nevent shall individual plan members be permitted to bill directly for fees for\nprofessional services. (e) Auditing. All accounts shall be audited annually by independent auditing firms\nchosen by the governing boards to determine whether the operations of each plan\nfor the management of clinical practice have been conducted in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, the provisions of the plan for the\nmanagement of clinical practice and supplementary guidelines for disbursement\nof clinical practice income developed by a governing board. (f) Maximum allowable compensation. At least\nonce annually, the chief administrative officer or designee shall provide to\neach employee who is required to be a member of a clinical practice plan a\nstatement in writing which sets forth the maximum allowable compensation which\nsuch employee may earn from all sources, including State basic annual salary, clinical practice income as previously defined, salary from an affiliated\nhospital and research grants, but excluding royalties, honoraria and income\nunrelated to patient care; provided, however, that compensation from a research\nsponsor shall be subject to the regulations of the sponsor. Such maximum\nallowable compensation shall be arrived at by the chief administrative officer\nor designee after consultation with the employee, the employee's department\nchairperson and the dean, and after considering the employee's present\ncommitments and future goals in teaching, patient care and research, as well as\nthe amount of clinical practice income attributable or likely to be\nattributable to the employee. With due consideration of the factors stated\nabove, an employee's maximum allowable compensation shall not be unreasonably\nfixed at less than 250 percent of maximum State basic annual salary for the\nemployee's rank when clinical practice income attributable to the employee, or\navailable to the employee under provisions of a plan for management of clinical\npractice, permits maximum allowable compensation to be fixed at such\npercentage. Except as specifically provided hereafter, the maximum allowable\ncompensation may not exceed 250 percent of the maximum State basic annual\nsalary for a member's rank. In special circumstances relating to recruitment of\nemployees, the chief administrative officer or designee may authorize a newly\nrecruited employee who is required to be a member to receive more than 250\npercent of the maximum salary for such member's rank, if in the chief\nadministrative officer's judgment the best interest of the institution is\nserved, but in no event shall this authorization extend beyond the first two\nyears of such member's employment. With the approval of the chancellor, or\ndesignee, the maximum allowable compensation of individual plan members may be\nincreased to 275 percent of the maximum State basic annual salary. In\nexceptional cases related to the retention of physicians in difficult to retain\nspecialties, the employee's maximum allowable compensation may exceed 275\npercent with the approval of the chancellor or designee. In making such\nrecommendations, the chief administrative officer shall give due consideration\nto the competition for individuals in the particular specialty as indicated by\nthe Association of the American Medical Colleges' compensation data, and the\nhospital and other revenue generated by the employee's clinical activities. Such exceptions shall not exceed five percent of the total number of physicians\non a system wide basis. The State shall pay fringe benefits only on the State\nbasic annual salary. With the approval of the chief administrative officer or\ndesignee, the State and the certified representative of employees in the\n\nProfessional Services Negotiating Unit, members of a clinical practice\nmanagement plan at each school may elect by majority vote an alternate\ncompensation method in which case plan members may be permitted to earn and\nretain amounts generated which exceed 200 percent of the maximum allowable\n\nState salary for such member's rank; provided, however, that 50 percent of such\namounts authorized to be earned above the 200 percent level shall be paid into\nthe fund in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. With the approval of the\nchancellor, or designee, individual members of plans which have adopted the\nalternate compensation method may be permitted to earn and retain amounts which\nexceed 225 percent of the maximum allowable State salary for such member's\nrank; provided, however, that 50 percent of such amounts authorized to be\nearned above the 225 percent level shall be paid into the fund in paragraph\n(g)(1) of this section. If selected, the alternate method shall be in lieu of\nthe method of compensation first described in this subdivision. After an\napproved clinical practice plan has been fully operational for a period of 12\nmonths, the members of the plan may, subject to the approval of the chancellor, State and the certified representative of employees in the Professional\n\nServices Negotiating Unit, elect by majority vote to change the method of\ncompensation initially selected; provided, however, the methods of compensation\nare limited to the two methods provided in this subdivision. (g) Disbursement of clinical practice income. Provisions for disbursement of clinical practice income shall provide for the\nfollowing in order of priority: (1)\n\nFive\npercent of the gross clinical practice income from each plan for the management\nof clinical practice shall be deposited into a fund at the school of medicine\nor dentistry or College of Optometry whose plan members generated the income to\nbe administered by the chief administrative officer, or designee, for the\nbenefit of the school of medicine or dentistry, or College of Optometry; provided, however, that $60,000 of such funds, which shall be collected\nproportionately based on the amount of gross clinical practice income generated\nby each of the plans, shall be available for university-wide health sciences\npurposes. (2)\n\nThe State shall be\nreimbursed for the costs of clinical practice experienced by it as a\nconsequence of clinical practice by plan members which are regular and\ncustomary costs of a practitioner, not a hospital, including but not limited to\nuse of facilities, personnel, supplies and equipment. Reimbursement to the\n\nState for the costs of clinical practice will be made pursuant to a formula\nestablished by the chief administrative officer in consultation with the\ngoverning board of the practice plan and approved by the chancellor in\nconsultation with the Governor's Office of Employee Relations. Such funds will\nbe deposited into the Debt Service/State University Income Fund for transfer to\nthe respective hospital operations IFR accounts. Affiliate institutions may be\nreimbursed with the approval of the chancellor or designee for appropriately\ndocumented costs of clinical practice experienced by them as a consequence of\nclinical practice by plan members which are regular and customary costs of a\npractitioner, not a hospital, including but not limited to use of facilities, personnel, supplies and equipment. (3)\n\nPayment of all other costs of clinical\npractice determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\nand allowable to a practitioner as a deductible cost or expense under current\n\nFederal Internal Revenue Service guidelines. (4)\n\nEmployees required to participate in a\nplan for the management of clinical practice may be paid an amount from\nclinical practice income which, together with compensation from all other\nsources (exclusive of fringe benefits), does not exceed the maximum allowable\ncompensation arrived at in consultation with the chief administrative officer\nor designee, dean, department chairperson and the employee, or such excess\namounts authorized by the chief administrative officer or designee pursuant to\nsubdivision (f) of this section; provided, however, that no disbursements from\nclinical practice income for compensation of a plan member may be made where\nsuch income was not earned by the member unless there is specific provision for\nsuch disbursement in the plan for the management of clinical\npractice. (5)\n\nAn amount (not to\nexceed the rate the State University contributes for retirement to TIAA-CREF)\nof the cash payment made under paragraph (4) of this subdivision to the\nemployee from clinical practice income may be used to purchase an annuity; provided, however, that any portion of such cash payment on which retirement\ncontributions have already been made shall be excluded from the calculation to\nbe made herein. (6)\n\nRemaining\nclinical practice income shall remain in a school of medicine or dentistry or\n\nCollege of Optometry, and shall be used for the benefit of the school of\nmedicine or dentistry, College of Optometry, or departments thereof, as\ndetermined by the chief administrative officer, or designee, after consultation\nwith the governing board.
