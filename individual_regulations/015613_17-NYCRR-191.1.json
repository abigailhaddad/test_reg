  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 191.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Child Safety Transportation Act of 1992 (Chapters 69\nand 403 of the Laws of 1992) as amended by Chapter 623 of the Laws of 2021\nallows school districts to transport students for distances less than the\nstatutory transportation distance requirements. These guidelines have been\ndeveloped in consultation with the State Education Department, the Department\nof Motor Vehicles, and the Division of State Police in order to identify\nconditions under which walking to and from school may endanger the safety of\nchildren. Using these guidelines, school districts can authorize the\nestablishment of a child safety zone. There are five basic types of safety hazards students may\nencounter while walking to school: Highways without sidewalks or adequate shoulders, Highway intersections, Highway-railroad grade crossings, Violent crime statistics, and\n\nDensity of vacant buildings or structures. The guidelines identify factors for each of these types of\nhazards. These factors, each with assigned point values, are added together to\ndetermine if a hazardous zone exists. If the total points equal or exceed the\nvalues as set forth in section\n191.4\nof this Part, then the\nschool district may choose to create a child safety zone. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n191.1\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register October 4, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 40, eff. 10/4/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
