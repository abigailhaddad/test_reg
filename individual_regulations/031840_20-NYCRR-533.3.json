  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 533.3 - Returns\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1136, 1137-A, 1251\n(a) General. (1)\n\nEvery person who is required to register\nwith the Department of Taxation and Finance, or who voluntarily registers, is\nrequired to file returns in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. Returns must be made on forms prescribed by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. It is the department's practice to mail preaddressed sales and use tax\nreturns to registered vendors and it is preferable that such preaddressed\nreturns be used. If a preaddressed return is not received by a person required\nto file, it is such person's responsibility to obtain a return from the\ndepartment. No registrant is excused from liability for failure to report and\npay the tax because he has failed to receive a preaddressed return form. Filing\nmay be on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis in accordance with the\nprovisions of sections\n1136\nand\n1137-A\nof the Tax Law and this\nsection. (2)\n\nReturns are to be\nfiled in accordance with the instructions provided by the department. (3)\n\nSole proprietors must file returns in the\nbusiness name as it appears on the certificate of authority. (4)\n\nPartnerships, including joint ventures, must file returns in the business name as it appears on the certificate of\nauthority. (5)\n\nReturns for a single\nvendor, with more than one location, are to be filed on a consolidated basis. However, a vendor may request, in writing, approval to file separately for each\nbusiness location. Any vendor who at the effective date of this Part has been\nfiling returns separately for separate locations must continue to do so. The\nmethod of filing shall not be changed without prior written approval. The total\ntaxable receipts and purchases subject to use tax at all locations are to be\nincluded in total receipts for purposes of determining the obligation to file\nmonthly, regardless of whether the filing is on a consolidated or single\nlocation basis. (6)\n\nAll returns\nmust be accompanied by payment of the full amount due (see section\n533.4\nof this Part). Failure to pay the tax due with the return may result in the\nissuance of a notice and demand. However, whether or not a notice and demand is\nissued, the department may proceed with the remedies provided in section\n1141 (a)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (7)\n\nEvery return filed must\ncontain a full, complete and accurate disclosure of the information required, and shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions provided by the\ndepartment and pursuant to this section. If a return does not fully disclose\nthe required information, it may be considered incorrect or insufficient, and\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance may determine the tax due as provided in\nsection\n1138\nof the Tax Law. See section\n533.2\n(g) of this Part for provisions relating to incorrect or insufficient\nreturns. (8)\n\nAny person failing to\nfile a return required by sections\n1136\nand\n1137-A\nof the Tax Law, may be\nsubject to the criminal penalties prescribed by section\n1817\nof the Tax Law. (b) Part quarterly filing. Part quarterly is hereinafter referred to as\nmonthly. Every person required to register whose taxable\nreceipts, amusement charges, rents, and purchases subject to use tax, total\n$300,000 or more in any quarter of the preceding four quarters must file a\nmonthly return each month. This monthly return shall be long-form unless a\nperson is eligible to use, and elects to use the short form. Paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision discusses the long-form, and the short-form is discussed in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. In both long form filing and short form\nfiling, the monthly return for the third month of a quarter must be combined\nwith the quarterly return as a single return. (1)\n\nLong-form. A long-form return is based on the actual figures for each\nmonth. Monthly long-form returns shall be filed on or before the 20th day of\nthe month following the month for which the tax is due. A properly completed\nmonthly long-form return must be prepared in accordance with the instructions\nprovided by the Department of Taxation and Finance. It shall include completed\nschedules, if required. The return must show: (i) the name, address and identification\nnumber of the vendor, recipient of amusement charges or operator of a\nhotel; (ii)\ngross amount, to the\nnearest whole dollar, of sales of tangible personal property and services, food\nand drink, amusement charges and rents; (iii)\namount, to the nearest whole dollar, of\ntaxable sales of tangible personal property and services, food and drink, amusement charges and rents; (iv)\namount, to the nearest whole dollar, of purchases subject to use tax; (v) amount of sales and use taxes; (vi)\ncredits claimed and prepayments, if\nany; (vii)\nsales and use taxes\ndue; (viii)\nlate filing charge, penalties and interest, if any, and total amount due; (ix)\nthe signature of the vendor, officer or\nemployee of the vendor signing the return and the individual's title; (x) the signature and address of a preparer, if other than the vendor; and\n(xi)\nthe date prepared. The quarterly return serves as a monthly return for the\nlast month of a quarter and a reconciliation for the quarter. A properly\ncompleted quarterly return shall be prepared in accordance with the\ninstructions provided. It shall include completed schedules, if required. It\nshall include the same information as in the monthly return, except that\nsubparagraph (vi) of this paragraph shall include credits claimed, amount\nremitted on monthly return for the first two months in a quarter, and\nprepayment, if any. (2)\n\nShort-form. Persons who are required to file a monthly return may elect\nto use a monthly return, short-form, only if they have filed returns for each\nof the four quarters immediately preceding the month covered. The short-form\nmethod requires the taxpayer to file two monthly returns and a quarterly\nreconciling return. An amount equal to one third of the total amount of the tax\npaid in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, adjusted for rate\nchanges, is to be paid for each of the first two months of the quarter. For the\nthird and final month of the quarter, a quarterly return must be filed\nreporting actual figures for the quarter. On this quarterly return credit may\nbe taken for amounts paid in the previous two months. Monthly short-form\nreturns must be filed on or before the 20th day of the month following the\nmonth for which the tax is due.

(3)\n\nThe\nquarterly return serves as a monthly return for the last month of a quarter and\na reconciliation for the quarter.

(2)\n\nAny person\nrequired to file quarterly returns whose total tax due for the four most recent\nquarterly periods for which data is available for such person within the most\nrecent six quarters for which data is available did not exceed $3,000 may file\na return annually in lieu of filing quarterly. (3)\n(i) Each year, the department will review its records in order to identify persons\nwho may have become eligible to file annual returns.

Such a\nnotice will include: (a) the effective date\nand period for which the person's first annual return will be required to be\nfiled; and\n(b) instructions as to\nwhen the person's last quarterly return is required to be filed.

Annual returns must then be filed for the next and subsequent annual periods\nsucceeding this last quarterly period. (iii)\n\nQuarterly filers electing to file\nannually who are reclassified to annual filers after the date on which an\nannual period has begun must report their sales and use tax activities for that\nentire annual period and may claim a credit for taxes paid with any quarterly\nreturns previously filed during such annual period.
