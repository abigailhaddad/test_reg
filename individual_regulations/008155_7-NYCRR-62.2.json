  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 62.2 - Absence with pay\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. (1)\n\nAll Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall, so far as practicable, be allowed as days\noff. Employees required to work on any of these days shall not be entitled to\ncompensatory time off in lieu thereof. (2)\n\nThe days prescribed as holidays by the\ndepartment's annual calendar for the school year shall be observed as\nholidays. (b) Floating\ndays off. (1)\n\nThere will be three \"floating\ndays\" added to the school calendar. These days will be established as the first\nthree calendar days of the school year. Establishment of less than three\nfloating days will occur only through local labor/management agreement. However, in no instance shall there be more than three floating days. These\nfloating days are earned-days and will only be credited to the employee if they\nare worked. Employees paid on an hourly basis (as opposed to an annual-funded\nbasis) are not credited with floating days as they receive pay rather than time\nfor working those days. (2)\n\nThe\nfloating days credited cannot carry over from year to year. (3)\n\nSince employees may not be compensated in\ncash for floating days off, it is necessary that such time off be scheduled\nprior to separation from their teacher/vocational instructor/education\nsupervisor position. (4)\n\nNo teacher\nwill work more than 185 days during the school year. Floating days shall be\nused no later than June 10th. (5)\n\nEmployees unable to work any of the designated floating days shall notify the\nfacility prior to the start of the workday. Employee absences taken on floating\ndays will not be charged against accruals. (6)\n\nThese extra days off are to be recorded\nin a separate leave category and are to be used in full-day units. (7)\n\nRequests for floating days off will be\nmade, in writing, and will be subject to supervisor's approval. Such requests\nwill not be unreasonably denied. Responses to requests for floating days off\nwill be given within three days. (c) Absences during school year. Except as\nprovided by these rules and except as provided by the department's annual\ncalendar for the school year, employees shall not be entitled to any leave of\nabsence with pay during the school year; provided, however, that the department\nmay grant time off with pay for religious observance, teacher conferences and\nother appropriate professional meetings, and for extraordinary or emergency\nabsences. Employees may be required to make up such time off by appropriate\nadjustments in their daily or weekly work schedules. (d) Sick leave. (1)\n\nSick leave is absence with pay\nnecessitated by the illness or disability of the employee, including illness or\ndisability caused by pregnancy or childbirth. (2)\n\nEmployees shall earn sick leave credits\nat the rate of one-half day per biweekly pay period during periods they are\npaid their regular salary and may accumulate such credits up to a total of 150\ndays; provided, however, that an employee shall not earn sick leave credit for\nany biweekly pay period unless he is in full pay status for at least seven\nworkdays during such biweekly pay period. A part-time employee who is required\nto work a fixed number of hours, five days per week, shall also earn sick leave\ncredit as provided herein, but his total pay when absent on such leave shall be\nthe amount which would have been due him had he been working regularly at his\nusual hours for such period. (3)\n\nAn\nemployee absent on sick leave shall notify his supervisor of such absence and\nthe reason therefor on the first day of such absence and within two hours after\nthe beginning of the employee's workday; provided, however, that where the work\nis such that a substitute may be required, the department may require earlier\nnotification, but not more than two hours prior to the beginning of the\nemployee's workday. An employee who fails to so notify his supervisor may be\ndeemed to be on leave without pay for that day. Sick leave credits shall not be\nused in units of less than one-half hour. (4)\n\nBefore absence for personal illness may\nbe charged against accumulated sick leave credits, the department may require\nsuch proof of illness as may be satisfactory to it, or may require the employee\nto be examined, at the expense of the department, by a physician designated by\nthe department. In the event of failure to submit proof of illness upon\nrequest, or in the event that, upon such proof as is submitted or upon the\nreport of medical examination, the department finds that there is not\nsatisfactory evidence of illness sufficient to justify the employee's absence\nfrom the performance of his duties, such absence may be considered as\nunauthorized leave and shall not be charged against accumulated sick credits. Abuse of sick leave privileges shall be cause for disciplinary\naction. (5)\n\nThe department may\nrequire an employee who has been absent because of personal illness, prior to\nand as a condition of his return to duty, to be examined, at the expense of the\ndepartment, by a physician designated by the department, to establish that he\nis not disabled from the performance of his normal duties and that his return\nto duty will not jeopardize the health of other employees. (6)\n\nIn addition to personal illness of the\nemployee, the following types of absence, when approved by the department, may\nbe charged against accumulated sick leave credits: illness or death in the\nemployee's family; provided, however, that charge for such absence shall not\nexceed a maximum of 15 days in any one school year; personal visits to doctor\nor dentist. Proof of the need for such absences, satisfactory to the\ndepartment, may be required. (7)\n\nWhen an employee is transferred to another position in the same or a different\ndepartment or agency and such position is subject to attendance rules approved\nby the New York State Civil Service Commission, his accumulated sick leave\ncredits shall be transferred with him. When an employee is separated from\nservice for other than disciplinary reasons and is subsequently reinstated or\nreemployed within one year after such separation, or is reinstated by action of\nthe State Civil Service Commission, or is reinstated or reemployed while\neligible for reinstatement from a preferred list, his sick leave credits\naccumulated and unused at the time of his separation shall be restored; provided, however, that such sick leave credits shall not be restored except\nwhen leave records satisfactory to the appointing authority are\navailable. (8)\n\nEvery employee\nshall, on the date on which he becomes subject to these rules, be credited with\nthe number of days of sick leave which he had accumulated under the attendance\nrules for employees in New York State departments and institutions (see 4 NYCRR\nChapter II) and had remaining to his credit as of such date. (9)\n\nThis section shall not be construed to\nrequire extension of any employment beyond the time at which it would otherwise\nterminate by operation of law, rule or regulation. (e) Extended sick leave. (1)\n\nThe department may, in its discretion, advance sick leave credits to an employee absent due to personal illness who\nhas exhausted his accumulated sick leave credits. Such advance sick leave\ncredits shall be repaid, as soon as practicable after the employee's return to\nduty, from subsequent accumulations of time credits. The outstanding unrepaid\nsick leave credits advanced to any employee under the provisions of this\nsection shall not at any time exceed a total of five days. (2)\n\nUpon termination of the employee's\nservices any such advance of sick leave not offset by subsequent accumulations\nof sick leave credits, shall be deducted from salary or wages due the\nemployee. (f) Sick leave\nat half pay. The department may, in its discretion, grant sick leave at half\npay for personal illness to a permanent employee having not less than a year of\nservice after all of his sick leave credits have been used; provided, however, that the cumulative total of all sick leave at half pay granted to any employee\nafter January 2, 1957 shall not exceed one pay period for each complete six\nmonths of his State service. (g) Workers' compensation leave. (1)\n\nLeave for\nabsence necessitated by occupational injury or disease. Except as otherwise\nprovided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, an employee necessarily\nabsent from duty because of occupational injury or disease as defined in the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law, upon giving notice to the department that he is\nabsent on account of such injury or disease and that he claims benefits under\nsuch law, shall be allowed leave from his position for the period of absence\nnecessitated by such injury or disease, up to cumulatively one year including\nany periods of such absence during which the employee draws sick leave credits. Such leave may be extended for further periods in the discretion of the\nappointing authority. (2)\n\nControverted cases. If the employee's claim for benefits under the Workers'\nCompensation Law is controverted by the State Insurance Fund (at the request of\nthe department or on its own initiative) and the department is so notified, the\nemployee shall not be entitled to leave under this section. This shall not, however, adversely affect the employee's eligibility for leave under other\nprovisions of these rules. If final determination of the controverted claim is\nin favor of the employee, he shall be entitled to leave under this section, and\nall absences before such final determination, to the extent that the same were\nnecessitated by his occupational injury or disease, shall be deemed to have\nbeen pursuant to leave under this section. (3)\n\nPermanent incapacity. Leave under this\nsection may be withheld or terminated if the department determines that the\noccupational injury or disease suffered by the employee is of such a nature as\nto permanently incapacitate him for the performance of the duties of his\nposition. (4)\n\nPay during leave. An\nemployee on leave under this section may receive pay as follows: (i) The department upon finding that the\nemployee is in fact disabled from the performance of his duties, may grant the\nemployee full pay during such leave not exceeding cumulatively six months. Such\nfull pay may be granted irrespective of the employee's accrued credits under\nthese rules. (ii)\n\nExcept when on\nfull pay status under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the employee may draw\naccrued sick leave credits, subject to the provisions of these rules pertaining\nthereto. (iii)\n\nIf not drawing full\npay under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, an employee may, in the\ndiscretion of the department, be allowed to draw sick leave at half pay for\nwhich he may be eligible under these rules. (5)\n\nAccrual of leave credits. An employee who\nreceives full pay for any period of leave under this section shall earn sick\nleave credits during such period. (6)\n\nAward credited to State. An award by the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Board of compensation for any period for which the\nemployee receives or received pay from the State shall be credited to the State\nas reimbursement of wages paid. (7)\n\nRestoration of leave credits. Sick leave credits, including sick leave at half\npay, used by an employee during a period of absence for which an award of\ncompensation has been made and credited to the State as reimbursement for wages\npaid shall be restored to him in full; provided, however, that no restoration\nshall be made for any absence of less than a full day. Credits so restored may\nnot again be used for future absences attributable to the same injury. An\nemployee restored to service after absence on leave under this section shall\nhave one year from the date of such restoration to reduce his accrued leave\ncredits to the limits prescribed in these rules. (8)\n\nReinstatement. Upon request of the\nemployee for reinstatement at or prior to the expiration of the maximum period\nof allowed leave, the department, if in doubt as to whether the employee is\nphysically and mentally fit to perform the duties of his position, may require\nthe employee to undergo medical examination, by a physician designated by the\ndepartment, before the employee may be reinstated. If reinstatement is denied, the employee may make application therefor in the manner prescribed by section\n71\nof the Civil Service Law. If an employee\ncontinues absent after the expiration of the maximum period of allowed leave, his eligibility for reinstatement shall be governed by section 71 of this Civil\n\nService Law. (9)\n\nMedical\nexamination. In order to enable the department to make such determinations as\nare authorized or required under this section, the department may require an\nemployee at any time to be examined by a physician designated by the\ndepartment. (10)\n\nWhere the\ndepartment has refused to grant the employee pay during leave pursuant to\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision, or has withheld or terminated a leave of\nabsence on the ground that the occupational injury or disease is of such a\nnature as to permanently incapacitate the employee for the performance of the\nduties of his position, the employee may request the Civil Service Commission\nto review the determination of the department. If the commission finds that\nsuch determination of the department is arbitrary or unreasonable, it may\nreverse or modify such determination. (11)\n\nConstruction. This section shall not be\nconstrued to require extension of any employment beyond the time at which it\nwould otherwise terminate. (h) Leave for subpoenaed appearance and jury\nattendance. On proof of the necessity of jury service or appearance as a\nwitness pursuant to subpoena or other order of a court or body, an employee\nshall be granted a leave of absence with pay with no charge against leave\ncredits; provided, however, that this subdivision shall not apply to any\nabsence by an employee occasioned by such an appearance if he is a\nparty. (i) Leave for civil service\nexaminations. Employees shall be allowed leave with pay to take New York State\n\nCivil Service examinations at the appropriate center provided that due notice\nis given by the employee to the department. (j) Leave for quarantine. If an employee who\nis not ill himself is required to remain absent because of quarantine and\npresents a written statement of the attending physician or local health officer\nproving the necessity of such absence, he shall be granted leave with pay for\nthe period of his required absence, without charge against accumulated sick\nleave credits. Prior to return to duty, such employee may be required to submit\na written statement from the local health officer having jurisdiction that his\nreturn to duty will not jeopardize the health of other employees. (k) Leaves required by law. The department\nshall grant any leave of absence, with pay, required by law. (l) Leave for civil defense duties. Upon\ncertification by the State Director of Civil Defense of the necessity for the\nparticipation in State or local civil defense drills of an employee enrolled as\na civil defense volunteer and required to perform civil defense duties pursuant\nto the State Defense Emergency Act, the department may allow such employee to\nabsent himself from his position, without loss of pay or charge against leave\ncredits, for such time as is necessary for participation in such drills, but\nnot exceeding cumulatively five workdays per calendar year.
