(c) If a participant fails to demonstrate\nthat it has satisfied the eligibility requirements set forth in section\n211.2\nof this Title, the department\nshall not issue such participant a certificate of tax credit. (d) After reviewing such evidence and finding\nit sufficient, the department shall calculate the appropriate amount of tax\ncredit and issue a certificate of tax credit for one taxable year. The\ncertificate shall specify the exact amount of the job retention tax credit that\na participant may claim under this program, and shall specify the taxable year\nin which such credit may be claimed. The tax credit can only be claimed on tax\nreturns for the tax year indicated on the certificate.

In order to receive a certificate of tax credit for subsequent\ntaxable years, the participant must submit to the department a performance\nreport demonstrating that the participant continues to satisfy the eligibility\ncriteria specified in section\n211.2\nof this Title.
