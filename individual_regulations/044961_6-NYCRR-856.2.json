  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 856.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I of this Part an item number is assigned to\neach specifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I of this Part shall mean that number or abbreviation which\nhas been assigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for\nthe purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe\nnumbering or index system used to identify specific waters of New York State\nwas adapted from that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary\nwaters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred\nto by name or an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively\nnumbered progressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered\nconsecutively as they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the\nletter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as\nthey enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or\nmouth. When isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey of the Sparkill Creek watershed and has been closely followed\nin connection with the identification of the waters with the following\nexceptions: some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the\nomission of streams originally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation\n\nDepartment at the time of its survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced\nherein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on\nthe newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Sparkill Creek drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters Index\n\nNumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH-13 portion as described including P24\n\nSparkill Creek\n\nThe 13th tributary entering Hudson River in\n\nRockland Co. from Ferdon Mill Pond dam to Valentine Avenue, Sparkill. H-13-2 and trib. Trib. of Sparkill Creek\n\nThe 2nd trib. entering Sparkill Creek approx. 1.7\nmiles above mouth, east of Sparkill. H-13-2-1-P24a\n\nGolf Club Pond\n\nLocated at the Rockland Country Club, the source of\ntrib. 1 which flows into trib. 2. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water\nwhich flows into any other stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or other body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number; where tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface\nwater referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and\nsubtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless\nexceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I of this Part shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically\ndesignated waters are generally known and which may appear on the reference\nmaps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named\ntributary to which the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I of this Part shall mean a\nbrief indication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I of this Part means map reference number\nand indicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein\ncompletely, or in part, on which the specifically designated waters and their\nindex numbers are shown. The following map was produced from original maps\nwhich may be procured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological\n\nSurvey. Map Ref. No. Name of\n\nQuadrangle\n\nPublished by\n\nEdition\n2\n\nNyack (partial)\nU.S.G.S. 1943\n(g) Class\nas appearing in\ntable I of this Part, and denoted by the letters A, B, C, or D, opposite each\nspecifically designated waters, shall mean class A, B, C, or D, as the case may\nbe, as set forth in Part 701, supra. (h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I of this Part, and denoted by the letters A, B, C, or D, opposite\neach specifically designated waters shall mean the standards of quality and\npurity established for class A, B, C, or D, as the case may be, as set forth in\n\nPart 701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any standard\ndesignation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the\ndissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol\n(TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: Coregonus, Oncorhynchus, Prosopium, Salmo, Salvelinus\nand\n\nThymallus. (j) All\nstreams or other bodies of water which appear as lines to indicate natural\nwaters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated\nin table I of this Part, shall be assigned the same classes and standards of\nquality and purity as the specifically designated waters to which they are\ndirectly tributary. (k) All streams\nor other bodies of water which are not shown on the reference maps herein shall\nbe assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous flowing natural stream which is not shown on the\nreference maps shall have the same classification and assigned standards as the\nwaters to which it is directly tributary. (l) The Sparkill Creek drainage basin shall\nbe deemed to include the following areas: all land and water areas, the natural\nsurface water drainage from which is directly or indirectly tributary to\n\nSparkill Creek.
