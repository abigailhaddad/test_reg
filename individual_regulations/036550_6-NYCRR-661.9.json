  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 661.9 - Standards for issuance of permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Burden of proof. The applicant shall have the burden of establishing that the\napplicable standards of this section will be met. (b) Standards for permits on any tidal\nwetland. (1)\n\nOverall standards. The department\nshall issue a permit for a proposed regulated activity on any tidal wetland\nonly if it is determined that the proposed activity: (i) is compatible with the policy of the act\nto preserve and protect tidal wetlands and to prevent their despoliation and\ndestruction in that such regulated activity will not have an undue adverse\nimpact on the present or potential value of the affected tidal wetland area or\nadjoining or nearby tidal wetland areas for marine food production, wildlife\nhabitat, flood and hurricane and storm control, cleansing ecosystems, absorption of silt and organic material, recreation, education, research, or\nopen space and aesthetic appreciation, as more particularly set forth in the\nfindings in section\n661.2\nof this Part, taking into\naccount the social and economic benefits which may be derived from the proposed\nactivity; (ii)\nis compatible with\nthe public health and welfare; (iii)\nis reasonable and necessary, taking\ninto account such factors as reasonable alternatives to the proposed regulated\nactivity and the degree to which the activity requires water access or is water\ndependent; (iv)\ncomplies with the\ndevelopment restrictions contained in section\n661.6\nof this Part; and\n(v) complies with the use guidelines\ncontained in section\n661.5\nof this Part. If a proposed\nregulated activity is a presumptively incompatible use under such section, there shall be a presumption that the proposed regulated activity may not be\nundertaken in the subject area because it is not compatible with the area\ninvolved or with the preservation, protection or enhancement of the present or\npotential values of tidal wetlands if undertaken in that area. The applicant\nshall have the burden of overcoming such presumption and demonstrating that the\nproposed activity will be compatible with the area involved and with the\npreservation, protection and enhancement of the present and potential values of\ntidal wetlands. If a use is a type of use listed as an incompatible use in the\nuse guidelines for the area involved, it shall not be undertaken on that\narea. (2)\n\nFormerly\nconnected tidal wetland. In addition to the standards contained in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision, the department shall issue a permit for a regulated\nactivity on a formerly connected tidal wetland only if it is determined that\nthe proposed activity will be consistent with the possible future restoration\nof any portion of the tidal wetland adjoining or surrounding the project site\nto its original condition. (c) Standards for permits on adjacent areas. The department shall issue a permit for a proposed regulated activity on an\nadjacent area only if it is determined that the proposed regulated activity: (1)\nis compatible with the public health and\nwelfare; (2)\ncomplies with the\ndevelopment restrictions contained in section\n661.6\nof this Part; (3)\nwill not have an undue adverse impact on\nthe present or potential value of any adjacent or nearby tidal wetland for\nmarine food production, wildlife habitat, flood and hurricane and storm\ncontrol, cleansing ecosystems, absorption of silt and organic material, recreation, education, research or open space and aesthetic appreciation, taking into account the social and economic benefits which may be derived from\nthe proposed activity; and\n(4)\ncomplies with the use guidelines contained in section\n661.5\nof this Part. If a proposed\nactivity is a presumptively incompatible use for adjacent areas under such\nsection, there shall be a presumption that the proposed activity may not be\nundertaken on the adjacent area because it is not compatible with the\npreservation, protection, or enhancement of the present and potential values of\ntidal wetlands if undertaken in that area. The applicant shall have the burden\nof overcoming such presumption and demonstrating that the proposed regulated\nactivity will be compatible with the preservation, protection and enhancement\nof the present and potential values of tidal wetlands. If a use is a type of\nuse listed as an incompatible use, it shall not be undertaken on such adjacent\narea. (d) Notice of\nacquisition. Written notice by the department to an applicant proposing a\nregulated activity, or written notice to the department from the State or any\nagency or subdivision thereof, that the State or any such agency or subdivision\nis in the process of acquiring the tidal wetland or adjacent area on which the\nproposed regulated activity would be located by negotiation or condemnation\nshall be sufficient basis for denial of a permit for such regulated activity. Such notice may be provided at any time prior to the department's decision to\nissue or deny a permit for a regulated activity. (e) In determining whether the standards\ncontained in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section will be fulfilled by a\nproposed regulated activity, the department may in its discretion consider any\nproposal made by the applicant in his application to enhance the existing\nvalues served by a wetland on or in the vicinity of the site of the proposed\nregulated activity or to create and sustain new wetland values in or in the\nvicinity of the site of the proposed regulated activity, provided such proposal\nrelates to an area that is or will be regulated under this Part. (f) In any case in which an activity is\nspecified as a use not requiring a permit (NPN) under section\n661.5\nof this Part but requires a\npermit pursuant to title 5 of article 15 of the Environmental Conservation Law, the standards of this Part will be applied in the department's review of such\nactivity under article 15.
