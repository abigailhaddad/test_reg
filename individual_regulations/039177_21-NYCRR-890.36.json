  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 890.36 - Policy of protection and preservation\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe waters of the Delaware River Basin are limited in\nquantity and the Basin is frequently subject to drought warnings and drought\ndeclarations due to limited water supply storage and streamflow during dry\nperiods. Therefore, it shall be the policy of the commission to discourage the\nexportation of water form the Delaware River Basin. However, the basin waters\nhave limited assimilative capacity and limited capacity to accept conservative\nsubstances without significant impacts. Accordingly, it also shall be the\npolicy of the commission to discourage the importation of wastewater into the\n\nDelaware River Basin that would significantly reduce the assimilative capacity\nof the receiving stream on the basis that the ability of Delaware River Basin\nstreams to accept wastewater discharges should be reserved for users within the\nbasin. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n890.36\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
