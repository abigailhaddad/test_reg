OPWDD shall approve the request if OPWDD determines that there\nare extraordinary and/or unforeseeable circumstances beyond the provider's\ncontrol that will prevent the provider from filing the cost report by the due\ndate. OPWDD shall deny the request if OPWDD determines that there are not\nextraordinary and/or unforeseeable circumstances beyond the provider's control\nor that such circumstances should not prevent the provider from filing the cost\nreport by the due date. OPWDD shall notify the provider in writing of its\napproval or denial of the request. OPWDD's determination shall be\nfinal.
