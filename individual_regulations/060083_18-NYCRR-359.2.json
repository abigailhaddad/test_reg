Tit. 18 § 359.2 - Applicability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department\nand social services districts have the responsibility for investigating the\nalleged commission of intentional program violations and ensuring that the\nprocedures set forth in this Part are followed. (b) Subject to the provisions of section\n399.11\nof this Title, any matters\nor procedures commenced pursuant to Part 399 of this Title prior to the\neffective date of this Part will be continued in accordance with the provisions\nof this Part as if the matter had been commenced in accordance with this\n\nPart. (c) Administrative hearings\nfor public assistance IPVs and FS-IPVs may be scheduled by the office, provided\nthat not more than six years have elapsed between the month an individual\ncommitted an intentional program violation and the date on which the social\nservices district discovered the intentional program violation, and the office\ndetermines that there is evidence to substantiate that an intentional program\nviolation has occurred. (d) Unless\nspecifically granted written authorization to proceed directly on an FS-IPV by\neither a social services official or his or her authorized representative or\nthe appropriate district attorney, or by any other prosecutor authorized to act\non the matter, on the grounds that to do otherwise would prejudice the\nprosecution of an FS-IPV allegation, a social services district must initially\ntreat the allegation as an inadvertent household error in accordance with Part\n387 of this Title prior to either referring the case to the district attorney\nor processing the allegation for an administrative disqualification hearing. A\nsocial services district's failure to comply with the provisions of this\nsubdivision will not affect the department's determination at a hearing\nconducted pursuant to this Part or a court's determination when an allegation\nis referred by a social services district to the appropriate district attorney\nor any other prosecutor for prosecution. Noncompliance with the provisions of\nthis section will not affect the amount of any food stamp allotment reduction\nauthorized in section\n359.9\n(f) of this\n\nPart after a hearing decision is issued that an FS-IPV has occurred.
