  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 480.1 - Carrier and owner liable for tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 503, 508\n\nThe tax is imposed upon the carrier with respect to every\nmotor vehicle which he operates on the public highways of this State. This is\nso whether the carrier owns the vehicle or merely leases it or whether the\ncarrier is the person named in the permit. A carrier who operates a motor\nvehicle is liable for the tax although the permit therefor was obtained by\nanother. Thus, if a lessee operates a motor vehicle under a lease for a period\nof 30 days or less although the lessor may have obtained the permit and plate\ntherefor, the lessee is liable for the tax with respect to the operation of\nsuch motor vehicle. However, the statute also imposes liability for the tax\nupon the owner where the carrier and the owner of the motor vehicle are not the\nsame person. In such case the liability is a joint and several one on both the\ncarrier and the owner and the tax may therefore be collected from either\none. Example: A leases a motor vehicle from B on a six months' lease. A\nobtains a permit therefor and operates 1,000 miles upon New York roads. A and B\nare liable for the tax with respect to such mileage. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
