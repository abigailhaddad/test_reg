(b) The incidental and foreign material of\nthe cremation process shall be disposed of in a safe manner in compliance with\nall applicable Federal, State and local government sanitary rules and\nregulations. (c) (1)\n\nUnless the person in control of\ndisposition and the crematory otherwise agree as set forth in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, the entire cremains shall be pulverized until no single\nfragment is recognizable as skeletal tissue.

In that event, prior to pulverization of the cremains, the crematory\nmay set aside a single fragment which is recognizable as skeletal tissue and\nwhich does not have any dimension greater than three inches.

The single fragment that is set aside must be\ncombined again with the remainder of the cremains immediately after the\nremainder has been pulverized. The signed and witnessed writing from the person\nin control of disposition and the signed written consent of the crematory shall\nbe retained in the permanent file of the crematory. Notes\nN.Y.
