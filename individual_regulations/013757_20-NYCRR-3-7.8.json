  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-7.8 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following examples illustrate the application of the\nrules in Subpart 3-7. Example 1: Corporation X incorporated and began doing business in\n\nNew York (NY) on January 1, 2022. For tax year 2022, Corporation X has $5,000\nof interest expense directly and indirectly attributable to investment capital. Corporation X sustained a $9,000 Federal net capital gain, comprised of a\n$3,000 NY net business capital loss and a $12,000 NY net investment capital\ngain. Corporation X had no other investment income. The 2022 Federal 1120 contains the following\ninformation: Federal taxable income (FTI) before NOLD &\nspecial deduction\n$150,000\n\nState income taxes deducted\n$11,000\n2022 FTI income includes the following capital\ngains (Schedule D): 2022 NY net business capital loss\n($3,000)\n2022 NY net investment capital gain\n$12,000\n2022 Federal net capital gain\n$9,000\n\nAs NY net business capital loss offsets NY net investment\ncapital gains, FTI must be increased as follows: FTI before NOLD & special deduction\n$150,000\n\nIncrease FTI by the amount of the 2022 NY net\nbusiness capital loss that offsets NY net investment capital gains\n$3,000\nFTI adjusted for NY capital loss utilization\n(\"as if federal line 28)\n$153,000\n\nCalculation of business income base\nFTI adjusted for NY capital loss utilization\n(\"as if federal line 28)\n$153,000\n\nAdd: State income taxes deducted\n$11,000\n\nEntire net income (ENI)\n$164,000\n\nLess: Investment income ($12,000 investment\ncapital gain less $5,000 of attributable interest expenses)\n$7,000\n\nBusiness income\n$157,000\n\nCorporation X has a NY net business capital loss of\n$3,000 available for carryforward from 2022. Example 2: Corporation X incorporated and began doing business in NY\non January 1, 2011. For tax year 2014, it sustained a $75,000 NY net business\ncapital loss. Corporation X has NY business capital gains and losses and uses\nthe NY net business capital loss sustained in tax year 2014 as follows: Tax Year\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nNY net business capital gains or loss\n$3,000\n$6,000\n$9,000\n($75,000)\n$12,000\n$10,000\n$15,000\n$13,000\n$5,000\nNY net business capital loss carryback to\n2011\n($3,000)\n<------------\n<------------\n$3,000\nNY net business capital loss carryback to\n2012\n($6,000)\n<------------\n-$6,000\nNY net business capital loss carryback to\n2013\n($9,000)\n<------------\n$9,000\nNY net business capital loss carryforward to\n2015\n$12,000\n------------>\n($12,000)\nNY net business capital loss carryforward to\n2016\n$10,000\n------------>\n($10,000)\nNY net business capital loss carryforward to\n2017\n$15,000\n------------>\n------------>\n($15,000)\nNY net business capital loss carryforward to\n2018\n$13,000\n------------>\n------------>\n------------>\n($13,000)\nNY net business capital loss carryforward to\n2019\n$5,000\n------------>\n------------>\n------------>\n------------>\n($5,000)\nNY net business capital loss\n$0\n$0\n$0\n($2,000)\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n\nThe $2,000 remaining of the NY net business capital loss\nsustained in tax year 2014 is forfeited after tax year 2019 and cannot be\ncarried forward to any tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2020 as it\ncannot be carried forward more than five years succeeding the loss year. Example 3: For tax year 2014, Corporation X has a $9,000 Federal net\ncapital loss available for carryforward. While the $9,000 Federal net capital\nloss is comprised of a $2,000 business capital loss, a $6,000 investment\ncapital loss and a $1,000 subsidiary capital loss (not treated as a deduction\ndirectly attributable to subsidiary capital), the entire loss is treated as a\nNY net business capital loss in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. The Federal net capital loss is applied as follows in tax year\n2015: The 2015 Federal 1120 contains the following\ninformation: FTI before NOLD & special deduction\n$150,000\n\nState income taxes deducted\n$15,000\n2015 FTI includes the following capital\ngains/losses (Schedule D): 2015 NY business capital gains\n$4,000\n2015 NY investment capital gains\n$7,000\n\nLess: 2014 NY net business capital loss\nforward\n($9,000)\n\nTotal 2015 Federal capital gains after Federal\ncapital loss carryforward\n$2,000\n\nSince the FTI computation allows the $7,000 NY investment\ncapital gain to be partially offset by the $9,000 carryforward of NY net\nbusiness capital loss, FTI must be re-computed as follows: 2015 FTI before NOLD & special\ndeduction\n$150,000\n2014 Federal capital loss carried forward to\n2015\n$9,000\n2014 NY net business capital loss applied\nagainst NY business capital gains\n($4,000)\n\nIncrease FTI by the amount of the 2014 NY net\nbusiness capital loss applied against NY investment capital gains\n$5,000\nFTI adjusted for NY capital loss utilization\n(\"as if\" federal line 28)\n$155,000\n\nCalculation of business income base\nFTI adjusted for NY capital loss utilization\n(\"as if\" federal line 28)\n$155,000\n\nAdd: State income taxes deducted\n$15,000\nENI\n$170,000\n\nLess: Investment income (investment capital\ngain after interest attribution)\n($7,000)\n\nBusiness income\n$163,000\n\nThe 2014 NY net business capital loss carryforward is\ncomputed as follows: Total 2014 NY net business capital loss\n($9,000)\n\nLess: 2014 NY net business capital loss\nutilized against business capital gains in 2015\n$4,000\n\nTotal 2014 NY net business capital loss\navailable for carry forward against business capital gains\n($5,000)\n\nExample 4: Corporation X has NY net business capital gains in tax\nyears 2014, 2015, and 2017. In tax year 2016, it sustains a $30,000 NY net\nbusiness capital loss. While NY net business capital losses are generally\nallowed to be carried back three taxable years, such losses cannot be carried\nback to a tax year beginning before January 1, 2015. As a result, the net\nbusiness capital loss cannot be applied against the NY business capital gain\nsustained in tax year 2014. The NY net business capital loss is applied as\nfollows: Tax Year\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\nNY capital loss application\nNY business capital gain/loss\n$8,000\n$10,000\n($30,000)\n$20,000\nNY net business capital loss carryback from\n2016 to 2015\n($10,000)\n<-------$10,000\nNY net business capital loss carryforward from\n2016 to 2017\n$20,000\n------->($20,000)\nNY net business capital gain/loss\n$8,000\n$0\n$0\n$0\n\nExample 5: Corporation X sustains an $8,000 NY net investment\ncapital loss in tax year 2020. It has no NY investment capital gains in 2017\nthrough 2019 so the net investment capital loss cannot be carried back. It may\nonly be applied against NY investment capital gains as follows: Tax Year\n2020\n2021\n2022\n\nBusiness Capital Gain/(Loss)\n\nInvestment Capital Gain/(Loss)\n\nBusiness Capital Gain/(Loss)\n\nInvestment Capital Gain/(Loss)\n\nBusiness Capital Gain/(Loss)\n\nInvestment Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY net capital gain/loss\n$0\n($8,000)\n$10,000\n$3,000\n$9,000\n$7,000\nNY net investment capital loss carryforward\nfrom 2020 to 2021\n$3,000\n---------------->\n($3,000)\nNY net investment capital loss carryforward\nfrom 2020 to 2022\n$5,000\n---------------->\n---------------->\n---------------->\n($5,000)\nNY net capital gain/loss\n$0\n$0\n$10,000\n$9,000\n$2,000\n\nExample 6: For tax year 2020, Corporation X sustained a $10,000\n\nFederal net capital loss comprised entirely of a $10,000 NY net business\ncapital loss. For tax year 2021, Corporation X generated an $11,000 Federal net\ncapital gain comprised of a $6,000 NY net business capital gain and a $5,000 NY\nnet investment capital gain. For tax year 2022, Corporation X generated a\n$14,000 Federal net capital gain comprised entirely of a $14,000 NY net\nbusiness capital gain. It has no NY business capital gains in tax years before\n2020 so the NY business capital loss cannot be carried back. Therefore, the net\ncapital losses are applied against capital gains as follows: Tax Year\n2020\n2021\n2022\nNY Business Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY Investment Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY Business Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY Investment Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY Business Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY Investment Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY net capital gain/loss\n($10,000)\n$0\n$6,000\n$5,000\n$14,000\n$0\nNY net business capital loss carryforward from\n2020 to 2021\n$6,000\n----------------->\n($6,000)\nNY net business capital loss carryforward from\n2020 to 2022\n$4,000\n----------------->\n----------------->\n----------------->\n($4,000)\nNY net capital gain/loss\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$5,000\n$10,000\n$0\n\nExample 7: In tax year 2019, Corporation A used a $2,000 Federal net\ncapital loss. Such capital loss is classified as a NY net investment capital\nloss and offsets NY business capital gains. As a result, FTI reported on the\noriginal tax year 2019 return must be increased by the amount of the NY net\ninvestment capital loss as follows: The 2019 original Federal 1120 contains the following\ninformation: FTI before NOLD & special deduction\n$175,000\n\nState income taxes deducted\n$7,000\n2019 FTI income includes the following capital\ngains (Schedule D): 2019 NY business capital gains\n$6,000\n2019 NY investment capital loss\n($2,000)\n2019 Federal net capital gain\n$4,000\n\nRecomputation of FTI without NY net business capital gain\noffset by NY net investment capital loss on original 2019 return\nFTI before NOLD & special deduction\n$175,000\n\nIncrease FTI by the amount of the 2019 NY\ninvestment capital loss that offset NY business capital gain\n$2,000\nFTI adjusted for NY capital loss utilization\n(\"as if\" federal line 28)\n$177,000\n\nFor tax year 2022, Corporation A sustained a Federal net\ncapital loss of $8,000 comprised of a $3,000 NY net business capital loss and a\n$5,000 NY net investment capital loss. Corporation A carries the Federal net\ncapital loss back to the 2019 tax year and computes its 2019 FTI on the amended\n2019 return as follows: The 2019 amended Federal 1120 contains the following\ninformation: FTI before NOLD & special deduction\n$171,000\n\nState income taxes deducted\n$7,000\n\nAmended 2019 FTI income includes the following\ncapital gains (Schedule D): 2019 NY business capital gains\n$6,000\n2019 NY investment capital loss\n($2,000)\n2022 NY total capital loss carryback\n($4,000)\n2019 Federal net capital gain\n$0\n\nFor NY purposes, the tax year 2019 NY net investment\ncapital loss cannot offset the tax year 2019 NY business capital gain (as\nadjusted on the original tax year 2019 return). Additionally, Corporation A may\nonly carry back the tax year 2022 NY net business capital loss of $3,000 to tax\nyear 2019 as it has no NY investment capital gains in tax year 2019. Therefore, FTI must be re-computed on the amended tax year 2019 return as follows: Recomputation of FTI without regard to federal\napplication of capital losses\nFTI before NOLD & special deduction\n$171,000\n\nAdd: 2022 Federal capital loss carryback\napplied against capital gains on 2019 federal return\n$4,000\n\nAdd: 2019 NY investment capital loss\n$2,000\n\nSubtract: 2022 NY net business capital loss\ncarryback\n($3,000)\nFTI adjusted for NY capital loss utilization\n(\"as if\" federal line 28)\n$174,000\n\nThe re-computed FTI must be used in the computation of\ntax year 2019 business income as follows: Calculation of business income base\nFTI adjusted for NY capital loss utilization\n(\"as if\" federal line 28)\n$174,000\n\nAdd: State income taxes deducted\n$7,000\nENI\n$181,000\n\nLess: Investment income\n$0\n\nBusiness income\n$181,000\n\nCorporation A does not have NY net capital gains in tax\nyears 2020 or 2021 to apply against NY capital losses. As a result, at the end\nof tax year 2022, it has no NY net business capital loss carryforward and a\n$7,000 NY net investment capital loss carryforward as follows: Calculation of balance of NY net capital loss\nat the end of 2022\n\nTotal NY net capital gains/losses\nNY net business capital gains/losses\nNY net investment capital gains/losses\n\nNet capital loss sustained in 2022\n($8,000)\n($3,000)\n($5,000)\n\nAdd: 2019 NY net investment capital loss\n($2,000)\n($2,000)\n\nLess: 2022 NY net business capital loss carried\nback to 2019\n$3,000\n$3,000\n\nLess: 2022 capital loss utilized against\ncapital gains classified as business income in 2019\n$0\n\nBalance of NY net capital loss at the end of\n2022\n($7,000)\n$0\n($7,000)\n\nExample 8: Corporation X was incorporated and began doing business\nin NY on January 1, 2019. In calendar year 2019, it sustained a $35,500 Federal\nnet capital loss comprised of a $24,500 NY net business capital loss and an\n$11,000 NY net investment capital loss. These NY net capital losses cannot be\ncarried back as the corporation did not file NY State corporation tax returns\nprior to tax year 2019. Corporation X has NY filing years in 2019, 2020, and\n2022. Calendar year 2021 is a NY non-filing year. As a result, the 2019 NY net\ncapital loss cannot be used in tax year 2021 but this year counts toward the\nfive-year carryforward period. Such NY net capital losses are used as\nfollows: NYS Capital Loss Application\n\nSchedule\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nNY Business Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY Investment Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY Business\n\nCapital Gain/(Loss)\nNY Investment Capital Gain/(Loss)\n\nFederal Capital Gain/Loss\nNY Business Capital Gain/(Loss)\nNY Investment Capital Gain/(Loss)\n\nCapital Gains/Losses\n($24,500)\n($11,000)\n$12,500\n$0\n$15,000\n$1,000\n$3,000\nNY net business capital loss carryforward to\n2020\n$12,500\n---------------->\n($12,500)\nNY net business capital loss carryforward to\n2022\n$1,000\n----------------->\n----------------->\n----------------->\n---------------->\n($1,000)\nNY net investment capital loss carryforward to\n2022\n$3,000\n----------------->\n----------------->\n---------------->\n---------------->\n($3,000)\n\nCapital gain\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$15,000\n$0\n$0\n\nNet capital loss available after 2022\n($11,000)\n($8,000)\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n\nExample 9: Taxpayer A properly filed a combined report with members\nB, C and D in tax years 2020, 2021 and 2022. It has no NY net business or\ninvestment capital gains in years prior to 2020 so the NY net business capital\nlosses and NY net investment capital losses cannot be carried back.

Corporation D leaves the ABCD combined group\nat the end of tax year 2022. The combined group ABCD sustained a NY net\nbusiness capital loss and a NY net investment capital loss for tax year 2022. Each member of the group must compute its individual NY net capital loss\ncarryforward separately for each type of capital loss by multiplying the total\nNY net capital loss carryforward by a percentage that is the individual\nmember's contribution to that type of capital loss divided by the total capital\nloss for that type of capital. The individual members of the combined group\ncompute their individual NY net business capital loss carryforward and NY net\ninvestment capital loss carryforward as follows: Combined NYS Capital Loss\n\nApplication Schedule\n2022\n\nMember's losses as a % of total losses of all\nmembers with losses\n\nMember's Loss Carryforward\n\nCombined Group Members\n\nBusiness Capital Gains/(Losses)\n\nInvestment Capital Gains/(Losses)\n\nBusiness Capital Gains/(Losses)\n\nInvestment Capital Gains/(Losses)\n\nBusiness Capital Gains/(Losses)\n\nInvestment Capital Gains/(Losses)\nA\n$25,000\n$750\n0%\n0%\n$0\n$0\nB\n($25,000)\n($200)\n50%\n20%\n($12,500)\n($50)\nC\n($15,000)\n($500)\n30%\n50%\n($7,500)\n($125)\nD\n($10,000)\n($300)\n20%\n30%\n($5,000)\n($75)\n\nCombined Group ABCD\n($25,000)\n($250)\n100%\n100%\n($25,000)\n($250)\n\nCapital Loss Available\n($25,000)\n($250)\n($25,000)\n($250)\n\nTotal contribution of losses\n($50,000)\n($1,000)\n\nLeaving member D takes its NY net business capital loss\ncarryforward of $5,000 ($25,000 multiplied by 20%) and its NY net investment\ncapital loss carryforward of $75 ($250 multiplied by 30%).
