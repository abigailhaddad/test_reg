  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5.37 - Executive order no. 37: establishing joint task force on health care insurance fraud\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the provision of health care and the insurance\nreimbursement thereof directly and indirectly affect many sectors of the\npublic, business and government. The many facets of the business of insurance\n-- the organization and licensing of providers, the issuance of policies, the\npayment of claims and the provision of health care services to customers --\nconsist of numerous transactions which have the potential for abuse and illegal\nactivities. Each year, unscrupulous health care providers, illegitimate\nclaimants and other individuals cheat insurance companies out of billions of\ndollars; and\nWHEREAS, the General Accounting Office of the United States\n\nGovernment has estimated that approximately 10 percent of the more than 700\nbillion dollars in health care costs nationwide is attributable to health\ninsurance fraud and abuse, making this a national problem of epic proportions; and\nWHEREAS, the cost of health care coverage has risen sharply\nthroughout the nation as well as in New York in recent years due in part to the\nincrease in incidents of this abuse and these illegal activities otherwise\nknown as \"insurance fraud\"; and\nWHEREAS, the problem of insurance fraud in the health care\ninsurance industry is increasing in frequency and scope, resulting in a deluge\nof reports of health care insurance fraud to the Insurance Frauds Bureau of the\n\nNew York State Insurance Department. The Bureau received 789 health insurance\nrelated fraud reports in 1991, while in 1995 the Bureau received nearly ten\nthousand (10,000) health insurance-related fraud reports -- an increase of over\n1200% during a four-year period. The Bureau also in 1995 reported its highest\nnumber of arrests in this area in its fourteen year history; and\nWHEREAS, the problem of health care insurance fraud costs\nthe citizens of this state billions of dollars each year in higher premiums and\nendangers each citizen's access to quality affordable health care; and\nWHEREAS, the nature of the health care insurance industry\npresents a unique and difficult law enforcement problem. The existence of a\nvast number of health care providers enables unscrupulous individuals to\nquickly change the focus of their scams between the many different providers --\noften between public and private providers -- allowing them to keep one step\nahead of investigators. This insidious aspect of health care insurance fraud\nhighlights the need for a multi-agency coordinated approach by the government\nof New York State; and\nWHEREAS, the problem of health care insurance fraud is\npervasive, and, although state officials currently perform their duties in\ncombating this severe public problem in an outstanding manner, it is necessary\nnow to unite the expertise and experience of all agencies and departments which\ncurrently carry on the battle individually into a coordinated effort to attach\nthis critical public problem; NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: I. JOINT TASK FORCE ON HEALTH CARE INSURANCE\nFRAUD\nThere is hereby established the Joint Task Force on Health\n\nCare Insurance Fraud for the purpose of conducting coordinated investigations\ninto and prosecution of health care insurance fraud in New York State.
