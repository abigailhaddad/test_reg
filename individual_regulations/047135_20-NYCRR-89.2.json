  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 89.2 - Definition\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 470\n\nAny term defined in this Subchapter relating to the\ncigarette tax shall have the same meaning when used with respect to the tobacco\nproducts tax. For purposes of the tobacco products tax, the following terms\nshall have the meanings indicated below. (a) Tobacco products\nshall\nhave the same meaning as is found in section\n470 (2)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (b) Wholesale\nprice. (1)\n\nWholesale\nprice\nmeans the established price for which a manufacturer sells a\ntobacco product to a distributor, before the allowance of any discount, trade\nallowance, rebate or other reduction. In the absence of such an established\nprice, the manufacturer's invoice price for any tobacco product shall be\npresumptive evidence of the wholesale price of such tobacco product. In the\nabsence of both the manufacturer's established price and the manufacturer's\ninvoice price, the price at which the tobacco product was purchased shall be\npresumed to be the wholesale price. Whether the manufacturer' s established\nprice, the manufacturer's invoice price or the purchase price is utilized, the\nwholesale price shall be the invoice cost without allowance of any quantity\ndiscount, cash discount or any other reduction. If tobacco products are\ntransferred at no charge, gratis or are otherwise listed as free goods, it is\nin effect a discount and the ordinary or usual wholesale price of such products\nmust be added to the invoice to arrive at the total wholesale price subject to\ntax. Charges for freight, insurance, customs, duties and other similar charges\nnecessary to effectuate delivery, if separately stated on the invoice, are not\nincluded in the wholesale price. However, Federal excise taxes paid by the\nmanufacturer are included in the wholesale price. Such manufacturer' s invoice\nprice or such purchase price, as the case may be, shall be presumed to be the\nwholesale price, unless evidence of a lower wholesale price is established, or\nany industry standard of markups relating to the purchase price in relation to\nthe wholesale price is established. (2)\n\nThe Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay determine the wholesale price of any tobacco product based upon such\nevidence as may be presented by any person with an interest therein or such\ninformation as may be otherwise available. The department may require any\nappointed distributor of tobacco products and any applicant for appointment as\nsuch to submit a schedule containing the description, trade/brand name and\nwholesale price of every tobacco product imported or caused to be imported into\nthis State for sale, manufactured in this State or sold, shipped or delivered\nto any person within the State by such distributor or applicant. (c) Distributor\nmeans: (1)\nany person who imports or causes to\nbe imported into this State any tobacco product (in excess of 50 cigars or 1\npound of tobacco) for sale: (2)\nany\nperson who manufactures any tobacco product in this State; and\n(3)\nany person who is authorized by the\n\nCommissioner of Taxation and Finance to make returns and pay tax on tobacco\nproducts sold, shipped or delivered by such person to any other person in this\n\nState (hereinafter an authorized shipper). Application for appointment as a distributor of tobacco\nproducts must be made on a form prescribed by the department for such purpose\nand a distributor may be required to file a bond or deposit other acceptable\nsecurity as a condition of appointment. Where a distributor is also a wholesale\ndealer of tobacco products as defined in subdivision (d) of this section, such\ndistributor must procure a wholesale dealer's license. (d) Dealer, for\npurposes of Article 3 of this Subchapter, means any wholesale dealer or retail\ndealer of tobacco products. A wholesaler dealer of tobacco products is any\nperson who sells tobacco products in New York State to retail dealers or to any\nother persons for purposes of resale, and any person who owns, operates or\nmaintains tobacco product vending machines in, at or upon premises located in\nthis State that are owned or occupied by any other person. Every wholesale\ndealer of tobacco products must procure a wholesale dealer' s license and\nregister any individual tobacco product vending machines it may own/operate\nwith the department (see sections\n480\nand\n480-a\nof the Tax Law). A retail\ndealer of tobacco products is any person other than a wholesale dealer of\ntobacco products who sells such products in New York State. A retail dealer of\ntobacco products is required to register as a retail dealer and to register any\nindividual tobacco product vending machines it may own/operate in order to sell\ntobacco products at retail in this State (see section\n480-a\nof the Tax Law). If a wholesale\ndealer or retail dealer is also a distributor, such wholesale dealer or retail\ndealer is required to be appointed as a distributor. (See also, Part 73 of this\n\nTitle for retail dealer and vending machine registrations.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
