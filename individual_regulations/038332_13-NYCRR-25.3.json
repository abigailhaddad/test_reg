(vi)\n\nEscrow revisions. Before funds are transferred to any new escrow account, or if the escrow agent is replaced, the plan must be amended to provide the same full disclosure with respect to any new account, the escrow agent and the escrow agreement as was\noriginally provided. A bond, letter of credit or other security may be substituted for any escrow account only after the Office of the Attorney\n\nGeneral approves in writing the use of such alternate form of security, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subdivision. (vii)\n\nRelease of funds. The escrow agreement and the plan must set forth the requirements and procedures for the\nrelease of the escrowed funds. These shall include: (a) Under no circumstances shall sponsor seek release of the\nescrowed funds of a defaulting prospective resident until after occupancy in the Residence has commenced (consummation of the plan).

If the escrow agent receives a written notice from either party objecting to the release of the escrowed funds within\nsaid 30 day period, the escrow agent shall continue to hold said funds until otherwise directed pursuant to clause (\nb\n), of this\nsubparagraph. However, the escrow agent shall also have the right at any time to deposit the funds contained in the escrow account with the clerk of\na court in the county in which the interest offered pursuant to the plan is located and shall give written notice to both parties of such\ndeposit. (d) The sponsor shall not object to the release of the escrowed funds to: (1)\na prospective resident who timely rescinds in accordance with an offer of rescission contained in the plan or\nan amendment to the plan; or\n(2)\nall prospective residents after an amendment abandoning the plan is\naccepted for filing by the Office of the Attorney General. (viii)\n\nDisputes. (a) In the event of a dispute arising in connection with a residency agreement providing for dispute resolution by\nthe Attorney General that was signed on or before March 1, 2013, the sponsor shall apply and the prospective resident or the escrow agent holding the\ndeposits in escrow may apply to the Attorney General for a determination on the disposition of the deposit and any interest earned thereon. Forms for\nthis purpose will be available from the Office of the Attorney General. The party applying shall contemporaneously send to all other parties a copy\nof such application. (b) Pending the determination of the Attorney General to grant or deny the\napplication, the sponsor, the prospective resident and the escrow agent shall abide by any interim directive issued by the Attorney\n\nGeneral.

(d) The Attorney General shall act upon the application within 180 days after its submission to the Office of the\n\nAttorney General, by either making a determination or notifying the parties that an extension of time in which to do so is necessary for stated\nreasons. The Attorney General in its sole discretion, reserves the right to reject any application. (e) If the application seeking release of funds is denied, the escrow agent shall continue to hold the deposit and any interest earned thereon until: (1)\nboth the sponsor and prospective resident direct payment to a specified party in accordance with a written\ndirection signed by both the sponsor and prospective resident; or\n(2)\na final, non-reviewable order or\njudgment of a court is served on the escrow agent; or\n(3)\nthe escrow agent deposits the disputed amount\ninto court. (ix)\n\nExhibits to plan. Copies of the forms provided by the bank for\nopening any escrow account and the form of escrow agreement, if separate from the residency agreement, must be included as exhibit B-17 of the\nsubmission.

(xi)\n\nReview and audit. The Office of the Attorney General may perform\nrandom reviews and audits of any records involving escrow accounts to determine compliance with statute and regulation. (xii)\n\nWaiver void. Any provision of any contract or agreement, whether oral or in writing, by which a prospective\nresident purports to waive or indemnify any obligation of the escrow agent holding trust funds is absolutely void. The provisions of this section of\nthe regulations shall prevail over any conflicting or inconsistent provision in the offering plan or in an application form or residency\nagreement. (xiii)\n\nTrust obligation of sponsor. Nothing contained herein shall diminish or impair the\nsponsor's statutory obligation to each prospective resident pursuant to GBL section 352-h to hold in trust all deposits, advances or payments made in\nconnection with the offer until consummation of the transaction with such prospective resident. Consummation of the plan does not relieve sponsor of\nits obligations pursuant to GBL section 352-h.

Such funds shall not be a part\nof the estate of the sponsor or the escrow agent upon any bankruptcy, incapacity or death. (xiv)\n\nTransition.

(iii)\n\nChange from escrow account. When surety bonds are or a letter of credit is to be provided\nunder an amendment to the plan calling for release of funds already deposited in escrow, the amendment shall provide for, and annex a form for, the\nwritten consent of each prospective resident and shall provided for continuation of escrow of funds of any prospective resident who does not execute\nand deliver such written consent to the sponsor.
