  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.935 - Preventive and mitigative measures to protect the high consequence areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\nrequirements. An operator must take additional measures beyond those already\nrequired by this Part to prevent a pipeline failure and to mitigate the\nconsequences of a pipeline failure in a high consequence area. An operator must\nbase the additional measures on the threats the operator has identified to each\npipeline segment. (See section\n255.917\nof this Part.) An operator\nmust conduct, in accordance with one of the risk assessment approaches in\nASME/ANSI B31.8S (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), section 5, a\nrisk analysis of its pipeline to identify additional measures to protect the\nhigh consequence area and enhance public safety. Such additional measures\ninclude, but are not limited to, installing automatic shut-off valves or remote\ncontrol valves, installing computerized monitoring and leak detection systems, replacing pipe segments with pipe of heavier wall thickness, providing\nadditional training to personnel on response procedures, conducting drills with\nlocal emergency responders and implementing additional inspection and\nmaintenance programs. (b) Third\nparty damage and outside force damage. (1)\n\nThird party damage. An operator must enhance its damage prevention program, as\nrequired under section\n255.614\nof this Part, with respect\nto a covered segment to prevent and minimize the consequences of a release due\nto third party damage. Enhanced measures to an existing damage prevention\nprogram include, at a minimum: (i) using\nqualified personnel (see section\n255.915\nof this Part) for work an\noperator is conducting that could adversely affect the integrity of a covered\nsegment, such as marking, locating, and direct supervision of known excavation\nwork; (ii)\ncollecting in a central\ndatabase information that is location specific on excavation damage that occurs\nin covered and non covered segments in the transmission system and the root\ncause analysis to support identification of targeted additional preventative\nand mitigative measures in the high consequence areas. This information must\ninclude recognized damage that is not required to be reported as an incident\nunder sections\n255.801\n(a) and\n255.831\nof this Part; (iii)\nparticipating in one-call systems in\nlocations where covered segments are present; (iv)\nmonitoring of excavations conducted on\ncovered pipeline segments by pipeline personnel. If an operator finds physical\nevidence of encroachment involving excavation that the operator did not monitor\nnear a covered segment, an operator must either excavate the area near the\nencroachment or conduct an above ground survey using methods defined in NACE RP\n0502 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). An operator\nmust excavate, and remediate, in accordance with ANSI/ASME B31.8S and section\n255.933\nof this Part any\nindication of coating holidays or discontinuity warranting direct\nexamination. (2)\n\nOutside\nforce damage. If an operator determines that outside force (e.g., earth\nmovement, floods, unstable suspension bridge) is a threat to the integrity of a\ncovered segment, the operator must take measures to minimize the consequences\nto the covered segment from outside force damage. These measures include, but\nare not limited to, increasing the frequency of aerial, foot or other methods\nof patrols, adding external protection, reducing external stress, and\nrelocating the line. (c) Automatic shut-off valves (ASV) or remote control valves (RCV). If an operator\ndetermines, based on a risk analysis, that an ASV or RCV would be an efficient\nmeans of adding protection to a high consequence area in the event of a gas\nrelease, an operator must install the ASV or RCV. In making that determination, an operator must, at least, consider the following factors -- swiftness of leak\ndetection and pipe shutdown capabilities, the type of gas being transported, operating pressure, the rate of potential release, pipeline profile, the\npotential for ignition, and location of nearest response personnel. (d) Pipelines operating below 30 percent\nSMYS. An operator of a transmission pipeline operating below 30 percent SMYS\nlocated in a high consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs\n(1) and (2) of this subdivision. An operator of a transmission pipeline\noperating below 30 percent SMYS located in a class 3 or class 4 area but not in\na high consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs (1), (2) and\n(3) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nApply the\nrequirements in subparagraphs (b)(1)(i) and (iii) of this section to the\npipeline. (2)\n\nEither monitor\nexcavations near the pipeline, or conduct patrols as required by section\n255.705\nof this Part of the\npipeline at bi-monthly intervals. If an operator finds any indication of\nunreported construction activity, the operator must conduct a follow up\ninvestigation to determine if mechanical damage has occurred. (3)\n\nPerform semiannual leak surveys\n(quarterly for unprotected pipelines or cathodically protected pipe where\nelectrical surveys are impractical). (e) Plastic transmission pipeline. An\noperator of a plastic transmission pipeline must apply the requirements in\nsubparagraphs (b)(1)(i), (iii) and (iv) of this section to the covered segments\nof the pipeline. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.935\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
