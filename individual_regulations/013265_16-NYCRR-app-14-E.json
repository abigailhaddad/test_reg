Guidance on Determining a High Consequence Area\n\nTo determine which segments of an operator's transmission\npipeline system are covered for purposes of the integrity management program\nrequirements, an operator must identify the high consequence areas. An operator\nmust use the methods defined in paragraphs (1) or (2) of subdivision (f) of\nsection\n255.903\nof this Part to identify a\nhigh consequence area. An operator may apply one method to its entire pipeline\nsystem, or an operator may apply one method to individual portions of the\npipeline system. (Refer to Figure 1 below for a diagram of a high consequence\narea.)\nFIGURE 1\nII. Guidance on Assessment Methods and Additional Preventive\nand Mitigative Measures for Transmission Pipelines\n(a) Table 1 below gives guidance to help an operator implement\nrequirements on additional preventive and mitigative measures for addressing\ntime dependent and independent threats for a transmission pipeline operating\nbelow 30 percent SMYS not in a High Consequence Area (\ni.e., outside of potential impact circle) but located within a Class 3 or Class 4\n\nLocation. (b) Table 2 below gives guidance to help an operator implement\nrequirements on assessment methods for addressing time dependent and\nindependent threats for a transmission pipeline in a high consequence\narea. (c) Table 3 below gives guidance on preventive and mitigative\nmeasures addressing time dependent and independent threats for transmission\npipelines that operate below 30 percent SMYS, in high consequence areas.
