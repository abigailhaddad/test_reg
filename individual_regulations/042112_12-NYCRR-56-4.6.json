  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-4.6 - Test methods\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe same NIOSH approved methodology for project air\nsampling and for analysis of the air samples shall be used at all phases of an\nasbestos project that require area air sampling and analysis, with the possible\nexception of clearance air sampling. Phase contrast microscopy (PCM) shall be\nthe minimum acceptable method of analysis. In lieu of PCM clearance air\nsampling and analysis, the building/structure owner may elect to utilize TEM\nair sampling and analysis to meet clearance air sampling requirements. If\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the selected method of analysis, the\nclearance criteria and sampling protocols of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency\n\nResponse Act (AHERA) shall be used. If PCM air sample analysis results exceed\nthe satisfactory clearance air criteria under this Part, then TEM analysis of\nthe entire set of clearance air samples may be used, provided that a standard\nNIOSH/ELAP accepted laboratory analysis method is used that shall report each\nair sample result in fibers per cubic centimeter, for appropriate correlation\nto the original unsatisfactory PCM clearance air sample results and the\nestablished background levels, and provided that a report is submitted to the\ncommissioner for the entire set of clearance air sample PCM and TEM laboratory\nanalyses. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-4.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
