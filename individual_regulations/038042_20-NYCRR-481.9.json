  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 481.9 - Unloaded weight method\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 503(3)\n(a) Under the unloaded weight method the tax\non a truck or tractor is computed by determining the rate of tax from the table\nset forth in section\n481.10, infra, based on the unloaded weight of the truck or tractor\nand by multiplying the total mileage operated within the State by such\nrate. (b) The applicable rate of\ntax for a truck is determined by the unloaded weight as set forth in the\npermit. The same rate is applicable whether the truck is operated with or\nwithout a load. Example: If the unloaded weight of a truck if 8,500 pounds, the\napplicable tax rate if $.004, whether it carries a load of 5,000 or 10,000\npounds. If it travels 100 miles the tax is computed as follows: 100 × $.004 = $.40\n(c) The applicable rate of tax for a tractor\nis determined by its unloaded weight as set forth in its permit, whether it is\noperated alone or in combination with another motor vehicle. Example: A tractor with an unloaded weight of 6,000 pounds travels\n50 miles, a trailer with a maximum gross weight of 25,000 pounds is then\nattached and the tractor-trailer combination travels 50 miles. The applicable\ntax rate for the entire trip is $.010. The tax is computed as follows: 100 × $.010 = $1.00\n(d) Although the tax is based on unloaded\nweight as set forth in the permit, nevertheless if the actual unloaded weight\nis in excess of that set forth in the permit, the tax must be computed at the\nrate applicable to the actual weight. In such case, an amended permit must be\nobtained. (See §\n473.6, supra. )\n(e) Where\nan amended permit is issued on the basis of a decrease in unloaded weight, the\nunloaded weight set forth in the amended permit is not effective for tax\npurposes until the superseded permit is surrendered to the State Tax\n\nCommission. (See §\n473.5, supra. )\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n481.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
