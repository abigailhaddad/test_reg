Tit. 9 § 5317.36 - Verification of system software\n\nState Regulations\n\nSystem software components and modules shall be\nverifiable by a secure means at the system level, denoting program\nidentification and version. The system shall have the ability to allow for an\nindependent integrity check of the components and modules from an outside\nsource. Such ability is required for all control programs that may affect the\nintegrity of the system. Such ability shall be capable of being authenticated\nby a third-party device, which may be embedded within the system software or\nhaving an interface port for a third-party device to authenticate the media. Such integrity check shall provide a means for field verification of the system\ncomponents and modules to identify and validate the programs and files. The\nlicensed independent testing laboratory, prior to system approval, shall\napprove the integrity check method. If the authentication program is contained\nwithin the system software, the manufacturer shall receive written approval\nfrom the licensed independent testing laboratory prior to\nsubmission.
