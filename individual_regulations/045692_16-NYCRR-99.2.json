  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 99.2 - Procedures and requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nutility shall allocate annually to a VSR undergrounding fund an amount equal to\nthe greater of: (1)\nthe average of its annual\nexpenditures on the underground installation of new underground distribution\nlines, service lines or appurtenant facilities within residential subdivisions\nfor the years 1985, 1986 and 1987; or\n(2)\n0.14 percent of its 1987 sales to\nultimate customers. The amount to be allocated to the fund shall be adjusted\nfor inflation each year according to the Handy-Whitman Index. The amount in the\nfund is the company's maximum obligation in a given year. Each utility shall\ninstall or provide for the installation of new underground distribution lines, service lines or appurtenant facilities under this Part unless it has expended\nits maximum obligation in a given year. Each utility shall spend up to such\nmaximum obligation on the cost of installing such facilities underground that\nexceeds what an applicant for a line extension would have paid for facilities\nhad the area not been designated as a VSR. Note:For example, for a 120-foot line of single phase\nservice to a residential applicant in a VSR, with an overhead construction cost\nper foot of $5 and underground construction cost per foot of $20, the total\ncost of overhead construction would be $600 and undergrounding $2400. Overhead\nconstruction with a 500-foot allowance would cost the utility $600 ($5.00 per\nfoot times 120 feet) and the applicant would pay nothing. If the utility had\nnot spent its maximum obligation and undergrounding is appropriate, the utility\nwould pay a total of $2,400 from the VSR maximum obligation fund. The applicant\nwould pay nothing. Note:For a 700-foot line, under the same circumstances\nassuming the same costs, the total cost of overhead construction with a\n500-foot allowance would cost the utility $2500 ($5.00 per foot times 500 feet)\nand the applicant would pay $1,000 ($5.00 per foot times 200 feet). If the\nutility had not spent its maximum obligation, and undergrounding was\nappropriate, the utility would pay a total of $13,000 from the maximum\nobligation fund. The applicant would pay $1,000. If a utility spends in excess of its maximum obligation in\na particular year, the excess shall reduce its maximum obligation of the\nfollowing year by the amount of such excess. After a utility spends its maximum\nobligation in a particular year, additional VSR undergrounding is not required\nin that year. If a utility does not spend its maximum obligation in a given\nyear, any unspent portion shall be carried over to the next year. (b) In addition to\nother procedures which may apply in connection with the proposed construction\nof a particular distribution line, service line or appurtenant facilities: (1)\nif a utility has not expended its maximum\nobligation as described in subdivision (a) of this section in a particular year\nwhen it chooses to propose or receives a written application for service to a\npremises which necessitates the new construction of a distribution line, service line or appurtenant facilities on public or private land in a VSR, the\nutility shall provide a written report to the agency which designated or\nadministers the VSR, any agency having jurisdiction over affected public land\nand the commission, of its intention to install, or provide for the\ninstallation of, the necessary facilities underground or overhead (including a\nproject description and consideration of the factors set forth in subdivision\n[j] of this section), at least 60 days before construction is planned to\ncommence; (2)\nnotwithstanding the\nprovisions of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a utility may provide the\nwritten report described therein within 30 days after the commencement of\nconstruction if the necessary distribution line, service line or appurtenant\nfacilities are installed overhead on a temporary basis, pending the review of\nthe utility's report if the visual impact of the temporary service is\nmitigated, to the extent appropriate, after the procedures of this section are\nfollowed; (3)\nnotwithstanding the\nprovisions of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a utility may install\npermanent overhead facilities if the utility, before installation: (i) determines that the situation is an\nemergency; (ii)\nobtains the written\napproval of the appropriate agency(ies); and\n(iii)\nupon written request, obtains the\nwritten approval of the secretary of the commission; and\n(4)\nif undergrounding is otherwise required\nin a VSR, and if the per-foot cost of installing the necessary facilities will\nbe greater than two times the charge per foot filed pursuant to section\n98.6\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Title and as set forth in the utility's tariff, the utility or the\napplicant may petition the secretary of the commission to allow overhead\ninstallation. Approvals shall be granted or denied based on economic, engineering, environmental, emergency or hardship considerations. (c) Unless the agency(ies)\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of this section provide(s) written notification\nin-hand to both the utility and the commission objecting to the utility's\nproposal within 30 days after receipt of the utility's report, the utility may\ninstall or provide for the installation of the facilities in question as\ncontemplated in its report. The utility may also proceed as contemplated in its\nreport within such 30-day period if the agency(ies) provide(s) written\nnotification to both the utility and the commission concurring with the\nutility's proposal. (d) If the\nagency(ies) described in subdivision (b) of this section provide(s) written\nnotification in-hand to both the utility and the commission objecting to the\nutility's proposal (including a detailed explanation of such objection) within\n30 days after receipt of the utility's report, the commission shall review the\nreport and notification(s) filed by the utility and the agency(ies). (e) Unless the commission serves on the\nutility an order requiring the installation of the facilities in question to be\nperformed in a different manner than that contemplated by the utility within 30\ndays after the commission's receipt of the agencies' notification pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of this section, the utility may install or provide for the\ninstallation of such facilities as contemplated in its report. The utility may\nalso proceed as contemplated in its report within such 30-day period if the\ncommission serves on it an order concurring with the utility's\nproposal. (f) If an agency referred\nto in subdivision (h) of this section intends to supply a map or maps of a\nVSR(s) listed in such subdivision to the affected utility(ies) and the\ncommission, such agency shall consult with such utility(ies) and the\ncommission's staff as to the appropriate scale(s) and other details of such\nmap(s). (g) If an agency referred\nto in subdivision (h) of this section has a VSR map prepared before the\neffective date of these regulations, such map may be filed with the commission\nand utilities without consultation if the map otherwise complies with section\n99.1\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Part. (h) A VSR is: (1)\none of the following resources which is\ndesignated as having high scenic quality: (i) scenic areas of statewide significance (in coastal areas), designated by the\n\nSecretary of State pursuant to article 42 of the Executive Law; (ii)\n\nAdirondack Park scenic vistas, designated by the Adirondack Park Agency, identified on the private land use\nand development plan map and listed in the State Land Master Plan for the\n\nAdirondack Park pursuant to article 27 of the Executive Law; (iii)\nscenic roads, designated by the\n\nCommissioner of Environmental Conservation pursuant to article 49 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law; (iv)\nscenic districts, designated by the\n\nCommissioner of Environmental Conservation pursuant to article 49 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law; (v) State and national wild and scenic river areas administered respectively by\neither the Department of Environmental Conservation or the Adirondack Park\n\nAgency pursuant to article 15 of the Environmental Conservation Law, and by the\n\nDepartment of Interior, pursuant to\n16 U.S.C. §\n1271; and\n(vi)\nareas of exceptional scenic beauty, acquired pursuant to the 1986 Environmental Quality Bond Act and administered\nby the Department of Environmental Conservation. (2)\nany area in one of the following\nresources which is determined to have high scenic quality by the agency with\njurisdiction over the affected resource, as long as such determination is filed\nwith the commission: (i) State nature and\nhistoric preserve areas designated by the Legislature. (ii)\n\nState parks, which were so designated\nfor their scenic quality by the Legislature, the Department of Environmental\n\nConservation or the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, including the Adirondack and Catskill Parks. (iii)\n\nLake George Park, except incorporated\nvillages, administered by the Lake George Park Commission, pursuant to article\n43 of the Environmental Conservation Law. (iv)\n\nParks within New York State administered\nby the Palisades Interstate Park Commission pursuant to article 9 of the Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law. (v) State historic sites owned by the Office\nof Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation under article 19 of the Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law and Title 9 NYCRR Part\n384. (vi)\n\nNational historic sites, national\nseashores and national recreation areas located in New York State and operated\nby the National Park Service. (i) The listing of VSRs in subdivision (h) of\nthis section constitutes a determination that the new construction of\ndistribution lines, service lines and appurtenant facilities underground is\ngenerally more appropriate therein than elsewhere. Neither such listing nor any\nagency's provision of a map of a given VSR to the affected utility and the\ncommission, however, shall create a presumption that construction of particular\nfacilities underground is appropriate. The propriety of such construction\nshall, instead, be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in\nsubdivisions (b)-(e) of this section. (j) In evaluating the utility's proposal\npursuant to subdivision (e) of this section, the commission will consider such\nfactors as: (1)\nthe nature of the visual\nsetting in the vicinity of the proposed construction, including the character\nof existing or proposed adjacent structures or land areas, unless a\ngovernmental authority with jurisdiction has plans to improve the scenic\nquality of the area in question; (2)\nthe probable environmental effects\nassociated with both overhead and underground construction; (3)\nany expected engineering difficulties\nassociated with both overhead and underground construction; and\n(4)\nthe estimated costs associated with both\noverhead and underground construction. (k) In the event a utility either intends at\nits own discretion or is required pursuant to this Part to place a distribution\nline, service line or appurtenant facilities underground, it shall inform the\ntelephone company and cable television company serving the area in which the\nunderground construction is to be located. If a new common access route from\nexisting facilities to the location of such underground construction will be\nused, the portions of the connecting facilities of the utility, the telephone\ncompany and cable television company that are located in a VSR shall be placed\nunderground. (l) A utility shall\ninstall any necessary distribution line, service line or appurtenant\nfacilities, with sufficient capacity and using suitable material which, in its\njudgment, will assure that an applicant receives safe and adequate service. Such installation shall be undertaken as soon as is reasonably possible after\ncompliance with the procedures contained in this Part and shall be made at a\ntime appropriate to render service. Construction shall not be delayed by the\nutility except where such delay is caused by strikes, fire, flood, inclement\nweather, unavailability of materials, civil disorders or other conditions\nbeyond the control of the utility. (m) Any interested agency or person may\npetition the commission to add additional categories to the VSR list of\nsubdivision (h) of this section. The commission will approve or disapprove the\naddition of a proposed category based on whether the category fits within the\nVSR definition in section\n98.1\n(l)(1)\nof\nthis Title. (n) The VSR program\nshall be evaluated by the commission after the program has been in effect for\ntwo years. Utilities shall submit to the department within six months after the\nprogram has been in effect for two years, details of their experience with the\nprogram including: all locations of line extension construction in VSRs, the\ntotal length of all facilities undergrounded in VSRs, costs incurred by the\nutility, costs incurred by applicants for their share of line extension costs, problems encountered with the program, suggestions for changes in the program\nor any other information the utility deems relevant to evaluation of the VSR\nprogram. The Department of Public Service staff and/or the commission may\nrequest, and the utilities shall provide, any information the commission or\nstaff deem relevant to evaluation of the VSR program.
