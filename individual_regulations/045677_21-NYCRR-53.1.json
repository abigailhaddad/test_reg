  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 53.1 - Stationing of pilot vessels at the entrance to New York Harbor\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purpose of receiving pilots from outward bound\nvessels and supplying pilots to inward bound vessels, the Sandy Hook pilots\nshall station such pilot vessels at the entrance to New York Harbor, in the\nvicinity of Ambrose Light Tower as may be required to provide adequate service. A pilot vessel or vessels will remain on station at all times except when, in\nthe judgment of the executive committees of the Sandy Hook pilot associations\nduring periods of extreme weather and after it is determined that there will be\nno arrivals or departures, it is deemed prudent to shift to more sheltered\nwaters. It shall be the duty of the crew of any pilot vessel on station to\nrender every necessary aid to pilots boarding and leaving\nvessels. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n53.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
