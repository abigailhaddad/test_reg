  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 552.1 - Application and fee\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It shall be unlawful for any owner or operator to commence operations to drill, deepen, plug back or convert a well for exploration, production, input, storage\nor disposal until he has filed an application with the department and has\nreceived a permit as specified below. This application shall not be required\nfor deepening or plug back operations to be conducted exclusively within the\nproducing horizon of a pool. (b) Each copy of the application must be accompanied by a neat, legible plat which\nhas been certified as to correctness by a licensed land surveyor or licensed\ncivil engineer. The plat must be drawn to scale and show the boundaries of the\nlease or unit containing the well, the distance in feet from the well to the\ntwo nearest boundaries, the distance in feet from the well to the nearest well\ncompleted in the objective pool (if same is within one mile) and the distance\nin feet from the well to the nearest producing well (if same is within one\nmile). Both of the latter two distances may be obtained by scaling from a map, stadia measurements, pacing, odometer or other reasonably accurate means. However, if the distance between the well and the nearest well completed in the\nobjective pool is such that there is a possibility of violation of the spacing\nrequirements of sections\n553.1\nor\n553.3, the distance between the\nwell and the nearest well completed in the objective pool shall be measured\naccurately on the ground. The plat also must have indicated thereon the\nlatitude and longitude of the well and the scaled distances in feet in\neast-west and north-south directions from the nearest corner of the United\n\nStates Geological Survey topographical map upon which the well location is\nsituated, with the topographical map being identified by title, date and as to\nwhether seven and one-half minute or 15 minute coverage. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n552.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
