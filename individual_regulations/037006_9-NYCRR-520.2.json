  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 520.2 - Types of punishment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nAdmonition. This is a warning, reminder or reproof given by a commander\nto an offender to deter repetition of the type of misconduct which resulted in\nthe admonition and to advise him of the consequences that may flow from a\nrecurrence of that misconduct. An admonition may be oral or written and may be\nincluded in a reprimand. (2)\n\nReprimand. A\nreprimand\nis the act of formal censure\nby a commander which reproves or rebukes the offender for his misconduct. It\nmay be oral or written. (i) Reprimand\nor admonition may be given administratively as a nonpunitive measure to improve\nefficiency. For this purpose, the procedures contained in this regulation need\nnot be followed. If, however, the commander elects to impose either a reprimand\nor an admonition as non-judicial punishment under Military Law, section\n130.15, the punishment must be imposed in accordance with the procedures outlined in\nthis regulation. (3)\n\nWithholding of privileges. This shall only be executed while the offender is in a duty\nstatus. (4)\n\nRestriction to\ncertain specified limits. This shall only be executed while the offender is in a duty\nstatus, with or without suspension from performance of duty. (5)\n\nExtra duties: (i) Shall only be executed while the offender\nis in a duty status. (ii)\n\nThe\nperformance of extra duties shall not exceed two hours per day, and may include\nholidays. (iii)\n\nExtra duties may\ninclude performance of any military duty except duty which: (a) demeans the grade or position of the\noffender in type of duty or manner of performance; (b) constitutes punishment not sanctioned by\nthe customs of the military; (c) normally is intended as an honor; or\n(d) uses the offender as a personal\nservant. (iv)\n\nAn inactive\nduty period may be extended beyond the normal four hour period to accommodate\nthe performance of the extra duties. (See ML, 130.15[a][2][C].)\n(6)\n\nConfinement. Confinement is limited to those instances authorized in\n\nMilitary Law, section\n130.15\n(a)(2)(E), and shall only be executed while the\noffender is in a duty status. (7)\n\nThe punishments of withholding of\nprivileges, restrictions to certain specified limits, extra duties and\nconfinement, shall be executed within 60 days after the punishment is\nimposed. (8)\n\nFines. These may apply to pay or allowances as stated in Military\n\nLaw, section\n130.15, subdivisions (a)(1)(C) and (a)(2)(F). (i) Reduction in grade (herein meaning \"pay\ngrade\"). (a) Only the commander with the\nauthority to promote to the grade from which demoted may reduce a member in\ngrade. See section\n520.7\nof this Part for reduction of offenders in grades E-7, E-8 and E-9. (b) An offender may be reduced only one grade\nin each non-judicial punishment action. (b) Limitations on types of punishment. (1)\n\nIn addition to, or in lieu of an admonition or reprimand, only one of the\nauthorized punishments in Military Law, section\n130.15\nmay be imposed for each\nnon-judicial punishment action. (2)\n\nThe punishments of confinement, extra duties, or reduction may not be imposed\nnon-judicially on officers or warrant officers. (3)\n\nPunishments imposed may not be so grossly\ndisproportionate to the offenses committed, so as to violate fundamental\nprinciples of fairness and justice. (c) Suspension, mitigation, remission\nand setting aside of punishment. The commander who imposed non-judicial punishment, his\nsuccessor-in-command, and superior authority have the power to thereafter\nsuspend, vacate or extend a suspension, mitigate, remit or set aside all or any\npart or amount of the punishment and to restore all rights, privileges and\nproperty affected. (1)\n\nSuspension of\npunishment. This is to postpone application of all, or a portion of a\npunishment for a specified probationary period, with the understanding that the\npunishment will be automatically remitted at the end of that period if the\noffender has not been guilty of further misconduct. (i) Any authorized punishment may be\nsuspended. (ii)\n\nThe purpose of\nsuspending punishment is to grant a deserving individual a probationary period\nduring which he may demonstrate that he is worthy of a \"second chance\" in that\nthe offense for which non-judicial punishment was imposed was a temporary lapse\nin an otherwise good service record. (iii)\n\nThe commander suspending the punishment\nmust indicate in the correspondence suspending the punishment that the\npunishment will automatically terminate at the end of a specified period, or on\na specified date, if the offender has not been guilty of any subsequent offense\npunishable under the Military Law committed during the period of\nsuspension. (iv)\n\nPunishment may not\nbe suspended for a period longer than the earlier of six calendar months from\nthe date of suspension, or beyond an enlistment or current term of service. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this\nregulation to the contrary, the period of suspension may be extended by the\ncommander who suspended the punishment by as many days as an offender is AWOL\nfrom duty during the suspension period, but in no event beyond an enlistment or\ncurrent term of service. A\nday\nas used herein is any part of a\nday in which the offender was required to be in a duty status. (b) This commander with mail or deliver to\nthe offender written notice that his suspension period has been extended to a\ncertain date and the basis therefor. (See DMNA form 1069 (Appendix\nL-2[A31]). (c) All persons who have\nreceived or reviewed the record shall be sent the same notice. (d) the procedures outlined in this\nregulation for notice, certificates of mailing or delivery, matters in\nextenuation, appeal or review, need not be followed when a suspension period is\nextended. (e) The mere extension of\na suspension period on a Wing or Group level is not subject to review, except\nfor legal sufficiency. Such actions shall not be forwarded to HQ\nNYANG. (v) The date of\nsuspension of a punishment should normally be the date of the imposition of the\npunishment which is being suspended, but any part of the punishment which\nremains unexecuted may be suspended at any time. (vi)\n\nReduction in grade or fine may be\nsuspended whether or not executed, at any time within four months after the\ndate of imposition. (a) If a fine has been\nexecuted, is later suspended and the suspension is thereafter automatically\nterminated, the money collected must be returned on the termination date, but\nwithout interest. (2)\n\nMitigation. This is defined as a\nreduction in either the quantity or the quality of punishment, and is\nappropriate when the offender has demonstrated, subsequent to the imposition of\nhis punishment, that his conduct merits a reduction in the severity of his\npunishment. (i) Unexecuted portions of\npunishment may be mitigated at any time. (ii)\n\nExecuted punishments may not be\nmitigated, except that an unsuspended reduction may be mitigated so long as the\naction is taken within a reasonable time after the punishment has been\nexecuted, normally not more than four months. (3)\n\nRemission is the action whereby any\nportion of the unexecuted punishment is cancelled, and is appropriate under the\nsame circumstances as mitigation. (i) At any\ntime before the execution of the punishment is completed, the unexecuted\nportion of the punishment may be remitted. (ii)\n\nWhile a suspended reduction may be\nremitted, there can be no remission of an unsuspended reduction since that\npunishment is executed at the time it is imposed. (4)\n\nSetting aside. This is an action whereby\nthe punishment or any part thereof, whether executed or unexecuted, is set\naside and any rights, privileges, and property affected by the imposition of\nthe punishment are restored. (i) This action\nis used in extreme cases where the facts and circumstances of the original\nmatter demonstrate that the punishment resulted in a clear injustice to the\noffender. Setting aside a punishment in its entirety restores the offender to\nthe position he was in before the non-judicial punishment action commenced, as\nif the action had never existed or the conduct providing the basis for the\naction had never occurred. (5)\n\nAny time a suspension occurs after the\ndate punishment was imposed, a suspension period has automatically terminated, or a punishment has been mitigated, remitted or set aside, at the Wing or Group\nlevel, the responsible commander shall, by letter, inform the commander, NYANG\nof same, specifying the name and unit of the offender, the punishment date and\nthe date and nature of the remedial action taken. (d) Effective date of\npunishment. (1)\n\nThe effective date of\nan unsuspended punishment is the date the punishment is imposed. The effective\ndate of a suspended punishment is the date of the suspension. (i) Although a punishment may be imposed and\nsuspended on the same date, sequentially punishment must come first. (ii)\n\nWhen a reduction is suspended, the\noffender is entitled to pay in the grade held immediately before the reduction, effective as of the date of suspension. (2)\n\nThe effective date of a vacated\nsuspension is the date of vacation. If a suspended reduction is vacated, the\noffender receives pay in the grade to which reduced when the punishment was\nimposed, effective on the date of vacation. (3)\n\nThe effective date of a mitigated\npunishment is the date of mitigation. If a reduction is mitigated, the offender\nis entitled to pay in the restored grade affective as of the date of\nmitigation. (4)\n\nThe effect of\nremitting or setting aside punishment is to cancel it effective as of the date\npunishment was imposed. If a reduction has been remitted or set aside, the\noffender is entitled to pay in the grade held immediately before the reduction, effective as of the date of imposition of punishment. (e) Date of rank. (1)\n\nIf the reduction is unsuspended, the date\nof rank in the reduced grade is the date the punishment was imposed. (2)\n\nIf the reduction is suspended, remitted, or set aside, the date of rank in the grade held before the reduction remains\nunchanged. (3)\n\nIf the reduction is\nmitigated, the date of rank in the restored grade is the date of the\nindorsement mitigating the punishment. (4)\n\nIf a suspended reduction is vacated, the\ndate of rank in the grade to which reduced before the suspension, is the date\nthe original reduction was imposed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
