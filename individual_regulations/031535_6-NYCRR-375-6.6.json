  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 375-6.6 - Soil cleanup objectives for the protection of ecological resources\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The soil cleanup objectives for protection of ecological resources must be\nconsidered and applied as set forth in this section for the upland soils at\nsites where terrestrial flora and fauna and the habitats that support them are\nidentified. (1)\n\nProtection of ecological\nresources soil cleanup objectives apply to sites or portions of sites where the\ndepartment determines: (i) ecological\nresources at or adjacent to a site, as set forth in subdivision (b) of this\nsection: (a) are present, or will be present\nunder the reasonably anticipated future use of the site; and\n(b) constitute an important component of the\nenvironment at, or in the vicinity of, the site; (ii)\nan impact or threat to the ecological\nresource has been identified as set forth in subdivision (c) of this section; and\n(iii)\nsoil contaminant\nconcentrations exceed the protection of ecological resources soil cleanup\nobjectives, as set forth in subdivision (d) of this section. (2)\n\nProtection of ecological\nresources soil cleanup objectives do not and/or will not apply to: (i) sites or portions of sites where the\ncondition of the land (e.g., paved, covered by impervious surfaces, buildings\nand other structures) precludes the existence of an ecological resource which\nconstitutes an important component of the environment; (ii)\nprotection of the aquatic environment; or\n(iii)\nsuch non-wild biota as: (a) pets or livestock; (b) agricultural or horticultural crops; and\n(c) landscaping in developed\nareas. (b) Identification of ecological resources. The presence of ecological resources shall be determined during the\ninvestigation of a site. (1)\n\nThe remedial\nparty for a remedial program undertaken pursuant to either Subpart 375-2 or\n375-4 of this Part shall conduct an ecological resource characterization as\npart of a fish and wildlife impact analysis according to department guidance to\ndocument the presence of fish, wildlife, plants and habitats both on and\nadjacent to the site. (2)\n\nThe\nremedial party for a remedial program undertaken pursuant to Subpart 375-3 of\nthis Part shall conduct a resource characterization as part of the qualitative\nexposure assessment required by ECL 27-1415(2)(b) and in accordance with\ndepartment guidance to document the presence of fish, wildlife, plants and\nhabitats both on and adjacent to the site. (3)\n\nThe department shall determine whether\nthe characterization conducted as set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision: (i) has identified ecological\nresources to be present at or adjacent to a site, or a portion thereof; and\n(ii)\nif such ecological\nresources constitute an important component of the environment at, or in the\nvicinity of, the site. (c) Consideration of impact or threat of\nimpact. If ecological resources that constitute an important component of the\nenvironment at, or adjacent to, the site are determined to be present the\nprotection of ecological resources soil cleanup objectives must be considered\nin the remedial program for the site. (1)\n\nAn\nimpact or threat of impact exists when: (i) a\nthreat to the environment exists, as set forth in section 375- 2.7(a)(1)(i) to\n(iv) of this Part, as a result of contaminants in the soil of the site, unless\nthe department determines that a more stringent cleanup is necessary to met the\nrequirements of section\n375-2.8\n(a) and\n(b)(1)\nof this Part; or\n(ii)\nan ecological resource is, or is\npotentially, impacted by contaminants in the soil of the site. (d) Soil cleanup\nobjectives. The protection of ecological resources soil cleanup objectives are\nthe same for both unrestricted and restricted use and are incorporated in the\nsoil cleanup objective tables. (1)\n\nFor an\nunrestricted use site, Table 375-6.8(a) of this Subpart presents the lower of\nthe protection of groundwater, ecological resources and unrestricted public\nhealth soil cleanup objectives, as calculated and presented in the technical\nsupport document. (2)\n\nFor a\nrestricted use site, Table 375-6.8(b) of this Subpart includes a protection of\necological resources column, which is applicable to a site regardless of the\nidentified use, as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section. (3)\n\nProtection of ecological resources soil\ncleanup objectives were not developed for contaminants identified in Table\n375-6.8(b) of this Subpart as \"NS\". For such contaminants, the applicant may be\nrequired to calculate a protection of ecological resources soil cleanup\nobjective for any site, as set forth in section\n375-6.9\nof this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n375-6.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
