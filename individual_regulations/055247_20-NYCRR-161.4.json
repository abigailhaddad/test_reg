  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 161.4 - Conditions for change of certain New York State elections not controlled by Federal elections\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following are the conditions under which a taxpayer\nmay change his election with respect to any of the matters listed in section\n161.3\n(a) of this Part: (a) The change of\nelection must be made by filing a complete amended New York State personal\nincome tax return for each taxable year involved, properly signed by each\ntaxpayer who made or agreed to the original election. If any other taxpayer was\nnot required to file a New York State personal income tax return by reason of\nthe original election, but is required to file a New York State personal income\ntax return by reason of the change of election, the amended New York State\npersonal income tax return by the taxpayer who filed originally must be\naccompanied by a New York State personal income tax return signed by such other\ntaxpayer. (b) Where the change of\nelection results in an underpayment of New York State personal income tax on\nthe part of any taxpayer required to file a New York State personal income tax\nreturn or amended New York State personal income tax return pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) of this section, any New York State personal income tax or\nadditional New York State personal income tax resulting from the change of\nelection will be deemed to have been assessed on the date of filing the\noriginal New York State personal income tax return, and the change will not be\neffective, unless all New York State personal income tax due from each such\ntaxpayer plus any interest thereon as required by section\n684\nof the Tax Law, is or has been paid at\nthe time of New York State personal income tax return or amended New York State\npersonal income tax return making the change of election is filed. For the\npurposes of this subdivision, an overpayment by one spouse will be treated as\npayment of New York State personal income tax due from the other spouse, provided the spouse who made the overpayment authorizes such application\nthereof. (c) Where the change of\nelection results in an overpayment of New York State personal income tax, the\n\nNew York State personal income tax return or amended New York State personal\nincome tax return required by subdivision (a) of this section will be deemed a\nclaim for refund for the purposes of section\n687\nof the Tax Law, but refund will be\nallowable only if such New York State personal income tax return or amended New\n\nYork State personal income tax return is filed within the time prescribed by\nsection\n687\nof the Tax Law, generally, three years\nfrom the filing of the New York State personal income tax return in which the\noriginal election was made, or two years from the payment of the New York State\npersonal income tax, whichever is later. To the extent that a change of\nelection serves or operates, as an offset, to reduce a deficiency of New York\n\nState personal income tax under section\n681\nof the Tax Law for the same taxable\nyear, such change of election is not deemed to result in an overpayment and\nsuch offset will be allowed without regard to the time limitation mentioned\nabove. Likewise, such time limitation will not apply to a change of election\nwhich, considered independently of any other adjustment for the taxable year, would have resulted in a deficiency or under-payment of New York State personal\nincome tax for such taxable year. (d) Where the proposed change of election\ninvolves a joint New York State personal income tax return of a husband and\nwife or separate New York State personal income tax returns of the spouses on\none form (either as the original New York State personal income tax return or\nas an amended New York State personal income tax return) and the sum of the\npayments by both spouses on the original New York State personal income tax\nreturn or returns exceeds the New York State personal income taxes dues after\ngiving effect to the change of election, refund of the excess may be made\npayable to both spouses. (e) If\nmore than one election is being changed for any taxable year, all such changes\nmay be shown in one New York State personal income tax return or amended New\n\nYork State personal income tax return for that year, filed by each taxpayer who\nmade or agreed to each of the original elections. (f) No change of election pursuant to this\nsection will be effective if disapproved by the Tax Commission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
