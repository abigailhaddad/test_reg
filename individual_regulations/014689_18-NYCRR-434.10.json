  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 434.10 - Evidence\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn any hearing under this Part: (a) Proof that the appellant abused or\nmaltreated one child is admissible evidence on the issue of whether the\nappellant abused or maltreated any other child. (b) Proof of injuries sustained by a child or\nproof of the condition of a child which is of such a nature as would ordinarily\nnot have occurred except by reason of the acts or omissions of the appellant is\nprima facie evidence that the child was abused or maltreated by the\nappellant. (c) Any writing, record\nor photograph, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as\na memorandum or record of any condition, act, transaction, occurrence or event\nrelating to a child in a child abuse or maltreatment proceeding by any hospital\nor any other public or private agency is admissible in evidence as proof of\nthat condition, act, transaction, occurrence or event, if the hearing officer\nfinds that it was made in the regular course of business of any hospital or any\nother public or private agency and that it was made in the regular course of\nsuch business at the time of the act, transaction, occurrence or event, or\nwithin a reasonable time thereafter. (d) Previous statements made by the child\nrelating to any allegations of abuse or maltreatment are admissible in\nevidence. The testimony of the child during the hearing is not necessary to\nsupport a finding of abuse or maltreatment. (e) Proof of the impairment of emotional\nhealth or impairment of mental or emotional condition as a result of the\nunwillingness or inability of the appellant to exercise a minimum degree of\ncare toward a child may include competent opinion or expert testimony and may\ninclude proof that such impairment lessened during a period when the child was\nin the care, custody or supervision of a person or agency other than the\nappellant. (f) A Family Court\nfinding, in a proceeding brought pursuant to article 10 of the Family Court\n\nAct, that a child has been abused or neglected is presumptive evidence that the\nreport of child abuse and maltreatment maintained by the Statewide Central\n\nRegister of Child Abuse and Maltreatment concerning such child is substantiated\nby a fair preponderance of the evidence if the allegations are the same; however, dismissal or withdrawal of a Family Court petition does not create a\npresumption that there is a lack of a fair preponderance of the evidence to\nprove that a child has been abused or maltreated for purposes of this\n\nPart. (g) An appellant may\nintroduce evidence to rebut any presumptions contained in this\nsection. (h) Some credible evidence\nis evidence that is worthy and capable of being believed. (i) Fair preponderance of evidence is\nevidence which outweighs other evidence which is offered to oppose\nit. (j) Relevant evidence is\nevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is at issue\nmore or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n434.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
