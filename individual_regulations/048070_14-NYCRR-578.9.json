  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 578.9 - A residential treatment facility for children and youth with inadequate cost experience\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Rates of\npayment for a residential treatment facility with inadequate cost experience\nshall be determined on the basis of satisfactory cost projections contained in\nbudgets and other information submitted to the commissioner by the residential\ntreatment facility. Budgets shall be submitted to the commissioner no later\nthan 120 days prior to the date on which the rates of payment will be\neffective. The form and content of any such budgets may vary as prescribed by\nthe commissioner. A residential treatment facility shall submit to the\ncommissioner, within 15 days of a written request therefor, any additional\ninformation the commissioner determines is necessary to compute or revise rates\nof payment in accordance with this section. (b) The rate of payment for a newly certified\nresidential treatment facility shall be computed from a budget report. The\nbudget report period shall cover the facility's first 12 months of operation. The commissioner may require that the budget be divided into several interim\nperiods during the first 12 months and be extended to include subsequent\nperiods, not to exceed an additional 12 months. The commissioner may further\nrequire specialized reports regarding staffing, utilization, capital costs, and\ncash flow. (1)\n\nFor a newly certified\nresidential treatment facility which expects to achieve a minimum average\nutilization of 90 percent during the first year of operation, the rate of\npayment shall be developed from the first 12-month budget report. (i) The budgeted operating and capital costs\nshall be reviewed to determine the allowed costs in accordance with the\nreimbursement principles contained in section\n578.14\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nThe operating portion of the allowed\ncost shall then be adjusted from the budget period to the period upon which the\ncost category standards were calculated using the applicable trend factors as\nspecified in section\n578.8\nof this Part, or as\ndetermined by the commissioner if trend factors are not specified for a\nparticular period. (iii)\n\nThe\nadjusted operating cost shall then be limited to the maximum amounts contained\nin the cost category standards from section\n578.8\n(a)(2)-(4)\nof this Part, and then trended to the appropriate rate period. (iv)\n\nThe operating per diem rate of payment\nshall be calculated based upon the total possible patient days of the\nresidential treatment facility at 90 percent utilization. (v) Capital costs shall be calculated on a\nper diem basis using the total possible patient days of the residential\ntreatment facility at 90 percent utilization. (2)\n\nFor a newly certified residential\ntreatment facility which expects an average utilization of less than 90 percent\nduring the first year of operation, the rate of payment shall be developed from\nthe budget report(s), and a utilization and staffing plan approved by the\ncommissioner. The plan shall estimate the month-by-month utilization and\nstaffing of the residential treatment facility for the first 12 months of\noperation, and for the second 12 months as applicable. In no instance shall the\nphased utilization plan exceed one year. (i) The budgeted operating and capital costs shall be reviewed to determine the\nallowed costs in accordance with the reimbursement principles contained in\nsection\n578.14\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nThe allowed operating cost shall then be\nadjusted from the budget period to the period upon which the cost category\nstandards were calculated using the applicable trend factors as specified in\nsection\n578.8\nof this Part, or as\ndetermined by the commissioner if trend factors are not specified for a\nparticular period. (iii)\n\nThe\nadjusted allowed cost shall then be limited to the maximum amounts as contained\nin the cost category standards from section\n578.8\n(a)(2)-(4)\nof this Part. The maximum amount for administration, maintenance and support\ncosts shall be the cost category per diem multiplied by the total possible\npatient days of the residential treatment facility at 90 percent utilization. Reimbursement is calculated by determining the lower of the adjusted allowed\nbudgeted cost or the maximum amount, and trending the result to the budget\nreport period. (iv)\n\nThe per diem\nrate of payment for operating and capital costs shall be calculated based upon\npatient days contained in the approved utilization plan. (v) More than one rate of payment may be\ncalculated to coincide with the residential treatment facility's planned\nutilization, and budgeted costs; which shall be determined at the\ncommissioner's discretion. (vi)\n\nThe\nresidential treatment facility shall submit monthly reports of actual\nutilization during the first year of operation. (vii)\n\nIf the residential treatment facility's\nactual monthly utilization significantly exceeds the residential treatment\nfacility's planned monthly utilization, the rates of payment shall be\nrecalculated using reimbursable operating and capital costs as determined in\nsubparagraphs (i)-(iii) of this paragraph, trended to the appropriate period, and divided by actual patient days. The commissioner may adjust retroactively\nor prospectively the residential treatment facility's rates of\npayment. (c) For a currently certified residential treatment facility increasing certified\nbed capacity by 20 percent or more, the rate of payment shall be determined in\naccordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section. However, the commissioner\nshall take into consideration the actual cost and patient day experience of the\nexisting residential treatment facility when reviewing budget(s), and shall\nexpect the reconfigured residential treatment facility to demonstrate economies\nof scale. (d) For a currently\ncertified residential treatment facility decreasing certified bed capacity by\n20 percent or more, the rate of payment may be computed using the facility's\nexisting reimbursement adjusted by the budgeted variable costs associated with\nthe decrease in certified capacity. Rate(s) of payment may be calculated to\nreflect a phase down period, and a budget based period thereafter. Each period\nmay not exceed 12 months. (1)\n\nRates of payment\ncalculated for the phase down period shall be developed from the residential\ntreatment facility's existing reimbursement, adjusted by any variable cost\ndecreases or extraordinary cost increases, and adjusted by the phase down\nutilization. More than one rate of payment may be calculated to coincide with\nthe facility's phase down period, which shall be determined at the\ncommissioner's discretion. (i) The existing\nrate of payment is multiplied by the patient days used in the calculation of\nthat rate of payment, resulting in a dollar amount of reimbursement. (ii)\n\nThe amount of reimbursement is adjusted\nby the applicable amount of variable cost decrease and the amount of any\nextraordinary cost associated with the phase down. (iii)\n\nThe total reimbursement is then divided\nby the product of the targeted certified capacity for the applicable period of\nthe phase down, multiplied by the number of days in the period and by a minimum\nutilization of 96 percent. (2)\n\nThe rate of payment for the subsequent\nbudget based period shall be developed from the residential treatment\nfacility's existing reimbursement, adjusted by any variable cost decreases or\nextraordinary cost increases, adjusted for inflation as appropriate, and\nadjusted to the staffing standards for medical/clinical and nursing categories, as approved by the commissioner. (i) The\nexisting rate of payment is multiplied by the patient days used in the\ncalculation of that rate of payment, resulting in a dollar amount of\nreimbursement. The reimbursement is then increased by an appropriate inflation\nfactor, as determined by the commissioner. (ii)\n\nThe amount of reimbursement is adjusted\nby the applicable amount of variable cost decrease and the amount of any\nextraordinary cost associated with the phase down. (iii)\n\nCosts for the medical/clinical and\nnursing categories are deleted, and are substituted as follows. Medical/clinical and nursing costs are computed using the full time equivalent\nstaffing standards, as approved by the commissioner, multiplied by the\nfacility's salary and fringe benefit cost experience. The resulting combined\namount is subject to the average salary and fringe benefit screens, as\nspecified in section\n578.8\n(a)(2)(ii) and\n(iii)\nof this Part, multiplied by the\napproved staffing standards. The cost data is made comparable by applying the\nappropriate trend factors as determined by the commissioner. (iv)\n\nCapital costs shall be updated in\naccordance with the approved costs as specified in section\n578.8\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Part. (v) The total\nreimbursement (the sum of immediately preceding subparagraphs [i] through [iv]\nof this paragraph) is then divided by the product of the certified capacity for\nthe phased down budget based period, multiplied by the number of days in the\nperiod and by a minimum utilization of 96 percent. (e) Financial reports pursuant to\nsection\n578.5\nof this Part shall be\nsubmitted within 120 days as follows in accordance with whichever is earlier, either: (1)\nthe first six-month period during\nwhich the residential treatment facility has operated at an average six-month\nutilization of at least 90 percent; or\n(2)\none year after the first resident was\nadmitted to the residential treatment facility. If the facility has not\nattained an average of 90 percent utilization in the first year of operation, the commissioner may adjust the report period to reflect a period where\nutilization has averaged 90 percent. (f) Upon submission of the financial reports\npursuant to subdivision (e) of this section, the commissioner may, at his\ndiscretion, adjust retroactively the residential treatment facility's\nbudget-based rate(s) of payment to more accurately reflect the costs of\noperating the facility. The facility shall receive the lower of its actual cost\nor its budget based rate of payment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
