  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 58-2.23 - HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody testing results\n\nState Regulations\n\nNo blood bank shall inform any blood or plasma donor or his/her heath care provider of the results of HIV-1, HIV-2 or HIV-1/HIV-2 combination antibody screening tests unless such results are negative, with the exception of autogeneic donors, whose heath care provider may be informed of screening test results if there is insufficient time prior to surgery for completion of supplemental testing, provided that such heath care provider is instructed that the donor may not be informed that he or she is positive for HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies based on the incomplete results. Initial reactive screening tests shall be repeated in duplicate. If two of three screening tests are reactive, the sample shall be considered repeatedly reactive, and supplemental testing shall be performed. Notification that a donor is positive shall be made only if the results have been reactive for more than one screening test, and the supplemental HIV antibody test result has been unequivocally positive. Appropriate counseling of donors regarding the significance of all test results must be available. HIV results must be reported to donors if the results are substantiated as positive, or upon supplemental testing show an increased likelihood of representing seroconversion to positive, as determined by the director of the laboratory performing the supplemental testing. This report must be made in person unless repeated efforts to encourage a donor to come in have failed, in which case notification may be made by certified restricted delivery mail. HIV results that are substantiated as negative, or upon supplemental testing are indeterminate but do not show an increased likelihood of representing seroconversion to positive, as determined by the director of the laboratory performing the supplemental testing, may be reported to donors by mail, provided that such donors are not informed that they are seropositive. Any notification of HIV results to donors who were repeatedly reactive on initial screening tests, regardless of the results of supplemental testing, must include an offer of appropriate counseling.
