  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7210.6 - Procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior approval\nof the commission shall precede the transfer of an inmate from one facility to\nanother facility. Whenever a facility administrator determines that it is\nnecessary to transfer an inmate or group of inmates to another suitable place\nor facility, he shall contact the commission by telephone or other means and\nrequest a substitute jail order. When such request is made at a time other than\nduring the normal business hours of the commission, it shall be referred to the\nofficer of the day assigned by the commission. (b) It shall be the responsibility of the\nadministrator of an affected facility to identify another facility or a\nsuitable place within the county which may be designated as a substitute jail\nfor such facility. If such suitable place exists, he shall communicate its\nexistence to the commission. (c) If\nthere is no suitable place in the county to which the inmate or group of\ninmates may be transferred, the facility administrator shall determine whether\nthe county jail of another county is able to accommodate the inmate or group of\ninmates. The facility administrator shall take into account such factors as the\nability of the county jail of another county to house the inmate or group of\ninmates in a manner consistent with applicable standards, the proximity of such\ncounty jail to the county jail or his county, the potential inconvenience to\nthe family and friends of the inmate whose transfer is contemplated, access to\nlegal counsel and other resources, and the ability of the receiving suitable\nplace or facility to provide proper security and supervision of the\ninmates. (d) The facility\nadministrator shall provide the commission or its representative with all\npertinent information needed to determine whether a substitute jail order\nshould be granted. Upon the commission's approval for transfer and an assurance\nby the facility administrator of the receiving facility that he will house the\ninmates, the facility administrator of the sending facility shall make the\nnecessary arrangements to effectuate the transfer. (e) (1)\n\nWhenever due to extraordinary circumstances the facility administrator of a\nfacility reasonably believes that the safety or security of an inmate or group\nof inmates committed to his custody cannot be maintained and that the public\nsafety and security would be preserved by a transfer of the said inmate or\ngroup of inmates to an institution, the facility administrator shall make a\nwritten request to the commissioner to make available an institution for the\nconfinement of such inmate or group of inmates. Upon the written determination\nof the commissioner that such institution is available for the confinement of\nsuch inmate or group of inmates, the facility administrator shall cause the\nsaid inmate or group of inmates to be transferred to the custody of the\ncommissioner. The facility administrator shall provide immediate written\nnotification to the commissioner of the transfer of the said inmate or group of\ninmates. The commissioner shall immediately forward to the commission a copy of\nthe written transfer request and other papers upon which his determination was\nmade, along with a copy of his written determination. (2)\n\nThe commissioner shall take custody of\nany inmate transferred pursuant to this Part and shall house such inmates in\nthe most proximate available institution, taking into account the security\nneeds of the inmates and of the community. The legal custody of the said\ninmates shall remain with the facility administrator. (3)\n\nThe facility administrator shall assess\nthe conditions of his facility and immediately request the commissioner to\nreturn the inmates to the sending facility once the facility is able to\naccommodate the inmates and their confinement in an institution is no longer\nneeded. If the facility administrator determines that his facility is\ninappropriate for the return of the transferred inmates, he shall make every\neffort to find another suitable facility for the confinement of the said\ninmates. If such facility is available, he shall request the commission to\ndesignate it as a substitute jail, and the commission shall make the\nappropriate designation. If no suitable facility is available, the facility\nadministrator shall notify the commissioner of this fact in writing within 30\ndays of the transfer of the inmate or group of inmates to his custody and shall\nrequest the commissioner to extend the transfer for an additional 30 days. The\ncommissioner, in his discretion, shall consent in writing to the extension. If\nconsent to the extension is granted, the commissioner shall send the request\nfor such extension and his written consent to the commission. The commission\nshall approve such application if it is satisfied that a suitable facility is\nnot available. Such application for extension may be made and approved at\n30-day intervals thereafter until the said inmates are either transferred to a\nsuitable facility or are released from the custody of the facility\nadministrator of the sending facility.
