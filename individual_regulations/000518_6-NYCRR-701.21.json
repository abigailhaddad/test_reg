  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 701.21 - Criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In assigning\ndischarge restriction categories, the department will consider factors\nincluding the size of the waterbody, the nature of the surrounding district\nincluding the watershed, and the uses and quality of the waters. The department\nwill also weigh the need for the additional water quality protection of the\ndischarge restriction categories as compared with the assigned standards and\nbest uses and the likelihood that the discharge restriction category will\ncontribute to achieving the protection goals. (b) As appropriate, additional consideration\nmay be given to: (1)\nthe potential effects of\nadditional discharges from new, expanded, or changed facilities or activities\non the water quality value of resource; (2)\nthe risk to the waters or the use of the\nwaters from unintended or incidental discharges from new facilities; and\n(3)\nthe potential effects of\nphysical accumulation or bioaccumulation of substances not addressed by ambient\nstandards. (c) Substantial weight will be given to obtaining consistency with provisions of\nexisting watershed management or protection plans adopted or certified by the\n\nState or an entity of local government. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n701.21\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
