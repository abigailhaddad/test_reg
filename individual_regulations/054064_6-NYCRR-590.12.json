  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 590.12 - Hardship cases\n\nState Regulations\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions contained in this\n\nPart, the commissioner is authorized in hardship cases to make advance payments\nin anticipation of the eligible person actually completing his or her moving of\npersonal property or actually purchasing or renting and occupying decent, safe\nand sanitary replacement housing. The commissioner may authorize the advance\npayment of the amount determined by him or her to represent reasonable and\nnecessary moving expenses or the amount of the approved supplemental relocation\npayment deemed necessary to purchase or rent decent, safe and sanitary\nreplacement housing. In the case of a supplemental relocation payment, payment\ncan only be made if there is a signed contract for the purchase of a\nreplacement property, or in the case of a replacement rental unit, if there is\na signed lease or some other firm commitment. In both instances, the proposed\nreplacement housing must be inspected prior to payment for a determination of\ncompliance with decent, safe and sanitary standards. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n590.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
