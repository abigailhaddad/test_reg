However, a participating employer may require the\nemployee to complete up to six months of service before coverage for the\nemployee and the employee's eligible dependents becomes effective. (3)\n\nCoverage for any employee and his\ndependents shall cease without notice on the date of termination of his status\nas an employee as defined in section\n73.1\nof this Part. The status of\nany person as an employee shall be deemed to terminate upon his severance from\nthe payroll, except that, for the purpose of continuing his coverage under the\nplan, the status of such person as an employee shall be deemed to continue: (i) during any period of authorized leave\nwithout pay or while a vested employee; (ii)\nduring any period for which payment of\nbenefits is made under a State income protection plan; (iii)\nduring any period, not to exceed one\nyear or until reemployment by the State or reemployment by another employer, whichever first occurs, or such shorter period as may be established by\ncollective negotiations, in which the employee is suspended and his name is\nplaced on a preferred list for reinstatement; provided, however, that such\ncontinuance shall be permissive for any participating employer; (iv)\nin the event of the employee's\nretirement, if the employee has completed at least five years of service with\nthe employer from whose service the employee has retired if such employee was\nhired prior to April 1, 1975 and such employer elected to participate in the\nplan prior to March 1, 1972; provided further that an employer may establish a\nservice requirement greater than five years for purposes of determining\neligibility for retirement for any employee hired after April 1, 1975 and may\nelect not to provide continuance of coverage for any employee hired on or after\n\nApril 1, 1977. An employer so electing shall agree to do so for all employees\nor all employees in a class or category who, on retirement, meet the conditions\nspecified; (v) in the event of the\nretirement of an employee who has met the conditions specified in subparagraph\n(iv) of this paragraph from the service of an employer which elected to\nparticipate in the plan on or after March 1, 1972, if such employer elects, at\nits option, to treat such retiree as an employee. An employer so electing shall\nagree to do so for all employees who, on retirement, meet the conditions\nspecified in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph; (vi)\nin the event of the employee's\nretirement with less than five years of service with the employer from whose\nservice the employee has retired, or less service than established by such\nemployer, pursuant to subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, such employer, at\nits option, may provide for the continuance of coverage for such employee, provided that the applicable period of required service has been met through\nemployment with one or more public employers and such employee has served a\nminimum of one year with the employer from whose service the employee has\nretired. An employer so electing to provide continuance of coverage shall agree\nto do so for all employees or all employees in a class or category who, on\nretirement, meet the conditions specified; (vii)\nin the event the employee is, or has\nbeen, granted a service-connected disability retirement by a retirement or\npension plan or system administered and operated by the State of New York or a\ncivil division thereof, including the New York State Teachers' Retirement\n\nSystem, regardless of the employee's service with the employer; (viii)\nin the event of the retirement of an\nunpaid local elective official with 20 years or more service in such position\nwith a participating employer that elects to permit enrollment for such\nofficials, or an unpaid local elective official who has at least five or more\nyears service with a participating employer and who also meets or exceeds a\nlocally established service requirement which is not less than that established\nfor other employees of that locality; or\n(ix)\nin the event of the retirement of a\npublicly elected member of a school board with 20 years' or more service in\nsuch position with a participating employer that elects to permit enrollment\nfor such members. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions, coverage under the plan for any\nperson whose status as an employee terminates may continue for the period for\nwhich the required contributions of both the employee and the employer on\naccount of such coverage were made, provided such contributions were payable to\nthe Health Insurance Fund on or prior to the date of the termination of the\nstatus of such person as an employee. However, a participating employer may\nestablish that coverage for any category of employees will cease on the last\nday of the month during which status as an employee terminates. In the event\nthat no contributions are required of an employee for such coverage, coverage\nunder the plan may continue, in the case of an employee paid on a biweekly\nbasis, through the 28th day following the last day of the last payroll period\nduring which the employee was employed and, in the case of an employee paid on\na monthly basis, through the last day of the calendar month next following the\nlast month during which the employee was employed, unless an earlier\ntermination date for a particular category of employees has been\nestablished. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding\nany of the foregoing provisions of this section, if the regular work schedule\nof an employee has been not less than 20 hours per week for at least one year\nand then is reduced to less than 20 hours per week under circumstances not\nexpressly excepted under section\n73.1\n(c)(1)\nof this\n\nPart, the president may, in his discretion and upon the request of the\nemployer, deem such person's status as an employee to continue for a period not\nexceeding one year for the purpose of continuing his coverage under the plan. Thereafter, if the regular work schedule of such employee continues to be less\nthan 20 hours per week, the president may, from time to time, review the case\nand, in his discretion, grant extensions not exceeding one year each during\nwhich such person's status as an employee may be deemed to continue. (6)\n(i) In\nthe event both husband and wife elect coverage under the plan as employees as\ndefined in section\n73.1\nof this Part, there shall be\ncoordination of benefits. (ii)\n\nNo\nemployee may elect coverage under the plan with more than one employer. A\nperson having elected coverage with two or more employers shall terminate\ncoverage with all but one of such employers. If the employee does not do so\nforthwith, the employee shall be deemed to terminate coverage with all but the\nemployer with whom coverage was first acquired. (7)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of\nthis Part for the purpose of determining an employee's eligibility to apply\naccumulated but unused sick leave credits against the employee's cost of health\ninsurance in retirement, an employee whose services are terminated on account\nof the abolition of positions in the State service and who retires within one\nyear following such termination, shall be deemed to have been on leave without\npay and thus eligible to have such credits applied. (b) Continued coverage of dependents on death\nof employee or retired employee. (1)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this Part in the event of the death of\nan employee or retired employee for whom charges are paid on a biweekly basis, the coverage hereunder of his dependents shall continue, following the payroll\nperiod in which death occurs, for the payroll periods for which contributions\nwere made by such employee for coverage of such dependents and, in addition, thereafter, for the five next succeeding payroll periods. If such coverage has\nbeen provided by the employer without cost to the employee or retired employee, the coverage of such dependents shall continue for the seven biweekly payroll\nperiods next succeeding the payroll period in which the employee's death\noccurs. In the event of the death of an employee or retired employee for whom\ncharges are paid on a monthly basis, the coverage hereunder of his dependents\nshall continue, following the month in which death occurs, for the month or\nmonths for which contributions were made by such employee or retired employee\nfor coverage of such dependents and, in addition, thereafter for the two next\nsucceeding months, but in no event shall coverage extended under this paragraph\nexceed the three-month period next succeeding the month in which the employee's\nor retired employee's death occurs. If such coverage has been provided by the\nemployer without cost to the employee or retired employee, the coverage of such\ndependents shall continue for the three-month period next succeeding the month\nin which the employee's or retired employee's death occurs. (2)\n\nWhere the circumstances of death of the\ncovered employee are such that an accidental death benefit from a retirement\nsystem or pension plan administered by the State or a civil division or a death\nbenefit under the Workers' Compensation Law is payable, dependents shall be\neligible for continued coverage, following expiration of the period of coverage\nprovided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, in accordance with and subject\nto the provisions of subdivision 2 of section\n165\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law. If an application or claim has been made for an accidental\ndeath benefit from a retirement system or pension plan or for death benefits\nunder the Workers' Compensation Law, such dependents shall be eligible for\ncontinued coverage under this paragraph pending determination of such\napplication or claim and provided the same is diligently prosecuted by the\napplicant or claimant. Coverage of dependents may be continued under this\nparagraph only if written application for such continued coverage is filed with\nthe Department of Civil Service within 90 days after the death of the employee. In the case of dependents of an employee who died before July 1, 1964, such\ndependents who would otherwise be eligible for coverage under subdivision 2 of\nsection\n165\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law if such section had been in effect at the time of such death\nshall be eligible for coverage under the plan, provided written application for\nsuch coverage is filed with the Department of Civil Service on or before\n\nDecember 31, 1964. Coverage of dependents of a deceased employee under this\nparagraph may be continued only for so long as such dependents would otherwise\nbe eligible for coverage if the employee had lived and continued to be covered\nin the health insurance plan, and the surviving spouse for only so long as he\nor she remains unremarried. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this Part, in the event of the death of\nan employee or retired employee on or after September 1, 1968, who was an\nemployee of the State and/or of a political subdivision thereof for not less\nthan 10 years and who had been a participant in any of the health insurance\nplans, the unremarried spouse of such deceased employee or retired employee\nand/or the other qualified dependents, if any, may elect in writing to continue\ntheir present health insurance coverage, provided that the election to continue\nsuch coverage and tender of a premium payment equal to one quarter of the full\nshare annual premium is made prior to the cessation of such coverage. If the\nspouse has remarried at the time of the election to continue coverage or\nremarries at any time after the election, he or she is ineligible to continue\nin the plan, but the other dependents, if any, may continue in the plan as\nprovided by this Part. (c) Prior retirees. Upon the extension of the\nplan to prior retirees of an employer, each such prior retiree shall be\neligible for coverage under the plan for himself and his dependents, if any, subject to the provisions of this Part and of the appropriate contracts\napplicable to prior retirees and their dependents, provided he makes\napplication for such coverage within the time specified therefor by the\npresident. (d) Cessation of\neligibility upon termination of the plan or participation of employer. Upon the\ntermination of the plan by the State, or of the status of an employer as a\nparticipating employer by reason of default in the payment of charges, or by\nwithdrawal or expulsion or otherwise, the coverage and eligibility for coverage\nof its employees and retired employees shall cease as of the end of the last\nperiod for which the required contributions of both employer and employee have\nbeen paid to the Health Insurance Fund. (e) Disqualification. The president may\ndisqualify from participation in the health insurance plan and from receiving\nbenefits thereunder any employee or retired employee or dependent of an\nemployee or retired employee who has secured or attempted to secure\nparticipation in the health insurance plan or benefits under the plan for\nhimself or another by fraud, deception or a false statement of a material fact, or who has accepted benefits for himself or another knowing he was not entitled\nthereto. No person shall be disqualified or denied benefits pursuant to this\nsubdivision unless he is first given a written statement of the reasons\ntherefor and afforded an opportunity to make an explanation and submit facts in\nopposition to such action. Such employee, retired employee or dependent of an\nemployee or retired employee may be restored to eligibility for coverage under\nthe plan only on approval of the president and subject to such conditions as\nmay be imposed by the president, including repayment of sums expended for\nbenefits obtained by fraud, deception or false statement of a material fact, or\naccepted by the employee with knowledge that he was not entitled\nthereto.
