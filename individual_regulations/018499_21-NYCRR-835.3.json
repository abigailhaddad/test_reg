Tit. 21 § 835.3 - Form of request\n\nState Regulations\nA request for a hearing may be informal but shall indicate\nthe name of the individual and the address to which an acknowledgment may be\ndirected. It may be stated in such detail as the objector may elect. The\nrequest shall be deemed filed only upon receipt by the commission.

The report shall be\nrequired by notice in writing served upon the objector by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the person or entity filing the request\nfor hearing at the place indicated in the request.
