  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 608.2 - Procedures and requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nutility shall allocate annually to its own VSR undergrounding fund an amount\nequal to the greater of: (1)\nthe average of\nits annual expenditures on the underground installation of new underground\ndistribution and feeder facilities within residential subdivisions for the\nyears 1985, 1986 and 1987; or\n(2)\n0.14 percent of its 1987 local service revenues. The amount to be allocated to\nthe fund shall be adjusted for inflation each year according to the Handy-\nWhitman Index. The amount in the fund is the utility's maximum obligation in a\ngiven year. Each utility shall install or provide for the installation of new\nunderground distribution and feeder facilities under this Part unless it has\nexpended its maximum obligation in a given year. Each utility shall spend up to\nsuch maximum obligation on its share of the cost of installing such facilities\nunderground that exceeds what an applicant for a line extension would have paid\nfor facilities had the area not been designated as a VSR. If a utility spends\nin excess of its maximum obligation in a particular year, the excess shall\nreduce its maximum obligation of the following year by the amount of such\nexcess. After a utility spends its maximum obligation in a particular year, additional VSR undergrounding is not required. If a utility does not spend its\nmaximum obligation in a given year, any unspent portion shall be carried over\nto the next year. (b) In\naddition to other procedures which may apply in connection with the proposed\nconstruction of a particular distribution or feeder facility: (1)\n\nIf a utility has not expended its maximum\nobligation as described in subdivision (a) of this section in a particular year\nwhen it chooses to propose, or receives a written application for service to a\npremises which necessitates the new construction of distribution or feeder\nfacilities on any public or private land in a VSR, the utility shall provide a\nwritten report to the agency which designated or administers the VSR and any\nagency having jurisdiction over affected public land and the commission of its\nintention to install the necessary distribution or feeder facilities\nunderground or overhead (including a project description and consideration of\nthe factors set forth in subdivision [j] of this section), at least 60 days\nbefore construction is planned to commence. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, a utility may provide the written report\ndescribed therein within 30 days after the commencement of construction if the\nnecessary distribution or feeder facilities are installed overhead on a\ntemporary basis, pending the review of the utility's report if the visual\nimpact of the temporary service is mitigated, to the extent appropriate, after\nthe procedures of this section are followed. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, a utility may install permanent overhead\nfacilities if the utility, before installation: (i) determines that the situation is an\nemergency; and\n(ii)\nobtains the\nwritten approval of the appropriate agency(ies); and\n(iii)\nupon written request, obtains the\nwritten approval of the Secretary of the Commission. (4)\n\nIf undergrounding is otherwise required\nin a VSR, and if the per-foot cost of installing the necessary facilities will\nbe greater than two times the charge per foot set forth in the utility's\ntariff, the utility or the applicant may petition the Secretary of the\n\nCommission to allow overhead installation. Approvals shall be granted or denied based on economic, engineering, environmental, emergency or hardship conditions. (c) Unless the agency(ies)\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of this section provide(s) written notification\nin-hand to both the utility and the commission objecting to the utility's\nproposal within 30 days after receipt of the utility's report, the utility may\ninstall the facilities in question as contemplated in its report. The utility\nmay also proceed as contemplated in its report within such 30-day period if the\nagency(ies) provide(s) written notification to both the utility and the\ncommission concurring with the utility's proposal. (d) If the agency(ies) described in\nsubdivision (b) of this section provide(s) written notification in-hand to both\nthe utility and the commission objecting to the utility's proposal (including a\ndetailed explanation of such objection) within 30 days after receipt of the\nutility's report, the commission shall review the report and notification(s)\nfiled by the utility and agency(ies). (e) Unless the commission serves on the\nutility an order requiring the installation of the facilities in question to be\nperformed in a different manner than that contemplated by the utility within 30\ndays after the commission's receipt of the agency's notification pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of this section, the utility may install such facilities as\ncontemplated in its report. The utility may also proceed as contemplated in its\nreport within such 30-day period if the commission serves on it an order\nconcurring with the utility's proposal. (f) If an agency referred to in subdivision\n(h) of this section intends to supply a map(s) of a VSR(s) listed in such\nsubdivision to the affected utility(ies) and the commission, such agency shall\nconsult with such utility(ies) and the commission staff as to the appropriate\nscale(s) and other details of such map(s). (g) If an agency referred to in subdivision\n(h) of this section has a VSR map prepared before the effective date of these\nregulations, such map may be filed with the commission and utilities without\nconsultation if the map otherwise complies with section\n608.1\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Title. (h) A VSR is: (1)\none of the following resources which is\ndesignated as having high scenic quality: (i) scenic areas of statewide significance (in coastal areas) designated by the\n\nSecretary of State pursuant to article 42 of the Executive Law; (ii)\n\nAdirondack Park scenic vistas, designated by the Adirondack Park Agency, identified on the private land use\nand development plan map and listed in the State Land Master Plan for the\n\nAdirondack Park pursuant to article 27 of the Executive Law; (iii)\nscenic roads, designated by the\n\nCommissioner of Environmental Conservation pursuant to article 49 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law; (iv)\nscenic districts, designated by the\n\nCommissioner of Environmental Conservation pursuant to article 49 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law; (v) State and national wild and scenic river areas administered respectively by\neither the Department of Environmental Conservation or the Adirondack Park\n\nAgency pursuant to article 15 of the Environmental Conservation Law, and by the\n\nDepartment of the Interior, pursuant to\n16 U.S.C. section\n1271; and\n(vi)\n\nAreas of Exceptional Scenic Beauty, acquired pursuant to the 1986 Environmental Quality Bond Act and administered\nby the Department of Environmental Conservation. (2)\nany area in one of the following\nresources which is determined to have high scenic quality by the agency with\njurisdiction over the affected resource as long as such determination is filed\nwith the commission: (i) State Nature and\n\nHistoric Preserve areas designated by the Legislature. (ii)\n\nState parks, which were so designated\nfor their scenic quality by the Legislature, the Department of Environmental\n\nConservation or the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, including the Adirondack and Catskill Parks. (iii)\n\nLake George Park, except incorporated\nvillages, administered by the Lake George Park Commission, pursuant to article\n43 of the Environmental Conservation Law. (iv)\n\nParks within New York State administered\nby the Palisades Interstate Park Commission pursuant to article 9 of the Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law. (v) State historic sites owned by the Office\nof Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation under article 19 of the Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law and Title 9 NYCRR Part\n384. (vi)\nnational historic sites, national\nseashores and national recreation areas located in New York State and operated\nby the National Park Service. (i) The listing of VSRs in subdivision (h) of\nthis section constitutes a determination that the new construction of\ndistribution or feeder facilities underground is generally more appropriate\ntherein than elsewhere. Neither such listing nor any agency's provision of a\nmap of a given VSR to the affected utility and the commission, however, creates\na presumption that construction of particular distribution or feeder facilities\nunderground is appropriate. The propriety of such construction will, instead, be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in subdivisions\n(b)-(e) of this section. (j) In\nevaluating the utility's proposal pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section, the commission will consider such factors as: (1)\nthe nature of the visual setting in the\nvicinity of the proposed construction, including the character of existing or\nproposed adjacent structures or land areas, unless a governmental authority\nwith jurisdiction has plans to improve the scenic quality of the area in\nquestion; (2)\nthe probable\nenvironmental effects associated with both overhead and underground\nconstruction; (3)\nany expected\nengineering difficulties associated with both overhead and underground\nconstruction; and\n(4)\nthe estimated\ncost associated with both overhead and underground construction. (k) In the event a utility either\nintends at its own discretion or is required pursuant to this section to place\na distribution facility underground, it shall inform the electric company and\ncable television company serving the area in which the underground construction\nis to be located. If a new common access route from existing facilities to the\nlocation of such underground construction will be used, the portions of the\nconnecting facilities of the utility and the electric company that are located\nin a VSR shall be placed underground. (l) Any delays caused by a utility's\ncompliance with this Part shall be omitted from the counts of service standards\nmeasurements in section\n603.12\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. (m) To the extent\npracticable, underground electric, communication, gas and cable television\nfacilities shall be installed in a common trench when new construction is, or\ncan without undue difficulty, be made simultaneously. Every reasonable effort\nshall be made to use joint occupancy utility poles to accommodate electric, communication and cable television facilities when new overhead construction\noccurs. (n) Any interested agency\nor person may petition the commission to add additional categories to the VSR\nlist of subdivision (h) of this section. The commission will approve or\ndisapprove addition of the proposed category based on whether the category fits\nwithin the VSR definition in section\n604.1\n(k)(1)\nof\nthis Title. (o) The VSR program\nshall be evaluated by the commission after the program has been in effect for\ntwo years. Utilities shall submit to the department within six months after the\nprogram has been in effect for two years, details of their experience with the\nprogram including: all locations of line extension construction in VSRs, the\ntotal length of all facilities undergrounded in VSRs, costs incurred by the\nutility, costs incurred by applicants for their share of line extension costs, problems encountered with the program, suggestions for changes to the program, or any other information the utility deems relevant to evaluation of the VSR\nprogram. The department staff and/or the commission may request, and the\nutilities shall provide, any information the commission or staff deem relevant\nto evaluation of the VSR program. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
