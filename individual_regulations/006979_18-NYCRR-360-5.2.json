Work may be considered substantial even if performed part-time, and even if it\nis less responsible than the individual's former work, and it may be considered\ngainful if it pays less than former work. The application of this definition\nand of the amount of earnings that could result in a finding or deeming of\nsubstantial gainful activity must be in accordance with applicable Federal\nregulations.
