  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2503.4 - Failure to maintain services as certified\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\nA\ntenant may apply to the division for a reduction of the legal regulated rent to\nthe level in effect prior to the most recent adjustment under section\n2502.5\n(c) of this\n\nTitle, subject to the limitations of subdivisions (b) through (g) of this\nsection, and the division may so reduce the rent where it is found that the\nowner has failed to maintain the services. If the division further finds that\nthe owner has knowingly filed a false certification, it shall, in addition to\nabating the rent, assess the owner with the reasonable costs of the proceeding\nincluding attorney's fees, and impose a penalty not in excess of $250 for each\nfalse certification. (2)\n\nWhere an\napplication for a temporary rent adjustment pursuant to a major capital\nimprovement as set forth in section\n2502.4\n(b) of this\n\nTitle has been granted, and collection of such rent adjustment commenced prior\nto the effective date of the rent reduction order, the owner will not be\npermitted to continue to collect the rent adjustment while the rent reduction\norder is in effect. (b) Except for complaints pertaining to heat and hot water or other conditions\nrequiring emergency repairs, before filing an application for a reduction of\nthe legal regulated rent pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, a tenant\nshould notify the owner or the owner's agent in writing of all the service\nproblems listed in such application. A copy of the written notice to the owner\nor agent with proof of mailing or delivery should be attached to the\napplication. Applications should be filed with the division no earlier than 10\ndays after such notice is given to the owner or agent. Failure to provide such\nprior written notice will not be grounds for dismissal of the application. Applications based upon a lack of adequate heat or hot water must be\naccompanied by a report from the appropriate city agency finding such lack of\nadequate heat or hot water. (c) (1)\n\nIn the event notice of any inspection is\ngiven by the division in a proceeding commenced pursuant to this section, the\ninspection shall be conducted on notice to both the owner and tenant. (2)\n\nUpon receipt of a copy of the tenant's\ncomplaint from the division, an owner shall have 20 days in which to respond if\nthe tenant provided the division with the proof of the written notice to the\nowner. If the tenant did not provide proof of written notice to the owner, an\nowner shall have 60 days in which to respond. If the tenant's complaint\nindicates that the tenant has been forced to vacate the premises, the owner\nshall have five days to respond. If the complaint pertains to heat and hot\nwater or to a condition which in the division's opinion may require emergency\nrepairs, the owner shall have 20 days to respond. Nothing herein shall preclude\nthe division from granting an owner's request for a reasonable extension of\ntime to respond in order to establish that service problems have been repaired. If during this period of time, an owner has attempted, but been unable to\nobtain access to the subject housing accommodation to correct the service or\nequipment deficiency, the owner should set forth such facts in the response. Upon receipt thereof, in order to facilitate the resolution of the complaint, the division may direct an inspector to accompany the owner or the owner's\nagent to the housing accommodation to determine whether such access is being\nprovided. In order for the division to coordinate the inspection, the owner\nshould indicate that access has been denied in the response submitted to the\ndivision and should include copies of two letters to the tenant attempting to\narrange for access. Each of the letters must have been mailed at least eight\ndays prior to the date proposed for access, and must have been mailed by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested. Exceptions to such requirements for\ninspection may be permitted under emergency conditions, where special\ncircumstances exist, or pursuant to court order. The service complaint, or\nobjection to a rent restoration application, by a tenant who fails to provide\naccess at the time arranged by the division for the inspection will be\ndenied. (d) Certain\nconditions complained of as constituting a decrease in an essential service may\nbe de minimis in nature, and therefore do not rise to the level of a failure to\nmaintain an essential service for the purposes of this section. Such conditions\nare those that have only a minimal impact on tenants, do not affect the use and\nenjoyment of the premises, and may exist despite regular maintenance of\nservices. The following schedule sets forth conditions that will generally not\nconstitute a failure to maintain an essential service. However, this schedule\nis not intended to be exclusive, and is not determinative in all cases and\nunder all circumstances. Therefore, it does not include all conditions that may\nbe considered de minimus, and there may be circumstances where a condition, although included on the schedule, will nevertheless be found to constitute a\ndecrease in an essential service. SCHEDULE OF DE MINIMIS CONDITIONS\nBUILDING-WIDE CONDITIONS\n1. AIR CONDITIONING: Failure to provide in lobby, hallways, stairwells, and\nother nonenclosed public areas. 2.

(e) In determining\nwhether a condition is de minimis, the division may consider the passage of\ntime during which a disputed service was not provided and during which no\ncomplaint was filed by any tenant alleging failure to maintain such disputed\nservice, as evidencing that such service condition is de minimis, and therefore\ndoes not constitute a failure to maintain an essential service, provided that: (1)\nfor purposes of this subdivision, the\npassage of four years or more shall be considered presumptive evidence that the\ncondition is de minimis, with such four-year period to be measured without\nreference to any changes in building ownership or the tenancy of the subject\nhousing accommodation; and\n(2)\nservices required to be provided by laws or regulations other than the act or\nthis Subchapter shall not be subject to this subdivision. (f) (1)\n\nExcept as to complaints of inadequate heat and/or hot water, or applications\nrelating to the restoration of rents based upon the restoration of such\nservices, whenever a complaint of building-wide reduction in services, or an\nowner's application relating to the restoration of rents based upon the\nrestoration of such services is filed, the tenants or owner may submit with the\ncomplaint, answer or application, the contemporaneous affidavit of an\nindependent licensed architect or engineer, substantiating the allegations of\nthe complaint, answer, or application. The affidavit shall state that the\nconditions that are the subject of the complaint, answer or application were\ninvestigated by the person signing the affidavit and that the conditions exist\nor do not exist. The affidavit shall specify what conditions were investigated\nand what the findings were with respect to each condition. The affidavit shall\nstate when the investigation was conducted, must be submitted within a\nreasonable time after the completion of the investigation, and when served by\nthe division on the opposing party, will raise a rebuttable presumption that\nthe conditions that are the subject of the complaint, answer or application\nexist, or do not exist. (2)\n\nThe\npresumption raised by the affidavit may be rebutted only on the basis of\npersuasive evidence, including a counter affidavit by an independent licensed\narchitect or engineer, or a report of a subsequent inspection conducted, or a\nsubsequent violation imposed by a governmental agency, or an affirmation signed\nby 51 percent of the complaining tenants. Except for good cause shown, failure\nto rebut the presumption within 30 days will result in the issuance of an order\nwithout any further physical inspection of the premises by the\ndivision. (3)\n\nThere must be no\ncommon ownership, or other financial interest, between such architect or\nengineer and the owner or tenants, and the affidavit shall state that there is\nno such relationship or other financial interest. The affidavit must also\ncontain a statement that the architect or engineer did not engage in the\nperformance of any work, other than the investigation, relating to the\nconditions that are the subject of the affidavit, and must contain the original\nsignature and professional stamp of the architect or engineer, not a copy. The\ndivision may conduct follow-up inspections randomly to ensure that the\naffidavits accurately indicate the conditions of the premises. Any person or\nparty who submits a false statement will be subject to all penalties provided\nby law. (g) The amount\nof the reduction in rent ordered by the division pursuant to this section shall\nbe reduced by any credit, abatement or offset in rent which the tenant has\nreceived pursuant to section\n235-b\nof\nthe Real Property Law, that relates to one or more conditions covered by such\norder.
