  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 74.2 - Payment of tax on cigarettes possessed for sale; cigarette tax stamps\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 274, 471, 472, 475 and 476\n(a) The tax on cigarettes possessed for sale\nin the State is paid by the purchase of stamps as hereinafter provided and the\npayment of the tax is evidenced by the affixation of such stamps to individual\npackages of cigarettes. In the case of cigarettes possessed for sale in the\n\nCity of New York, both State and city taxes must be paid. This is done by\npurchasing and affixing joint stamps showing payment of both taxes. (b) (1)\n\nThe\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance is directed to, and periodically enters into\nand executes, for and on behalf of the State, contracts necessary for the\nmanufacture of cigarette tax stamps. Stamps manufactured are in such forms, denominations and quantities as the department deems necessary for the payment\nof the tax or taxes on the possession of cigarettes for sale imposed and/or\nadministered pursuant to the authority of article 20 of the Tax Law. The\ndepartment may, from time to time and as often as it deems advisable, provide\nfor the issuance and exclusive use of stamps of a new design and forbid the use\nof stamps of any other design. (2)\n(i) The department will furnish State of New\n\nYork cigarette stamps in $4.35 and $5.4375 denominations or the equivalent\nthereof. In addition, joint stamps of a distinctive color and design will be\nfurnished in $5.85 ($4.35 State tax plus $1.50 city tax per package of 20\ncigarettes) and $7.3175 ($5.4375 State tax plus $1.88 city tax per package of\n25 cigarettes) denominations, or the equivalent thereof, for use on packages of\ncigarettes to be sold in the City of New York. Such stamps will be of an\nadhesive and/or heat transfer nature. (Stamps will also reflect prepayment of\nsales tax on cigarettes imposed under section\n1103\nof the Tax Law.)\n(ii)\n\nAny manufacturer, dealer or agent who\nintends to sell within the State packages of cigarettes containing more than 25\ncigarettes, must notify the department, in writing, of such intention at least\n120 days prior to the time that such packages will be sold. Notification shall\nnot be required if the department has already prescribed, prepared and\nfurnished cigarette stamps of such form, denomination and quantity as may be\nnecessary for the proper payment of the cigarette taxes on such\npackages. (3)\n\nCigarette\nstamps so manufactured will be delivered or caused to be delivered to a fiscal\nagent or agent bank which is appointed or licensed by the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance for the purpose of making authorized sales of such stamps\nto licensed cigarette agents. No person, other than a duly appointed or\nlicensed fiscal agent or agent bank, may sell or offer for sale any cigarette\ntax stamps without the express written permission of the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance. Such a fiscal agent or agent bank shall be charged with\nthe lawful sale and distribution of cigarette stamps, the expeditious\nremittance of the cigarette tax revenue to the department and the performance\nof any and all acts pursuant to a written agreement entered into with the State\nwith respect to such services. (4)\n\nThe department may review the activities of a manufacturer of cigarette tax\nstamps, or of a fiscal agent or agent bank for purposes of verification of the\namount of any revenue due the State pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law\nand/or compliance with contractual agreements. (c) (1)\n\nLicensed cigarette agents, located within or without the State, may purchase\ncigarette tax stamps on either a cash or credit basis. Purchases must be placed\ndirectly with the fiscal agent or agent bank and must be effectuated in\naccordance with the terms and conditions prescribed in the written agreement\nentered into by the fiscal agent or agent bank with the State, which is in\neffect at the time of such purchases. (i) In\ngeneral, a licensed agent, upon establishing its authority to the fiscal agent\nor agent bank, may purchase stamps by telephone or by mail. In an emergency, an\nagent may purchase stamps in person (see subparagraph [iii] of this\nparagraph). (ii)\n(a) Payment in consideration for such stamps\nmust be made in cash, by guaranteed draft, by depository transfer or direct\nwire transfer of funds or by any other method acceptable to the fiscal agent or\nagent bank and approved by the department. (b) Additionally, a licensed cigarette agent\nmay, in the discretion of the department, be permitted to pay for such stamps\nwithin 30 days after the date of purchase, provided a credit bond or other\nacceptable security has been filed or deposited with the department pursuant to\n\nPart 71 of this Title. A fiscal agent or agent bank shall be notified, in\nwriting, by the department of the extent of an agent's credit privileges. In no\nevent shall credit for the purchase of cigarette stamps be granted in excess of\nthe amount of credit sanctioned by the department for such purpose. (iii)\n\nGenerally, delivery of\ncigarette tax stamps to a licensed agent will be made by the United States\n\nPostal Service via a classification of mail which guarantees next business day\ndelivery. Where an emergency necessitates that cigarette tax stamps be made\nimmediately available to the agent, arrangements may be made to allow the agent\nto otherwise receive such stamps. (2)\n\nAgents selling cigarettes in New York\n\nCity who desire to purchase joint State and city stamps must file with the\nfiscal agent or agent bank and the department, a copy of such agent's\ncertificate of authority to purchase and affix New York City cigarette tax\nstamps. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of article 20 of the Tax Law or this Title, the Department of Taxation and Finance may provide for the collection of the\ncigarette tax without the use of tax stamps. For example, the department may, in its discretion, provide that the payment of the cigarette tax be made\ndirectly to the department in advance of the distribution of sample cigarettes\nin the State. (e) See section 1814\nof article 37 of the Tax Law for criminal provisions applicable to false, altered or counterfeit stamps. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
