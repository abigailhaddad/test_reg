(1)\n\nSeptic tank capacities shall be based\nupon the number of household bedrooms. An expansion attic shall be considered\nas an additional bedroom. Table 3 specifies minimum septic tank capacities and\nminimum liquid surface areas. TABLE 3\nMINIMUM SEPTIC TANK CAPACITIES\nNumber of         Minimum Tank Capacity (gallons)  Minimum Liquid Surface Area\n\nBedrooms                                           (sq. ft.)\n1,2,3             1,000                            27\n4                 1,250                            34\n5                 1,500                            40\n6                 1,750                            47\nNOTE: Tank size requirements for more than six bedrooms shall\nbe calculated by adding 250 gallons and seven square feet of surface area for\neach additional bedroom. A garbage grinder shall be considered equivalent to an\nadditional bedroom for determining tank size. (2)\n\nSeptic tank covers shall always be\naccessible. Where manholes are more than 12 inches below final grade, an\nextension collar shall be provided over each opening. Extension collars shall\nnot be brought flush with the ground surface unless the cover can be locked to\nprevent tampering. Driveways or other facilities shall not be constructed above\nseptic tanks unless specially designed and reinforced to safely carry the load\nimposed. (b) Design and\n\nInstallation. (1)\n\nGeneral Requirements. The\nfollowing applies to all septic tanks regardless of material. (i) A minimum liquid depth of 30 inches. The\nmaximum depth for determining the allowable design volume of a tank shall be 60\ninches. Deeper tanks provide extra sludge storage, but no credit shall be given\ntoward design volume. (ii)\n\nThe\nminimum distance between the inlet and outlet shall be six feet. All tanks\nshall meet the minimum surface area requirement for the specific design volume\nspecified in Table 3. The effective length of rectangular tanks should not be\nless than two nor greater than four times the effective width. (iii)\n\nTanks must be watertight, constructed\nof durable material not subject to corrosion, decay, frost damage, or cracking. After installation, all septic tanks shall be able to support at least 300\npounds per square foot (psf). (iv)\n\nTanks with a liquid depth of 48 inches or more shall have a top opening with a\nminimum of 20 inches in the shortest dimension to allow entry into the tank. Tanks with a liquid depth less than 48 inches shall have a top opening that is\nat least 12 inches in the shortest dimension. (v) Tanks shall have inlet and outlet\nbaffles, sanitary tees or other devices to prevent the passage of floating\nsolids and to minimize disturbance of settled sludge and floating scum by\nsewage entering and leaving the tank. Outlet designs such as gas deflection\nbaffles are strongly recommended in all tanks. Inlet and outlet baffles shall\nextend a minimum of 12 inches and 14 inches respectively, below the liquid\nlevel in tanks with a liquid depth of less than 40 inches, and 16 and 18 inches\nrespectively, in tanks with a liquid depth of 40 inches or greater. The\ndistance between the outlet baffle and the outlet shall not exceed six inches. Baffles shall be constructed of a durable material not subject to corrosion, decay or cracking. (vi)\n\nThere shall\nbe a minimum of one inch clearance between the underside of the top of the tank\nand the top of all baffles, partition and/or tees to permit venting of tank\ngases. Multi-chamber and multi-tank systems shall also be designed to permit\nthe venting of tank gases. (vii)\n\nTanks shall be placed on at least a three inch bed of sand or pea gravel. This\nwill provide for proper leveling and bearing. Additional instructions provided\nby the manufacturer shall also be followed. (viii)\n\nThere shall be a minimum drop in\nelevation of two inches between the inverts of the inlet and outlet\npipes. (ix)\n\nGarbage grinders. An\nadditional 250 gallons of capacity and seven square feet of surface area is\nrequired when a garbage grinder can reasonably be expected at the time of\nconstruction or in the future. A gas deflection baffle or other acceptable\noutlet modification, and a dual compartment tank or two tanks in series must\nalso be provided. (2)\n\nMulti-compartment tanks or tanks in series. (i) Dual compartments are recommended for all\ntanks and shall be required on all tanks with an interior length of ten feet or\nmore. (ii)\n\nThe first compartment or\ntank (inlet side) shall account for 60 - 75% of the required total design\nvolume. (iii)\n\nThe baffle separating\nthe compartments shall extend from the bottom of the tank to at least six\ninches above the invert of the outlet pipe. (iv)\n\nCompartments shall be connected by a\nfour inch vertical slot at least 18 inches in width, a six inch elbow, or two\nfour-inch elbows located at a distance below the liquid level equal to\none-third the distance between the invert of the outlet and the bottom of the\ntank. At least one access manhole shall be provided into each\ncompartment. (v) Tanks in series\nshould be connected by a single pipe with a minimum diameter of four\ninches. (vi)\n\nThe volume and surface\narea for meeting the requirements of Table 3 shall be based upon the total\nvolume and surface areas of all the tanks and chambers. (3)\n\nConcrete tanks. (i) Concrete shall have a minimum compressive\nstrength of 2,500 pounds per square inch (psi) at 28 days set; 3,000 psi\nconcrete is recommended as a minimum. (ii)\n\nWall thickness shall be a minimum of\nthree inches unless the design has been certified by a New York licensed\nprofessional engineer as complying with all appropriate requirements for\nthin-wall construction. All walls, bottom and top shall contain reinforcing to\nassure support for 300 psi. (iii)\n\nAll joints small be sealed such that the tank is watertight; joints below the\nliquid level must be tested for watertightness prior to backfilling. (iv)\n\nThe walls and floor of cast-in-place\ntanks shall be poured at the same time (monolithic pour). (4)\n\nFiberglass and polyethylene tanks. These\ntanks must meet the following additional requirements: (i) These tanks shall not be installed in\nareas where the groundwater level can rise to the level of the bottom of the\nseptic tank. (ii)\n\nParticular care\nmust be taken during installation, bedding, and backfilling of these units so\nas to prevent damage to tank walls. The manufacturer's installation\ninstructions shall be followed. (iii)\n\nAll tanks should be sold by the\nmanufacturer completely assembled. If, because of size, the tank is delivered\nto the site in sections, all joints shall be sealed with watertight gaskets and\nshall be tested for watertightness after installation, and prior to\nbackfilling. (5)\n\nSteel\ntanks. Steel tanks must have a label indicating corrosion protection complying\nwith Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., Standard UL-70 or equivalent. (6)\n\nEnhanced Treatment Units (ETU). (i) General. ETUs shall have a label\nindicating compliance with the standards for a Class I unit as described in the\n\nNational Sanitation Foundation (NSF) International Standard 40 or equivalent\ntesting. (ii)\n\nDesign Criteria. (a) The minimum rated daily capacity of these\nunits shall be 400 gallons or the daily design flow as determined from Table 1, whichever is greater. (b) ETUs\nshall have an effluent filtering mechanism as part of the manufactured product\nor an effluent filter with a label indicating compliance with NSF Standard 46\nor equivalent installed on the system outlet prior to discharge to the\nabsorption area. (c) Unless\notherwise specified, the absorption system that follows an ETU shall be\ndesigned in the same manner as it would for septic tank effluent. (d) Absorption areas receiving ETU effluent\nmay be designed with a 33 percent reduction in the total absorption trench\nlength listed in Table 4A or as calculated from Table 4B, when one of the\nfollowing situations exist: (1)\nETUs are\nsubject to the jurisdiction of a Responsible Management Entity (RME); or\n(2)\n\nLocal sanitary codes or\nwatershed rules or regulations incorporate the requirement to maintain and\nservice the ETU in accordance with the manufacturer's\nrecommendations. (e) The\ntrench length reduction may only be used for conventional absorption trench\nsystems and shallow absorption trench systems. (f) The trench length reduction may not be\nfurther reduced by the trench length reduction allowed for gravelless systems\nas described in paragraph 75- A.8(c)(3). (g) The trench length reduction specified\nabove in clause 75-A.6(b)(6)(ii)(d) is not applicable at properties located\nwithin the New York City Watershed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
