  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 145-1.2 - Procedures for obtaining records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe records access officer shall be the\ncustodian of the records of the division. Any person wishing to inspect and/or\nobtain a copy of any record, may make application to the records access\nofficer. Applications shall be oral, or in writing on a form to be prescribed\nby the records access officer. Blank forms may be obtained from the records\naccess officer either personally on any workday in Room 113 of the State\n\nCapitol in Albany, or by mail, addressed to that office, as the records access\nofficer may specify on the application form. Upon receipt of a request, the\nrecords access officer shall search for the record requested. If the records\naccess officer determines that the record requested is not in his custody, the\nrecords access officer shall advise the applicant, as the case may be: (i) that the record requested is not in his\ncustody; (ii)\nthat the record does\nnot exist; (iii)\nthat the record is\nin the custody of another specified agency; or\n(iv)\nthat the records of which the agency is\na custodian cannot be found after a diligent search. If the records access officer determines that the record\nrequested is in his custody, the records access officer shall either produce\nthe record for inspection at his office (and, if so requested and upon payment\nof the appropriate fee, shall make and certify a copy of the record), or advise\nthe applicant, in writing, as provided in section\n145-1.6\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nIn view of the time\nrequired to conduct record searches, locate and forward certain record\ninformation, the division reserves the right to respond to inquiries within\nfive workdays of receiving the request. Every effort will be made, however, to\nrespond to each request as soon as possible. If for any reason additional time\nis required to produce records, the records access officer shall acknowledge\nreceipt of the request within five working days of such receipt, explain the\nreason for the delay, and provide an estimate of the date on which a completed\nresponse will be forthcoming. The acknowledgment will also notify the\nrequesting party that failure by the division to grant access to the requested\nrecord within 10 working days may, by law, be construed as a denial of access\nand may be appealed. (3)\n\nThe\nrecords access officer may at his discretion waive any formality prescribed by\nthis subdivision, including the use of prescribed application forms. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n145-1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
