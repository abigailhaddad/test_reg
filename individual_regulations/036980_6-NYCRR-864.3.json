  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 864.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I of this Part an item number is assigned to\neach specifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I of this Part shall mean that number or abbreviation which\nhas been assigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for\nthe purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe\nnumbering or index system used to identify specific waters of New York State\nwas adapted from that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey series of reports on the watersheds of the State. The primary\nwaters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred\nto by name or an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively\nnumbered progressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered\nconsecutively as they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the\nletter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as\nthey enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or\nmouth. When isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey of the Lower Hudson watershed in 1936, and has been closely\nfollowed in connection with the identification of the waters with the following\nexceptions: some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the\nomission of streams originally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation\n\nDepartment at the time of its 1936 survey, but not shown on newer maps\nreproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but\nappearing on the newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to\nthe identification of waters in the Lower Hudson River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\nH\nHudson River\n\nPrimary waters within New York State extending\nupstream from The Battery, New York City. H-43\n\nLake Tiorati Brook\n\nThe forty-third tributary of the Hudson River in\n\nNew York State above The Battery (Map Q-24nw). H-43-1\n\nMinisceongo Creek\n\nThe first tributary entering Lake Tiorati Brook\nupstream from its mouth (Map Q-24nw). H-43-1-11-P 150c\n\nLake Welch\n\nOne of several ponds or lakes encountered between\nthe 150th and 151st pond of the waters index system, and specifically located\nin the drainage basin of the 11th tributary of Minisceongo Creek upstream from\nits mouth (Map Q-23ne). (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall\nmean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any\nother stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries\nor subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall\ninclude only the stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water referenced\nby such waters index number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned\nafter the waters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include\nthe stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water referenced by such\nwaters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are\nshown on the reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I of this Part shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically\ndesignated waters are generally known and which may appear on the reference\nmaps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named\ntributary to which the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I of this Part shall mean a\nbrief indication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I of this Part, means map reference number\nand indicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein\ncompletely, or in part, on which the specifically designated waters and their\nindex numbers are shown. The following maps were produced from original maps\nwhich may be procured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological\n\nSurvey. Map ref. no.
