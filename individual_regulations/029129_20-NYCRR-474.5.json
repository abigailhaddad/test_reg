  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 474.5 - Transfer of permit and plate or sticker\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 502\n(a) A permit and plate or sticker issued for\na particular motor vehicle to a carrier may not be transferred to any other\nmotor vehicle whether owned by the carrier or by any other person. A permit and\nplate or sticker issued to a carrier for a particular motor vehicle may not be\ntransferred to any other carrier or entity although the latter operates the\nsame motor vehicle. However, a lessee for a period of 30 days or less is not\nrequired to obtain a permit (see section\n473.8\nof this\n\nTitle) but may operate a motor vehicle under the permit and plate or sticker\nissued to the owner thereof. If the owner to whom a permit and plate or sticker\nwere issued sells the motor vehicle or leases it under an agreement covering a\nperiod of more than 30 consecutive days, a new permit and plate or sticker must\nbe obtained by the new owner or the lessee. A permit and plate or sticker\nissued to a lessee are valid only during the term of the lease or an extension\nthereof. Any subsequent leasing of the motor vehicle to another lessee under an\nagreement covering a period of more than 30 consecutive days requires a new\npermit and plate or sticker. Example 1: A, the owner of a motor vehicle, has obtained a permit. If A sells the motor vehicle to B, B must obtain a new permit. Example 2: C, the owner of a motor vehicle, has obtained a permit. If C leases the motor vehicle to D for a period of one year, under the terms of\na lease or agreement granting D direct control thereof, D must obtain a new\npermit. Example 3: E, the owner of the motor vehicle, has obtained a permit. If E leases the motor vehicle to F for one week and to G for 10 days, neither F\nnor G is required to obtain a permit but may operate the motor vehicle under\nE's permit. Example 4: H leases a motor vehicle from J for six months. H obtains\na permit therefor. If J at the termination of the lease, leases it to K for one\nyear, K must obtain a new permit. Example 5: L leases a motor vehicle from M for six months. L obtains\na permit therefor, and returns the motor vehicle to M at the termination of the\nlease. M must obtain a new permit if he had not obtained a permit prior to the\nexecution of the lease. Example 6: N leases a motor vehicle from O for six months and N\nobtains a permit therefor. If the lease is renewed for a further six months, N\nis not required to obtain a new permit. Example 7: P has a permit for a motor vehicle and interchanges it\nwith Q. Q need not obtain a new permit but may operate the motor vehicle under\nthe permit issued to P. (b) If a corporation transfers a motor vehicle to a subsidiary or affiliated\ncorporation, a new permit and plate or sticker must be obtained by the\nsubsidiary or affiliated corporation. However, if the motor vehicle is\ntransferred by the corporation to a branch, division or plant of the same\ncorporation, no new permit is required. If a business is dissolved, and\nreorganized in another form, the new organization is required to obtain a new\npermit and plate or sticker for the motor vehicle. Example: A corporation has a permit for a motor vehicle. The\ncorporation is dissolved and partnership B is formed to operate the business. B\nmust obtain a new permit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
