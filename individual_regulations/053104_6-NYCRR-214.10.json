Tit. 6 § 214.10 - Exceptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon written\napplication by a source owner to the office which issues the certificate to\noperate for that source, the commissioner may apply less stringent emission\nstandards than required by this Part for any existing by-product coke oven\nbattery, if the source owner demonstrates: (1)\nthat the less stringent emission standards will not result in or contribute to\nthe violation of any ambient air quality standard; (2)\nthe required costs of controls are\nunreasonable because of plant age, location or process design; (3)\nthe physical impossibility of installing\nnecessary emission control equipment; or\n(4)\nother factors specific to the emission\nsource that make application of the standard unreasonable. (b) A source owner required to comply with\nthe coke pushing and transport emission control requirements specified in\nsection\n214.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart may be exempted from such requirements upon the acceptance by the\ncommissioner of an alternative emission reduction plan submitted to the office\nwhich issues the certificate to operate for that source by the source owner. The plan shall become effective upon approval by the Environmental Protection\n\nAgency. In order for such a plan to be acceptable, the following requirements\nmust be met: (1)\na complete emission\ninventory for all coke-making sources must be included in the alternative\nemission reduction plan which show no net increase in coking emissions; and\n(2)\nair quality dispersion\nmodeling must show that the submitted coke-making inventory, when modeled in\nplace of the plant's coke-making emission inventory in the State implementation\nplan, will show attainment of the air quality standards off-plant\nproperty. (c) Any source\nowner subject to the opacity requirements of section\n214.4\n(b) or\n214.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart may apply in writing to the office which issues the certificate to operate\nfor that source and will be granted an equivalent opacity if either of the\nfollowing conditions are met: (1)\nif the\nsource owner can demonstrate through tests done in compliance with Part 202 of\nthis Title that the source is in compliance with all applicable emission\nrequirements other than the opacity standard and that the source and any\nassociated emission control is being operated and maintained in a manner to\nminimize the generation of visible emissions; or\n(2)\nthe source owner has obtained approval\nfor an alternative emission reduction plan under subdivision (a) or (b) of this\nsection which covers the source for which equivalent opacity is\ndesired. (d) Any\nexception granted under this section must be incorporated in an enforceable\nlegally binding agreement between the source owner and the\ndepartment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n214.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
