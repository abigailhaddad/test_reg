State Regulations
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), and
subdivision (c) hereunder, the book cost of depreciable operating property
retired (see §
196.1, subd. [a][35]) shall be
charged in its entirety to account 261, Depreciation Reserves, together with
the cost of removal. To that account shall be credited salvage value and
amounts recovered as insurance or otherwise, including amounts provided in
account 264, Insurance Reserve. (b) For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for the replacement
of small items of property, depreciable Operating Property-- Electric and

Operating Property--General shall be grouped into (1) units of property, and
(2) minor items, and the accounting for retirements and replacements of each
group shall be as follows: (1)

Units of
property. Not later than six months following the date when it becomes subject
to this system of accounts, each utility shall file with the commission a
statement subscribed by the responsible municipal official or other duly
authorized representative showing for each account or subdivision thereof in

Operating Property--Electric (and Operating Property--General) a list of the
types and quantities of property which are accounted for as units of property. Any revision thereof shall be filed in like manner. The book cost of any unit
of property retired shall be credited to the appropriate operating property
account and charged to account 261, Depreciation Reserves, whether or not
replaced. The cost of property installed in place of property retired shall be
charged to the appropriate operating property account. (2)

Minor items. (i) This group includes any part or element
which is not designated as a unit of property. The book cost of any minor item
of property retired and not replaced shall be credited to the operating
property account wherein included and charged to account 261, Depreciation

Reserves, except that, if the book cost of a minor item of property has been or
will be accounted for by its inclusion in the unit of property of which it is a
part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the operating property
account is required when such minor item is retired. (ii)

If minor items of property are retired
and replaced (apart from the unit of property of which they form a part or with
which they are associated), no entry shall be made in the operating property
account or in account 261, Depreciation Reserves. The cost of the replacement
shall be charged to the account appropriate for the cost of repairs to the
property, except that, if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the
primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more
efficient, or of greater capacity), there shall be charged to the appropriate
operating property account the access cost of the replacement over the
estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment the minor
items retired. (c) Determination of book cost. The book cost
of operating property retired shall be the amount at which such property is
included in the operating property accounts including all items set forth in
paragraphs (1) to (10) of subdivision (e) of section
197.21. Such costs shall be
determined from the utility's records when this can be done, as in the case of
land, structures, boilers, engines, generating station and substation
equipment, transportation, office, and other equipment, and other items of
operating property for which individual cost records are available. When the
actual book cost can not be determined from the records, it shall be estimated. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each item due to the
relatively large number or small cost thereof, the average book cost of the
items, with due allowance for differences in size, character or year of
installation, shall be used as the book cost of the items retired, except that
utilities in Classes C and D need not take account of year of installation. The
continuing property record, when completed, shall be used in accounting for
retirements. (d) The accounting for
the retirement of items included in account 302, Franchises and Consents, account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Property, and intangible elements with
limited terms included in account 311, Land, shall be as provided in the texts
of account 262, Amortization Reserves, and account 790, Amortization of

Intangible Property. (e) When
operating property constituting an operating unit or system is sold, the book
cost of the property shall be credited to the appropriate operating property
accounts. The amounts (estimated if not known) carried with respect thereto in
the depreciation and amortization reserve accounts and account 263, Contributions for Extensions, shall be cleared for such reserves. Unless
otherwise ordered by the commission, the difference, if any, between (1) the
net amount of such debit and credit items, and (2) the consideration received
for the property, shall be included, if a debit, in account 514, Miscellaneous

Debits to Surplus, or, if a credit, in account 502, Miscellaneous Credits to

Surplus. (f) If the cause of
retirement of depreciable Operating Property--Electric or Operating

Property--General is one for which provision has not been made in the
depreciation reserves and the loss is not covered by insurance, or if the
retirement could not reasonably have been foreseen and provided for, the
utility, upon order of the commission, may credit account 261, Depreciation

Reserves, and charge account 143, Suspense to be Amortized, with the unprovided
for loss in service value and distribute it through charges to account 789, Deferred Retirement Losses, over such period as the commission may
order. Notes

State Regulations
(a) Each
ambulance company for which a service award program is adopted shall maintain
at all times for each volunteer ambulance worker of the company, whether or not
a participant in the program, a record of the activities performed and points
granted toward a year of ambulance service credit. (b) On or before March 31st of each year, each ambulance company for which a service award program is adopted shall
prepare and submit to the governing board of the sponsor a list of all the
volunteer ambulance workers of the company which identifies all those who have
earned credit for a year of ambulance service during the preceding calendar
year. Such list shall be certified under oath by the president, secretary and
chief or comparable officers of the ambulance company and shall be accompanied
by such membership records or records of point accumulations as the governing
board may require to substantiate the accuracy of the list. Such list shall
also identify those volunteer ambulance workers who have waived participation
in the service award program as provided in subdivision (g) of this
section. (c) On or before May 1st
of each year, the governing board of the sponsor shall review each such
certified list and may delete the name of any person who was not a volunteer
ambulance worker during the proceeding calendar year or disallow the service
credit of any volunteer ambulance worker who did not earn 50 points during the
proceeding calendar year or whose point accumulation has not been adequately
documented. Thereafter, the governing board shall approve each such certified
list of volunteer ambulance workers and each volunteer ambulance worker thereon
identified as having earned 50 or more points during the preceding calendar
year shall be credited with a year of ambulance service. Upon approval, the
governing board shall cause a copy of each list to be returned the appropriate
ambulance company and each ambulance company shall, immediately upon receipt, post the list in a conspicuous place at its principal headquarters for at least
30 days and maintain a record of the date on which the list is
posted. (d) Not later than 30 days
after the approved list is posted by the ambulance company, any volunteer
ambulance worker whose name does not appear on the list as having earned credit
for a year of ambulance service may appeal to the governing board of the
sponsor to have his or her name added to the list as having earned credit for a
year of ambulance service. The appeal shall be in writing and mailed to the
clerk or secretary of the governing board of the sponsor. The governing board
shall investigate all appeals and upon finding that such a volunteer ambulance
worker has earned a year of ambulance service credit for the preceding calendar
year, shall order the volunteer ambulance worker to be identified as having
earned a year of ambulance service credit on the approved list. (e) On or before July 1st of each year, the
governing board of the sponsor shall cause a certified copy of the approved
list to be filed with the administrator accompanied by appropriate
documentation supporting any changes to the list made pursuant to subdivision
(d) of this section. (f) The
administrator shall retain such list and shall promptly forward a copy of such
list to the program actuary. (g) Any volunteer ambulance worker not wishing to participate in the service award
program may waive participation by filing with the chief executive officer of
the ambulance company, the chief executive officer of the political subdivision
and the administrator a written notice of waiver of participation. Such waiver
shall remain effective until withdrawn in the same manner. During the period
such a waiver remains effective, a volunteer ambulance worker shall not earn
service credit, nor be entitled to a distribution from the program. (h) If the effective date as of which a
volunteer ambulance worker (or the volunteer ambulance worker's beneficiary, if
the volunteer ambulance worker is deceased) begins to be paid a service award
is other than the last day of a calendar year, the volunteer ambulance worker
shall have the opportunity to earn service credit (i.e., points under the point
system) up to the day immediately preceding the effective date as of which the
service award payments commence. When preparing this list described in
subdivision (b) of this section, only activities performed by a volunteer
ambulance worker up to the day immediately preceding the effective date as of
which service award payments commenced to the volunteer shall be considered
when determining whether the volunteer earned 50 points during the calendar
year in which the service award payments commenced to the volunteer. One year
of service credit shall be awarded to a volunteer ambulance worker only if he
or she earned 50 points for activities he or she performed up to the day
immediately preceding the effective date as of which the service award payments
commenced to the volunteer. When determining the points to be awarded to the
volunteer ambulance worker for participation in ambulance company responses up
to such day, the volunteer ambulance worker must have responded to the same
minimum number of calls for the year that all other volunteer ambulance workers
may be required to respond to under the point system adopted by the sponsor. Upon receipt of a certified copy of the approved list by the administrator as
set forth in subdivision (e) of this section, the administrator shall promptly
direct the program trustee to begin paying the volunteer ambulance worker any
additional service award to which he or she may be entitled to be paid as of
the effective date on which service award payments commenced to the volunteer
ambulance worker. Notes

inventory is to be signed by the eligible person and is to be supplied to all
estimators and bidders for each phase of the work, and they are to base their
estimates and bids on removal of the items listed therein. The occupant may, at
his own expense, obtain competitive bids on the costs of moving and may submit
a competitive self-move bid on all or a portion of the removal. (b) Actual costs must be documented upon
receipted, detailed bills from recognized movers, skilled craftsman, and are
not to exceed the total of the lowest acceptable bids or estimates obtained on
each phase of the move. (c) Estimates and bids on each phase of the move shall be obtained by the office
from generally recognized, qualified movers and skilled craftsmen. Upon receipt
and review of all estimates and bids, the office will determine the lowest
acceptable bid. This bid will be sent to the eligible person, advising him to
commence moving and setting forth the limits of reimbursement and the time and
manner in which payment will be made. After the removal has been accomplished, actual costs must be documented by detailed, receipted bills from recognized
movers, skilled craftsmen, and are not to exceed the approved amount based on a
total of the lowest acceptable bids or estimates obtained on each phase of the
move. All bids from movers and craftsmen must be submitted in accordance with
section
463.6
of this Part. (d) In the case of a
self-move, the owner of a relocated business may be paid an amount, to be
negotiated between the State and the business, not to exceed the lower of two
firm bids or estimates obtained by the State from qualified moving
firms. (e) When personal property
which is used in connection with the business to be moved is of low value and
high bulk and the estimated cost of moving would be disproportionate in
relation to the value, the State may negotiate with the owner for an amount not
to exceed the difference between the cost of replacement of comparable item(s)
on the market and the amount which would probably have been received for the
item(s) on liquidation. (f) All
books and records kept by eligible persons shall be subject to review and audit
by a State representative during reasonable business hours. (g) Payment of moving expenses is based upon
the preapproval of estimates and bids submitted to the office before commencing
the move. If, due to extraordinary circumstances, a move is completed without
submitting necessary bids, the commissioner may, upon receipt of sufficient
written justification for failure to submit estimates, pay reasonable and
necessary actual expenses upon verification and support for the expenses
incurred. Notes

State Regulations

Applies to charges for violation of the rules prescribed
by or referred to in this Part heretofore served which have not been finally
determined within 60 days after the adoption hereof, which charges shall be
referred to the committee constituted pursuant to said section
535.9
for determination in
accordance therewith, and said section shall apply to all charges for violation
of such rules hereafter made, whether for violations heretofore or hereafter
committed. [Education Law, §355(2)(b) ]Education Law, §355(2)(b)
(a) The term chief administrative officer, as
used in these rules, shall be deemed to mean and include any person authorized
to exercise the powers of that office during a vacancy therein or during the
absence or disability of the incumbent and for purposes of this section shall
also include any designee appointed by said officer. (b) Whenever a complaint is made to the chief
administrative officer of any State-operated institution of the university of a
violation by a student or students of the rules prescribed in this Part (or of
any rules adopted by an individual institution supplementing or implementing
such rules) or whenever he has knowledge that such a violation may have
occurred, he shall cause an investigation to be made and the statements of the
complainants, if any, and of other persons having knowledge of the facts
reduced to writing. If he is satisfied from such investigation and statements
that there is reasonable ground to believe that there has been such a
violation, he shall prepare or cause to be prepared charges against the student
or students alleged to have committed such violation which shall state the
provision prescribing the offense and shall specify the ultimate facts alleged
to constitute such offense. (c) Such charges shall be in writing and shall be served on the student or students
named therein by delivering the same to him or them personally, if possible, or, if not, by mailing a copy of such charges by registered mail to such
student or students at his or their usual place or places of abode while
attending college and also to his or their home address or addresses, if
different. (d) The notice of
charges so served shall fix a date for hearing thereon not less than 10 or more
than 15 days from the date of service which shall be the date of mailing where
necessary to effect service by mail. Failure to appear in response to the
charges on the date fixed for hearing, unless there has been a continuance for
good cause shown, shall be deemed to be an admission of the facts stated in
such charges and shall warrant such action as may then be appropriate thereon. Before taking such action the hearing committee, hereinafter referred to, shall
give notice to any student, who has failed to appear, in the manner prescribed
in subdivision (c), of its proposed findings and recommendations to be
submitted to the chief administrative officer and shall so submit such findings
and recommendations 10 days thereafter unless the student has meanwhile shown
good cause for his failure to appear, in which case a date for hearing shall be
fixed. (e) Upon demand at any time
before or at the hearing, the student charged or his representative, duly
designated, shall be furnished a copy of the statements taken by the chief
administrative officer in relation to such charges and with the names of any
other witnesses who will be produced at the hearing in support of the charges; provided, however, that this shall not preclude the testimony of witnesses who
were unknown at the time of such demand. (f) The chief administrative officer may, upon the service of charges, suspend the student named therein, from all or any
part of the institution's premises or facilities, pending the hearing and
determination thereof, whenever, in his judgment, the continued presence of
such student would constitute a clear danger to himself or to the safety of
persons or property on the premises of the institution or would pose an
immediate threat of disruptive interference with the normal conduct of the
institution's activities and functions; provided, however, that the chief
administrative officer shall grant an immediate hearing on request of any
student so suspended with respect to the basis for such suspension. (g) There shall be constituted at each

State-operated institution a hearing committee to hear charges against students
of violation of the rules for maintenance of public order prescribed by or
referred to in this Part. Such committee shall consist of three members of the
administrative staff and three members of the faculty, designated by the chief
administrative officer, and three students who shall be designated by the
members named by the chief administrative officer. Each such member shall serve
until his successor or replacement has been designated. No member of the
committee shall serve in any case where he is witness or is or has been
directly involved in the events upon which the charges are based. In order to
provide for cases where there may be such a disqualification and for cases of
absence or disability, the chief administrative officer shall designate an
alternate member of the administrative staff and an alternate member of the
faculty, and his principal designees shall designate an alternate student
member, to serve in such cases. Any five members of the committee may conduct
hearings and make findings and recommendations as hereinafter provided. At any
institution where the chief administrative officer determines that the number
of hearings which will be required to be held is, or may be, so great that they
cannot otherwise be disposed of with reasonable speed, he may determine that
the hearing committee shall consist of six members of the administrative staff
and six members of the faculty to be designated by him and of six students who
shall be designated by the members so designated by him. In such event the
chief administrative officer shall designate one of such members as chairman
who may divide the membership of the committee into three divisions each to
consist of two members of the administrative staff, two faculty members and two
students and may assign charges among such divisions for hearing. Any four
members of each such division may conduct hearings and make recommendations as
hereinafter provided. (h) The
hearing committee shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence but may
hear or receive any testimony or evidence which is relevant and material to the
issues presented by the charges and which will contribute to a full and fair
consideration thereof and determination thereon. A student against whom the
charges are made may appear by and with representatives of his choice. He may
confront and examine witnesses against him and may produce witnesses and
documentary evidence in his own behalf. There may be present at the hearing: the student charged and his representatives and witnesses; other witnesses; representatives of the institutional administration; and, unless the student
shall request a closed hearing, such other members of the institutional
community or other persons, or both, as may be admitted by the hearing
committee. A transcript of the proceedings shall be made. (i) Within 20 days after the close of a
hearing, the hearing committee shall submit a report of its findings of fact
and recommendations for disposition of the charges to the chief administrative
officer, together with a transcript of the proceedings, and shall at the same
time transmit a copy of its report to the student concerned or his
representative. Within 10 days thereafter the chief administrative officer
shall make his determination thereon. Final authority to dismiss the charges or
to determine the guilt of those against whom they are made and to expel, suspend or otherwise discipline them shall be vested in the chief
administrative officer. If he shall reject the findings of the hearing
committee in whole or in part, he shall make new findings which must be based
on substantial evidence in the record and shall include them in the notice of
his final determination which shall be served upon the student or students with
respect to whom it is made. [FN*] Applies to charges for violation of the rules
prescribed by or referred to in this Part heretofore served which have not been
finally determined within 60 days after the adoption hereof, which charges
shall be referred to the committee constituted pursuant to said section
535.9

accordance therewith, and said section shall apply to all charges for violation
of such rules hereafter made, whether for violations heretofore or hereafter
committed. Notes

State Regulations
(a) This section
implements section
1000
of the Retirement and Social Security

Law providing for retirement credit for military service rendered by members
and eligible retired members during periods of military conflict. (b) No claim for retirement credit under
section 1000 shall be deemed filed with the system until the member or retiree
of the system has filed a form DD-214 or equivalent documentation with respect
to the military service being claimed. However, a member or retiree shall be
deemed to have filed a claim for retirement credit as of the effective date of
section 1000 if such member or retiree has on file with the system on the
effective date of section 1000 a form DD-214 or equivalent documentation which
covers the military service for which retirement credit may be granted under
section 1000. (c) For purposes of
determining the cost to be paid by the eligible member for such credit, the
member's compensation earned during the twelve months of credited service
immediately preceding the date that the member made application for credit
shall be the compensation earned by the member during the plan year or plan
years during which the member most recently earned one year of credited
service, beginning with the plan year (July 1-June 30) last ending immediately
prior to the date on which the member filed his/her application for military
service credit and working backwards from the end of such plan year. In the
case of a retiree eligible to obtain military credit under section 1000, the 12
month period immediately preceding retirement shall be the period during which
the member last accrued one year of credited service beginning from the plan
year last ending immediately prior to the member's date of retirement and
working backwards from the end of such plan year. Compensation for the purposes
of section 1000 shall be salary earned as defined in section
5001.1
(f) of this

Part. (d) An eligible member or
retiree shall pay the cost of retirement credit no later than the end of the
plan year following the plan year in which the system bills the member for such
cost. Otherwise, the application for retirement credit shall be deemed to have
been abandoned and such member or retiree must file a new application to the
system in order to obtain credit for such service. (e) In the event a member is not able to
benefit from any retirement credit purchased pursuant to section 1000, the cost
for such credit shall be refunded to such member at retirement or death with
interest at the rate of five percent per annum. Notes

planning process. (k) Access to personal allowance. (1)

Present allowance funds shall be made
readily accessible to the person. (2)

suspected misappropriation or wrongful withholding of personal allowance funds
and may commence and/or maintain an action an behalf of any individual or group
of individuals to recover any funds so lost, misappropriated or
withheld. (2)

agency or sponsoring agency is suspected of losing, misappropriating, or
wrongfully withholding an individual's personal allowance, OPWDD or its
designee may investigate and where appropriate, take the steps necessary to
recover or secure release of resident funds. Funds recovered in this manner
shall be given to the respective individual or credited to his/her personal
allowance account at the earliest possible date. (3)

this section. (n) Transfer of funds. This subdivision is superseded by subdivision
633.9
(f) of this

Part, effective October 1, 2017. (1)

When an
individual is moving to another living situation, the balance of all personal
allowance managed by the agency or sponsoring agency shall be forwarded to the
officially designated party for the new residential setting within 10 business
days of the person's departure. This includes the money in the personal
allowance account, including any personal allowance in cash at the residential
site, and all money in a burial reserve account. However, if the person's
monies (personal allowance, accrued personal allowance, countable income or
NAMI, and conserved countable income) were derived, in total or in part, from
payments made by the Social Security Administration (SSA), and the chief
executive officer is the representative payee, the following procedures apply: (i) If the person is moving to a facility
operated or sponsored by the same agency, the agency shall retain all monies
and the chief executive officer of the agency shall continue to serve as the
person's representative payee. Personal allowance monies maintained in cash at
the residential site shall be forwarded to the new residential
facility. (ii)

In all other cases, the monies derived from payments made by SSA must either be returned to SSA
within 10 business days of the person's departure or, if specifically permitted
by SSA, forwarded to the new representative payee. Any encumbered funds shall
be retained by the agency and appropriately disbursed. Monies derived from
other sources shall be forwarded to the officially designated party for the new
residential setting within 10 business days of the person's departure. If
monies derived from SSA have been combined with monies from other sources, then
the amount returned to SSA shall be the percentage of the current total which
represents the SSA portion. The percentage shall be calculated based on the
historical portions received over the last six months of monies from SSA and
non-SSA sources. (a) The original agency shall
notify the new agency regarding the return of the person's monies to SSA at the
time of such return or transfer of monies. (b) If the person is moving to another
residence certified or operated by OPWDD: (1)
on or before the date of the move, the original agency shall disburse a sum
equivalent to one month's minimum statutory allowance or the total of the
person's monies, whichever is less, prior to returning to SSA the remainder (if
any) of the person's monies that were derived from payments made by
SSA; (2)
the chief executive
officer of the new agency shall apply to SSA to become the person's
representative payee no later than three business days after the person's
admission; (3)
upon the appointment
of the chief executive officer of the new agency as representative payee by SSA
and receipt of the person's accrued monies, the new agency shall consider the
monies to be accrued personal allowance, except for any amount which is due and
payable to the new agency for the provider payment(s) derived from the SSA
payment at the time of the receipt of monies; and
(4)
the new agency shall monitor the person's
resources. (c) All funds
in a burial reserve account, annotated as such, regardless of the origin of the
funds, shall be forwarded to the officially designated party for the new
residential setting within 10 business days of departure. (2)

Except for monies received
from SSA, when the chief executive officer of the original agency is the payee, the ongoing monthly personal allowance shall be forwarded within five business
days of receipt of the benefit check to the new living situation. This
arrangement shall continue until a new pave is designated. (o) Record retention. Each agency or sponsoring agency shall maintain complete
records documenting all transactions involving personal allowance for four
years. (p) Prohibitions. An agency or a sponsoring agency shall not: (1)
withhold personal allowance for any
reason, or use personal allowance to reward or punish a person; (2)
charge a fee to anyone to manage the
resident's personal allowance; (3)
borrow from, or pledge, any personal allowance; (4)
demand, require, beneficially receive, or
contract for all or any part of anyone's personal allowance to pay for expenses
or supplies and services which the agency is mandated to provide in accordance
with Subpart 635-9 of this Title. In no case shall personal allowance be used
to: (i) compensate agency staff, sponsoring
agency staff, or family care providers for services rendered at any time; or
(ii)
pay any expenses of agency
staff, sponsoring agency staff, or family care providers for activities or
transportation while providing mandated services; or
(iii)
pay for any medical/dental/clinical
supplies and services not paid by Medicaid/Medicare/private insurance unless
excess resources are available; or
(iv)
purchase any item or service for which
public funds, including local, State or Federal funds, are provided, or for
which reimbursement is made through a rate, fee, price, or grant-in-aid, or any
goods or services which are paid for or reimbursed through public or private
insurance. This includes educational services mandated for children by the

Education Law; or
(v) make
restitution for damages caused by that person unless, as documented in the
person's plan of services: (a) the agency has
addressed the person's inappropriate behavior; (b) the expenditure planning team has
determined that financial restitution is appropriate and has meaning for the
person; (c) the payee (if other
than the agency chief executive officer [CEO]), has provided written approval
for the use of a portion of the personal allowance for such purpose; and
(d) a committee, or part of the
committee, charged with protecting the rights of persons in the facility, has
approved the time limited use of that person's personal allowance for such
purposes. (q) Purchases. (1)

Purchases made with personal allowance
are the personal property of the individual. (2)

Personal allowance may be used to make a
group purchase in accordance with requirements of the Social Security

Administration. (r) Payee designation and responsibilities. This subdivision is superseded by
section
633.9
of this Part, effective

October 1, 2017. (1)

Anyone who receives an
individual's income from a benefit paying organization or other payment source
is called a payee. The types of payees are: (i) Own payee. A person who
has been deemed to be capable of handling unearned income and so receives this
income directly. (ii)

Payee
for earnings. An employed person who receives his or her own wages
regardless of whether he or she has achieved ""own payee"" status for unearned
income. (iii)

Representative payee. A party specifically designated in
accordance with the provisions of the Social Security Administration (SSA) to
handle benefits payable to an individual who is deemed, by the SSA, to be
incapable of handling his or her benefits by reason of mental or physical
incapacity. Benefits covered include social security and supplemental security
income (SSI) payments. (iv)

Designated payee. A party, other than a representative payee, who is designated to receive a person's income from a benefit paying
organization other than SSA to handle such income for a person deemed incapable
of handling his or her benefits by reason of mental or physical
incapacity. (2)

When the
payee is the chief executive officer, the agency or sponsoring agency is
mandated by Social Services Law, section 131-o, to manage the personal
allowance portion of that income. No fee may be charged by the agency or
sponsoring agency for managing personal allowance. No documentation of the
arrangement is required. (3)

When
the chief executive officer serves as payee, a record of all monies received
shall be maintained, and reports of these monies shall be made to the benefit
paying organizations, as required. This includes earned income received by an
individual as payee for earnings. (4)

When the chief executive officer serves
as payee, a record of all resources with current values shall be maintained to
meet all benefit paying organization reporting requirements and to ensure that
the entitlement is not jeopardized by an individual's resources exceeding
regulatory limits. This record shall include personal allowance. (5)

When the individual is his or her own
payee, the agency or sponsoring agency shall offer assistance in: (i) reporting both earned and unearned income
to benefit paying organizations, as required; (ii)
reporting resource amounts to benefit
paying organizations, as required; (iii)
monitoring resource amounts to ensure
that the individual's entitlement is not jeopardized through having excess
resources. (6)

When the
payee is other than the chief executive officer, the agency or sponsoring
agency shall extend an offer to manage the individual's personal allowance. The
offer shall be made in writing and within three business days of admission or
change in payee. (s) Non-residential provider responsibilities. If a non-residential provider accepts responsibility for
handling personal allowance monies transferred to it by a residential facility
for a person's use, the following shall apply: (1)

Policies and procedures shall be
established to address at a minimum: usage, security, recordkeeping, accountability of staff, contractors, consultants and volunteers, and
monitoring of all personal allowance monies received by the provider. (2)

There shall be an up-to date person
specific record or ledger maintained detailing receipt, disbursement, and
balance of personal allowance monies. (3)

Receipts shall be required in accordance
with subdivision (l) of this section. (4)

Expenditures shall benefit the person and
items purchased by or for the person shall be his or her personal
property. (5)

Use of personal
allowance shall be in accordance with the individual PEP. Notes

project of which it is the agent or project operator, other than projects for
which an industrial development agency or authority, through the issuance of
its bonds, execution of leases or passage of an inducement or bond resolution, has authorized assistance prior to July 21, 1993. The report is required to be
filed by the agent or project operator; that is, the individual or entity
authorized directly by the industrial development agency or authority to make
tax exempt purchases for the project on behalf of the industrial development
agency or authority. Tenants of the agent or project operator and persons
appointed as agent by the agent or project operator are not the persons

of at the time of purchase or use or by refund or credit) under the authority
of section
874
of the General Municipal Law or section

department and include the following information: (a) name, address and employer identification
number of such agent or project operator; (b) name and address of the industrial

1963
or
2326
of the Public Authorities Law, as the case may be; (j) the signature of the agent or project
operator or its authorized representative; and
(k) any additional information which may be
requested. (ii)

In
addition to the information required in the report, the agent or project
operator may submit with the report the name, address and employer
identification number of any general contractor and any subcontractor or other
agent on the project. (5)

In addition to the records required to be
kept by Part 533 of this Title and section
1135
of the Tax Law, every agent or project
operator of an industrial development agency or authority must maintain the
following records and information for each project on which it is the agent or
project operator: (i) the name, address, and
employer identification number of any general contractor, subcontractor, consultant or other agent on the project; (ii)
the total amounts of New York State and
local sales and compensating use taxes exempted on purchases and uses of
tangible personal property and/or services (whether at the time of purchase or
use or by refund or credit) by or on behalf of the general contractor with
respect to such project, and each subcontractor, consultant or other agent on
the project, respectively, as a result of such project's tax exempt status
pursuant to section
874
of the General Municipal Law or section
1963
or
2326
of the Public Authorities Law, as the case may be; and
(iii)
such other records and information as
is necessary to substantiate the information required to be included on any
report required to be filed pursuant to this Part. (6)
(i) All
records required to be kept and copies of all reports required to be filed by
this Part shall be preserved for a period of three years from the due date of
the annual report to which they relate or the date of filing, if later, and
longer than three years if their contents are material in any action or
proceeding then pending before the Department of Taxation and Finance or in a
judicial proceeding or action. Such records shall be available for inspection
and examination at any time upon demand by the commissioner or the
commissioner's duly authorized agent or employee. The contents of such records
may be required to be reported to the department in connection with the annual
report. Failure by an agent or project operator to furnish such information, upon request by the department, with its annual report required to be filed
under this Part, may subject the agent or project operator to the penalty
provisions provided in subdivision (c) of this section. (ii)

See Part 2402 of this Title for taxpayer
record retention formats. (7)

The annual reports should be mailed to
the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, Attn: IDA Unit, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. Example: K Associates, a manufacturing company, is appointed agent
by an industrial development agency for purposes of constructing and equipping
a project consisting of a manufacturing facility. The industrial development
agency issues a letter to K Associates authorizing it to make purchases exempt
from sales and use taxes for the project as agent of the industrial development
agency. In order to complete the project under the terms of the contract, K
Associates hires a general contractor and various subcontractors to work on the
project. K Associates, as agent for the industrial development authority, must
maintain records and receive information from the general contractor and any
subcontractor, consultant and any other agent, sufficient to compute the total
amounts of sales and compensating use tax exemptions claimed with respect to
the project by the general contractor and each of the subcontractors, consultants and any other agents of K Associates, whether taken at the time of
purchase or use, or by refund or credit. K Associates must also determine the
amount of exemptions it claims relating to its own purchases and uses for the
project for the year. K Associates must report the total amount on the annual
report required to be filed with the department. The general contractor, subcontractors, consultants and other agents which work on the project are not
required to file an annual report with the department under this Part. In order
for K Associates to complete the report required by this Part properly, its
general contractor, subcontractors, consultants and other agents must inform K
Associates of the total amount of the sales and compensating use tax exemptions
to which they are entitled with respect to the project, and K Associates must
maintain records and furnish to the department upon request, the name, address, employer identification number and total amounts of the sales and compensating
use tax exemptions claimed by such general contractor and by each
subcontractor, consultant and other agent on the project. (c) Failure to file
penalty. Where an agent or project operator fails to file a report
required by this section, or files a report which is not substantially
complete, such agent or project operator may be subject to the removal of
authority to act as agent or project operator for the industrial development
agency or authority pursuant to section
874 (8)
of the General

Municipal Law or section
1963-a (9)
or
2327 (9)
of the Public Authorities Law, as
the case may be. (d) Notification of failure to file. (1)

If, within 30 days of the due date for
the report, an agent or project operator has failed to file a report in the
manner required by this section or has filed a report which is not
substantially complete, the department shall notify such agent or project
operator of its noncompliance with this section. (2)

If the agent or project operator fails to
file the required report within 30 days of the date of the department's notice
described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the department shall notify the
agent or project operator and the appropriate industrial development agency or
authority that continued failure to file the required report within 60 days of
the date of the notice provided in this paragraph will result in the removal of
the authority of the agent or project operator to act as agent or project
operator for the agency or authority. The department shall mail a copy of such
notice to the appropriate industrial development agency or authority. (3)

If the department has not received the
required report within 60 days of the date of the notice described in paragraph
(2) of this subdivision, the authority of the agent or project operator to act
as agent or project operator for the industrial development agency or authority
shall terminate as of such 60th day. The department shall, upon expiration of
such 60 days, mail by certified mail to the agent or project operator a notice
of removal of authority to act as agent or project operator for the industrial
development agency or authority. Such notification must: (i) state the effective date of such removal
of authority; (ii)
state the basis
for removal of authority to act as agent or project operator; and
(iii)
advise the person whose authority as
agent or project operator has been removed that the report required by this
section must be filed before such person's authority as agent or project
operator can be restored. The department shall also mail a copy of the notice of
removal of authority described in this paragraph to the appropriate industrial
development agency or authority, the New York State Department of Economic

Development and the State Comptroller. (e) Effect under the Tax Law of
removal of authority to act as an agent or project operator. (1)

Any person whose authority to act as an
agent or project operator has been removed, as well as any agent of such person
(including contractors, subcontractors and consultants), is not entitled to the
sales and compensating use and other tax exemptions provided pursuant to
section
874
of the General Municipal Law or section
1963
or
2326
of the Public Authorities Law, as the case may be. (2)

Any loss of authority for a person to act
as agent or project operator shall remain in effect until the department
restores such person's eligibility to act as an agent or project
operator. (3)
A person whose
authority to act as an agent or project operator has been removed will not be
eligible to act as an agent or project operator until all reports required
under this section are properly completed and filed, to the satisfaction of the
department. Any notice of restoration of authority to act as an agent or
project operator shall be mailed to the same parties as the notice of removal
of authority was mailed, and such restoration shall be effective upon mailing
by the department. (4)

Any person
whose authority to act as agent or project operator has been removed shall be
liable for, and any agent of such person (including contractors, subcontractors
and consultants) may be liable for, any sales and compensating use taxes, as
well as any other taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority of the Tax Law, together with any penalty or interest, which accrued during the time such
removal of authority was in effect, and shall not be entitled to any refund or
credit of any such tax, penalty or interest. Accordingly, the person whose
authority to act as agent or project operator has been removed should promptly
notify its contractors, subcontractors, consultants and other agents of its
loss of authority as an industrial development agency or authority agent or
project operator, as the case may be. Example: K Associates, appointed as agent for an industrial
development authority, is properly notified by the department of the removal of
its authority to act as agent of the industrial development authority, due to
the agent's failure to file the annual report. The effective date of such
removal of authority is July 1st. On October 31st of the same year, K
Associates submits the delinquent report (properly completed) and requests the
department to restore its authority to act as agent for the industrial
development authority. During the period of removal of authority to act as
agent, K Associates is not entitled to any sales and use tax exemptions for the
project and must pay any tax due on purchases and uses of property or services
made for the project during such period. Additionally, such removal of K
Associates' authority to act as agent likewise applies to any of its
contractors, subcontractors, consultants and other agents. Upon the department's restoration of K Associates'
authority to act as agent, K Associates and all its contractors, subcontractors, consultants and other agents are then authorized again to make
purchases for the project exempt from sales and compensating use taxes, provided that K Associates remains the appointed agent of the industrial
development agency. However, neither K Associates nor any of its contractors, subcontractors, consultants or other agents are entitled to any refund or
credit of sales and compensating use taxes required to be paid or due on
purchases and uses of property or services made during the four month period
from July 1st through October 31st when the authority of K Associates to act as
agent was removed. Notes

Title, where the commissioner has permitted the recording officer to accept for
filing a sworn statement of the maximum amount secured or which under any
contingency may be secured by the mortgage as if such statement was filed as of
the date of the recording of the mortgage) and to the extent the mortgage
covers real property located in a county outside the City of New York, interest

State Regulations
(a) An insurance company that maintains one or more separate accounts subject to this Part shall submit to the superintendent annually an actuarial opinion by March 1st and an actuarial memorandum by March 15th following the December 31st valuation date showing the status of such accounts as of December 31st. The actuarial opinion and memorandum must be in form and substance satisfactory to the superintendent. (b) The actuarial opinion shall state that, after taking into account any risk charge payable from the separate account assets and the amount of any reserve liability of the general account with respect to the asset maintenance requirement, the account assets make good and sufficient provision for contract liabilities. The opinion shall be accompanied by a certificate of an officer of the company responsible for the daily monitoring of compliance with the asset maintenance and reserve requirements for such separate accounts, describing the extent to and manner in which during the preceding year: (1)
actual benefit payments conformed to the benefit payments estimated to be made as described in the plan of operations; (2)
the level of risk charges, if any, retained in the general account was appropriate in view of such factors as the nature of the guaranteed contract liabilities and losses experienced in connection with account contracts; and disclosing the data required to be reported in accordance with section
97.5
(m)(1)
of this Part; (3)
after taking into account any reserve liability of the general account with respect to the asset maintenance requirement, the amount of the account assets satisfied the asset maintenance requirement; (4)
the determination of the market-value of the separate account assets conformed to the valuation procedures described in the plan of operations, including (but not limited to), a statement of the procedures and sources of information used during such year; (5)
the fixed-income asset portfolio(s) conformed to, and justified, the rates used to discount contract liabilities for valuation pursuant to section
97.5
(k) of this Part; (6)
if the amount of the asset maintenance requirement depended on the separate account assets, or a subportfolio thereof, being duration matched, the actual experience of the separate account assets or such subportfolio thereof and actual benefit payments conformed to the assumptions made in the plan of operations for determining the duration of such assets and the duration of guaranteed contract liabilities (or the guaranteed contract liabilities funded by the subportfolio); (7)
if the amount of the asset maintenance requirement depended on the separate account assets, or a subportfolio thereof, being cash-flow matched, the cash inflows from the separate account assets or such subportfolio thereof matched the cash outflows to meet guaranteed contract liabilities (or the guaranteed contract liabilities funded by the subportfolio); (8)
any rate or rates used pursuant to section
97.5
(k) of this Part to discount guaranteed contract liabilities and other items applicable to the separate account were modified from the rate or rates described in the plan of operations filed pursuant to section
97.4
(b) of this Part; and
(9)
any assets were transferred to or from the insurance company's general account, or any amounts were paid to the insurance company by any contractholder to support the insurance company's guarantee. (c) The actuarial opinion shall cover the applicable points set forth in section
95.8
of this Title. (d) The actuarial memorandum shall: (1)
either: (i) substantially conform with those portions of Part 95 of this Title that are applicable to testing and demonstrating the sufficiency of assets based upon cash-flow analysis; or
(ii)
demonstrate why cash flow analysis is not appropriate and set forth the procedures used to determine the sufficiency of account assets; (2)
clearly describe the assumptions the qualified actuary used in support of the actuarial opinion, including any assumptions made in projecting cash flows under each class of assets, and any dynamic portfolio hedging techniques utilized and the tests performed on the utilization of such techniques; (3)
clearly describe how the qualified actuary has reflected the risk of default on obligations and mortgage loans, including obligations and mortgage loans that are not investment grade; (4)
if the plan of operations provides for investments in separate account assets other than United States government obligations, demonstrate that the rates used to discount contract liabilities pursuant to section
97.5
(k) of this Part conservatively reflect expected investment returns (taking into account any foreign exchange risks); (5)
if the account contracts provide that in certain circumstances they would cease to be funded by a separate account and, instead, would become contracts funded by the general account, clearly describe how any increased reserves would be provided for if and to the extent such circumstances occurred; (6)
state the amount of reserves and supporting assets as of December 31st and where such reserves are shown in the annual statement; and
(7)
state the amount of any contingency reserve carried as part of surplus. Notes

Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.32 - Executive Order No. 32: [Establishing Breast Cancer Advisory Committee.]
State Regulations

Breast cancer is a major public health problem that
warrants the most serious efforts by the State to reduce its ravages. It is the
leading cause of death among women age 40 to 44, reaching almost epidemic
proportions in recent years. The mortality of breast cancer can be dramatically
reduced if the disease is detected at its initial stage. Therefore, an
aggressive and comprehensive program of breast cancer detection is critically
important. The means for treating this serious problem may be at hand
through improved techniques of early detection and new methods of treatment. Programs for detection, however, are rarely properly organized or coordinated
with the essential treatment and follow-up services. Therefore, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of New

York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of
the State of New York, in order to insure that the State assume a leadership
role in coordinating the diverse public and private efforts in the fight
against breast cancer, and in order to provide the best possible information
concerning proper modes of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care
for breast cancer to the people of New York, do hereby direct the Commissioner
of Health to develop a statewide comprehensive plan for an early detection
system for breast cancer. To advise and assist the Commissioner of Health in the
acquisition of relevant data and in the preparation and implementation of the
statewide comprehensive plan, I hereby establish a Breast Cancer Advisory

Committee, to consist of 16 members appointed by the Governor and to be
comprised of recognized experts in the fields of medicine, health economics, education and public health for breast cancer control programs, as well as
private individuals widely experienced in the fight against breast
cancer. The Committee shall solicit and interpret data from
recognized breast cancer screening centers and other breast cancer authorities
and shall advise the Commissioner of Health on the development, implementation
and policy direction of the statewide comprehensive plan. The Commissioner of Health shall be responsible for
collecting and analyzing data, formulating standards and guidelines, conducting
such studies as are advisable and organizing and coordinating the diverse
private and public resource expenditures for the purpose of early detection. The plan he derives must identify a statewide early detection system which will
be interrelated with the health system's treatment resources for appropriate
follow-up and case management as well as for general educational
purposes. The Commissioner of Health is hereby directed to submit to
the Governor a statewide comprehensive plan for the early detection and
treatment of breast cancer. He is directed to make periodic progress reports on
the development of this plan at three-month intervals from the date of this

Order and to submit progress reports on implementation of the plan at six-month
intervals from the date of its submission. Signed: Hugh L. Carey

State Regulations

Article 11-AA of the General Municipal Law authorizes the
establishment of defined contribution service award programs to provide
municipally-funded, pension-like benefits for volunteer ambulance workers. Service award programs may be adopted by political subdivisions for the
volunteer ambulance workers of ambulance companies which are either: (a) under the control of the governing board
of the political subdivision; or
(b) in the political subdivision and under
contract with the governing board to provide service therein. Adoption of a service award program requires the affirmative
vote of at least 60 percent of the governing board of the political subdivision
and the approval of a proposition at a referendum of the eligible voters of the
political subdivision. Article 11-AA requires the service award programs to be
centrally administered by the State Comptroller, or by an administrative
service agency and/or one or more financial organizations selected by the
comptroller. The comptroller is also required to promulgate rules and
regulations for the programs. The rules and regulations must, at a minimum, include standards for the selection of financial organizations, the method and
timing of contributions to the programs by local government sponsors, the
reporting on individual participant accounts, matters relating to the
preparation of a plan document and any other matter properly pertaining
thereto. Notes

equivalent tests of the merit and fitness of candidates. The name of any
candidate who passes any such examination and who is otherwise qualified shall

candidates for certification and appointment from such continuing eligible
list, as a result of any such examination, shall be fixed by the Chief

Administrator but, except as a list may reach an announced terminal date, such
period shall not be less than one year; nor shall such period of eligibility
exceed four years, except as provided in section

The Chief Administrator of the Courts may establish a continuing eligible list for any class of positions for which inadequate numbers of qualified persons are found available for recruitment or appointment. Names of eligibles shall be inserted in such list from time to time as applicants are tested and found qualified in examinations held at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Chief Administrator. Such successive examinations shall, so far as practicable, be constructed and rated so as to be equivalent tests of the merit and fitness of candidates. The name of any candidate who passes any such examination and who is otherwise qualified shall be placed on the continuing eligible list in the rank corresponding to his or her final rating on such examination. The period of eligibility of successful candidates for certification and appointment from such continuing eligible list, as a result of any such examination, shall be fixed by the Chief Administrator but, except as a list may reach an announced terminal date, such period shall not be less than one year; nor shall such period of eligibility exceed four years, except as provided in section

Section

of the Tax Law
imposes liability for the tax upon the person or persons making or effectuating
the sale or transfer, including the person or persons to whom the sale or
transfer is made. Thus, both transferor and transferee (and also any agent or
broker of either the transferor or the transferee) are liable, and if a
transfer is made on the books of the corporation, it is also liable. The
parties to a transaction may agree which of them shall bear this liability and
payment of the tax by either discharges the liability of both. However, if the
party who has agreed to pay the tax fails to do so, the other party is not
exonerated from liability by such agreement and in such case payment may be
enforced against either party. Notes
