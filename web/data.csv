State Regulations
(a) The landlord and tenant in occupancy may voluntarily enter into a valid written
lease, on or after August 1, 1970, in good faith with respect to any housing
accommodation, which provides for an increase in the maximum rent on the basis
of specified increased services, furniture, furnishings or equipment having a
market value commensurate with the increased rent, which is not in excess of 15
percent of the maximum rent in effect on the date of execution of such lease, and the lease is for a term of not less than two years. No increase pursuant to
this section shall be authorized with respect to a housing accommodation for
which an increase has been effected, pursuant to section
2201.3
(c) of this

Title, on the basis of a vacancy of the housing accommodation until January 1, 1972, or one year after such increase has become effective as a result of such
vacancy, whichever date comes later. No increase shall be authorized unless a
report of lease is filed as required by subdivision (d) of this section, or
such report has been otherwise accepted by the administrator. Such lease or
such lease report: (1)
contains a
certification by the landlord that he is maintaining all essential services
furnished or required to be furnished as of the date determining the maximum
rent, and will continue to maintain such services so long as the increase in
maximum rent continues in effect; (2)
gives the landlord no right of
cancellation of said lease inconsistent with the provisions of these
regulations; (3)
does not provide
for the payment by the tenant of any rent in excess of the amount therein
provided, unless the maximum rent is thereafter increased: (i) by order of the administrator pursuant to
section
2202.4
(a) of this

Part; or
(ii)
pursuant to
subdivision (b), (c), (d) or (e) of such section, where the improvement or
substantial rehabilitation of the building or housing accommodations therein
was either completed or in progress when such lease was executed; or
(iii)
pursuant to a pending application for a
financial adjustment of the maximum rents for the subject building pursuant to
section
2201.3
of this Title, or section
2202.8, 2202.9, 2202.10 or
2202.11
of this Part; or
(iv)
pursuant to a deferred financial
adjustment order which was not fully effective; and
(4)
gives the tenant the right to cancel such
lease at any time after the expiration of the first two years thereof, by
giving the landlord at least 30 days' notice in writing, by registered or
certified mail of his intention to cancel such lease and surrender possession
of the housing accommodations. (b) Where a maximum rent was established by
the execution of a lease pursuant to the provisions of this section, it may not
thereafter be increased by a subsequent lease executed with the same tenant
pursuant to this section, except: (1)
by a
subsequent written lease in accordance with subdivision (a) of this section, where the rent provided by such subsequent lease does not result in an increase
of more than 15 percent over the maximum rent in effect prior to the execution
of the original lease, exclusive of adjustments ordered by the administrator; or
(2)
where, after the expiration
of the term of the original lease, or in a case where the original lease is
terminated after the expiration of the first two years of its term, a new
written lease may be entered into in accordance with such subdivision (a) of
this section; or
(3)
where the
original lease is terminated after the expiration of the first year of its
term, in which event a new written lease in accordance with such subdivision
(a) of this section may be entered into for a term of not less than the
unexpired remainder of the first two years of the original lease plus two
years, and providing for an increase commencing with the expiration of the
first two years of the original lease, which increase shall not exceed 15
percent over the maximum rent in effect on the effective date of such new
lease. (c) Where the
entire structure, or any lesser portion thereof, was vacated by order of a city
department having jurisdiction on or after November 22, 1963, and any tenants
therein were relocated by the Department of Relocation or such structure was
boarded up by the Department of Real Estate, such lease increases in
subsequently executed leases shall not become effective for any housing
accommodations in the structure, notwithstanding any provision of subdivision
(a) of this section to the contrary, until such departments have been
reimbursed for expenses necessarily incurred in connection with the foregoing; provided, however, that such reimbursement shall not be required where the
vacating was caused by fire or accident not resulting from any unlawful act or
omission on the part of the landlord. (d) Within 60 days following the date of
execution of the lease, or within 60 days after the effective date of this
amendment, whichever date is later, the landlord shall file a report of such
lease, upon forms prescribed by the administrator, which shall also include a
statement of additional services or equipment furnished as a consideration of
the execution of the lease. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, where a
maximum base rent is established pursuant to section
2201.4
of this Title, during the
term of any lease entered into on or after August 1, 1970 pursuant to the
provisions of this section, such maximum base rent shall be collectible up to
the 71/2 percent limitation provided for by section
2201.6
of this Title, even though
such lease provides for the payment of a lesser amount. Notes

(a) Application. The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law), as amended by chapter 395 of the Laws of 1928, shall apply to the well located on land owned by the Greenlawn Water District and situated on a plot of ground in the unincorporated village of Centerport in the town of Huntington, 350 feet north of the Huntington-Northport Road at the head of Northport Harbor, or to any additional wells which may be constructed on this property which forms the source of the public water supply of the Greenlawn Water District, town of Huntington, Suffolk County, NY. (b) Definitions. (1)

The term well wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to the well now used as a source of this public water supply or to any additional well which may be constructed at this point for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)

Wherever a linear distance of a structure or object from the well is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the well. (c) Privies adjacent to the well. (1)

No privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind placed or used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of the well of the public water supply of the Greenlawn Water District. (2)

No privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle, which is not watertight, placed or used for the permanent deposit of human excreta, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of the well of the public water supply of the Greenlawn Water District. (3)

Every privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for the temporary storage of human excreta, located between the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be arranged in such a manner that all excreta shall be received in a suitable watertight receptacle or removable container which shall be emptied as set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision. (4)

Whenever the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers become filled within six inches of the top, said receptacles or containers shall be emptied or removed and the contents disposed of as hereinafter provided in order to maintain the privy or receptacle in proper sanitary condition and effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transported from the privy or receptacle to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents or the removable containers, while being transported, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)

Unless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits and covered with not less than 12 inches of soil in such a manner as effectually to prevent their being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance of not less than 500 feet from the well of the public water supply of the Greenlawn Water District. (6)

Whenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into the well, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the said trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.

No garbage, putrescible matter, kitchen or sink wastes, refuse or waste matter from any garage nor any polluted water or liquid of any kind shall be thrown or discharged upon the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface (except into watertight containers, the contents of which are to be removed as provided by paragraphs [c][4] and [5] of this section) within 200 feet of the well of the public water supply of the Greenlawn Water District. (e) Animals, manure, compost, etc. (1)

No manure pile or compost heap shall be located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of the well of the public water supply of the Greenlawn Water District and no such manure pile or compost heap shall be located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain where or in such a manner that the drainings, leachings or washings from the same may enter the well without first having passed over or through such an extent of soil as to have been properly purified, and in no case shall it be deemed that proper purification has been secured unless the aforesaid drainings, leachings or washings shall have percolated over or through the soil in a scattered, dissipated form and not concentrated in perceptible lines of drainage for a distance of not less than 200 feet from the well of the public water supply of the Greenlawn Water District. (2)

No human excreta and no compost or other matter containing human excreta shall be thrown, placed, piled or spread upon the surface of the ground, nor shall such human excreta, compost or other matter containing human excreta be buried in the soil unless covered with not less than 12 inches of soil nor within a distance of 500 feet of the well; and no manure or compost of any kind shall be placed, piled or spread upon the ground within a distance of 200 feet of the well of the public water supply of the Greenlawn Water District.

State Regulations
(a) For housing accommodations which on the
local effective date of the act were under rent control pursuant to the

Emergency Housing Rent Control Law, and on or after that date become vacant and
are no longer under rent control, and which are rented thereafter and subject
to the act, the initial legal regulated rent shall be the rent agreed to by the
landlord and the tenant and reserved in a lease or provided for in a rental
agreement. (b) For all other
housing accommodations subject to the act, the initial legal regulated rent
shall be the rent reserved in the last effective lease or other rental
agreement prior to the local effective date of the act. (c) (1)

Where an owner combines two or more vacant housing accommodations or combines a
vacant housing accommodation with an occupied accommodation, such initial rent
for such new housing accommodation shall be the combined legal rent for both
previous housing accommodations, subject to any applicable guideline increases
and any other increases authorized by this Title including any individual
apartment improvement increases applicable for both housing accommodations. If
an owner combines a rent regulated accommodation with an apartment not subject
to rent regulation, the resulting apartment shall be subject to the ETPA. If an
owner increases the area of an apartment not subject to rent regulation by
adding space that was previously part of a rent regulated apartment, each
apartment shall be subject to the ETPA. (2)

Where an owner substantially increases
the outer dimension of a vacant housing accommodation, such initial rent shall
be the prior rent of such housing accommodation, increased by a percentage that
is equal to the percentage increase in the dwelling space and such other
increases authorized by this Title including any applicable guideline increase
and individual apartment improvement increase that could be authorized for the
unit prior to the alteration of the outer dimensions. (3)

Notwithstanding the above, the above
increases may be denied based on the occurrence of such vacancy due to
harassment, fraud, or other acts of evasion which may require that such rent be
set in accordance with Part 2506 of this Title. (4)

Where the vacant housing accommodations
are combined, modified, divided or the dimension of such housing accommodation
otherwise altered and these changes are being made pursuant to a preservation
regulatory agreement with a federal, state or local governmental agency or
instrumentality, the rent stabilized rents charged thereafter shall be based on
an initial rent set by such agency or instrumentality. (5)

Where an owner substantially decreases
the outer dimensions of a vacant housing accommodation, such initial rent shall
be the prior rent of such housing accommodation, decreased by the same
percentage the square footage of the original apartment was decreased by and
such other increases authorized by this Title including any applicable
guideline increase and individual apartment improvement increases that could be
authorized for the apartment prior to the alteration of the outer
dimensions. (6)

Apartment
combinations and individual apartment improvements. (i) When an owner combines two or more rent
regulated apartments, the owner may use each of the previous apartments'
remaining individual apartment improvement allowances for the purposes of a
temporary individual apartment improvement rent increase. The owner shall
subsequently designate a surviving apartment for the purposes of registration
that has the same apartment number as one of the prior apartments. If that
prior apartment has any reimbursable individual apartment improvement money
remaining after the combination, that money may be reimbursed for future
individual apartment improvements undertaken within the subsequent fifteen
years following the combination. (ii)

In order for an owner to qualify for a
temporary individual apartment improvement rent increase when apartments are
combined, the requirements for an individual apartment improvement, including
all notification requirements under Section
2502.4
(c)(2)
of
this Title must be met. (7)

Owners shall maintain the records and
rent histories of all combined apartments, both prior to and post combination, for the purposes of rent setting, overcharge and all other proceedings to which
the records are applicable. (d) For housing accommodations made subject
to this Title as of June 14, 2019 as set forth in 2500.9(f), (j) and (k) the
initial rents thereafter upon vacatur of the not for profit and affiliated
subtenant shall be set using the rent in effect for a regulated tenant in
occupancy immediately prior to occupancy by the not for profit and the
affiliated subtenant plus any applicable increases. Notes

State Regulations
(a) An
applicant for a moving expense and/or replacement housing payment shall be
notified promptly in writing concerning his eligibility for the payment
claimed; the amount, if any, he is entitled to receive, and the time and manner
in which such payment will be made. If any or all of the amounts claimed are
disallowed or require additional documentation, the eligible person will be so
notified in writing to this effect. (b) If the claimant is not satisfied with the
payment offered, he may within 18 months of vacating or six months after final
award determination by the courts of the State request an informal conference
to present his case. When requested, such a conference is scheduled in the
regional office conducted by the local real property officer. The claimant may
bring whomever he wishes to represent him or present some facet of his claim. The decision of the local real property officer will be made in writing
directed to the claimant or his representative and may be appealed to the
director of real property. (c) The
director of real property shall then make an independent determination
according to the data submitted to him by the claimant and the local real
property officer. This determination will be made in writing to the
claimant. (d) In the event the
claimant is not satisfied with the results achieved at this stage he may then
request a formal hearing. This request will be directed to the director of real
property. The formal hearing will be conducted by a hearing officer designated
by the commissioner at a time and place to be determined by the hearing
officer. Minutes of the proceedings will be taken. (e) Based upon all the evidence produced at
the hearing, the hearing officer will make his recommendation to the
commissioner who will then make a final determination regarding the claim
presented. (f) In the instance of
an appeal, no payment of such calculated moving expenses or supplemental
housing and related benefits is to be made until a decision has been rendered
by the director. In the instance where an owner files a claim in the Court of

Claims for adjudication of the fair market value of the property acquired, and
similarly files for an appeal hearing disputing the amount of the supplemental
payment proffered, no appeal hearing will be held until final award
determination by the courts of the State. Notes

State Regulations

Producer-handler means a handler who, following the
filing of an application pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section has been
so designated by the market administrator upon determination that the
requirements of subdivision (b) of this section have been met. Such designation
shall be effective on the first of the month after receipt by the market
administrator of an application containing complete information on the basis of
which the market administrator determines that the requirements of subdivision
(b) are being met. The effective date of designation shall be governed by the
date of filing new applications in instances where applications previously
filed have been denied. All designations shall remain in effect until cancelled
pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section. (a) Application. Any handler claiming to meet
the requirements of subdivision (b) of this section may file with the market
administrator, on forms prescribed by the market administrator, an application
for designation as a producer-handler. The application shall contain the
following information: (1)
A listing and
description of all resources and facilities used for the production of milk
which are owned or directly or indirectly operated or controlled by the
applicant. (2)
A listing and
discription of all resources and facilities used for the processing or
distribution of milk or milk products which are owned, or directly or
indirectly operated or controlled by the applicant. (3)
A description of any other resources and
facilities used in the production, handling, or processing of milk or milk
products in which the applicant in any way has an interest, including any
contractual arrangement, and the names of any other persons having or
exercising any degree of ownership, management, or control in, or with whom
there exists any contractual arrangement with respect to, the applicant's
operation either in his capacity as a handler or in his capacity as a dairy
farmer. (4)
A listing and
description of the resources and facilities used in the production, processing, and distribution of milk or milk products which the applicant desires to be
determined as his milk production, processing, and distribution unit in
connection with his designation as a producer-handler: provided, that all milk
production resources and facilities owned, operated, or controlled by he
applicant either directly or indirectly shall be considered as constituting a
part of the applicant's milk production unit in the absence of proof
satisfactory to the market administrator that some portion of such facilities
or resources do not constitute an actual or potential source of milk supply for
the applicant's operation as a producer-handler. (5)

Such other information as may be required
by the market administrator. (b) Requirements. (1)

The handler has and exercises (in his
capacity as a handler) complete and exclusive control over the operation and
management of a plant at which he handles milk received from production
facilities and resources (milking herd, buildings housing such herd, and the
land on which such buildings are located) the operation and management of which
also are under the complete and exclusive control of the handler (in his
capacity as a dairy farmer), all of which facilities and resources for the
production, processing, and distribution of milk and milk products constitute
an integrated operation over which the handler (in his capacity as a
producer-handler) has and exercises complete and exclusive control. (2)

The handler, in his capacity as a
handler, handles no fluid milk products other than those derived from the milk
production facilities and resources designated as constituting the applicant's
operation as a producer-handler. (3)

The handler is not, either directly or
indirectly, associated with control or management of the operation of another
plant or another handler, nor is another handler so associated with his
operation. (4)

The handler sells
more than an average of 100 quarts per day of Class I-A milk to persons in the
marketing area other than to other plants. (5)

In case the plant of the applicant was
operated by a handler whose designation as a producer-handler previously had
been cancelled pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, the quantity of
fluid milk products handled during the 12 months preceding the application
which was derived from sources other than the designated milk production
facilities and resources constituting the applicant's operation as a
producer-handler is less than the volume set forth for cancellation pursuant to
paragraphs (3) or (4) of subdivision (c) of this section. (c) Cancellation. The designation as a
producer-handler shall be cancelled under conditions set forth in paragraphs
(1) and (2) of this subdivision or, except as specified in paragraphs (3) and
(4) of this subdivision, upon determination by the market administrator that
any of the requirements of subdivision (b) of this section are not continuing
to be met, such cancellation to be effective on the first day of the month
following the month in which the requirements were not met. (1)

Milk from the designated production
facilities and resources of the producer-handler is delivered in the name of
another person as pool milk to another handler or except in the months of June
through November with prior notice to the market administrator, a dairy herd, cattle barn, or milking parlor is transferred to another person who uses such
facilities or resources for producing milk which is delivered as pool milk to
another handler. This provision, however, shall not be deemed to preclude the
occasional sale of individual cows from the herd. (2)
A dairy herd, cattle barn, or milking
parlor, previously used for the production of milk delivered as pool milk to
another handler, is added to the designated milk production facilities and
resources of the producer-handler, except in the months of December through

May, with prior notice to the market administrator, or if such facilities and
resources were a part of the designated production facilities and resources
during any of the preceding 12 months. This provision, however, shall not be
deemed to preclude the occasional purchase of individual cows for the
herd. (3)

If the producer-handler
handles an average of more than 150 product pounds per day of fluid milk
products which are derived from sources other than the designated milk
production facilities and resources, the cancellation of designation shall be
effective the first of the month in which he handled such fluid milk
products. (4)

If the
producer-handler handles fluid milk products derived from sources other than
the designated milk production facilities and resources in a volume less than
specified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the designation shall be
cancelled effective on the first of the month following the third month in any
six-month period in which the producer-handler handled such fluid milk
products: provided, that the receipt of up to an average of 10 pounds per day
of packaged fluid milk products in the form of fluid skim milk, or of any
volume of other packaged fluid milk products (except milk) from pool plants, shall not be counted for purposes of this paragraph. (d) Public announcement. The market
administrator shall publicly announce the name, plant, and farm location of
persons designated as producer-handlers, and those whose designations have been
canceled. Such announcements shall be controlling with respect to the
accounting at plants of other handlers for fluid milk products received from
such producer-handler on and after the first of the month following the date of
such announcement. (e) Burden of
establishing and maintaining producer-handler status. The burden rests upon the
handler who is designated as a producer-handler (and upon the applicant for
such designation) to establish through records required pursuant to section
19.5
that the requirements set
forth in subdivision (b) of this section have been and are continuing to be met
and that the conditions set forth in subdivision (c) of this section for
cancelation of designation do not exist. Notes

State Regulations
(a) Upon notice
and reasonable opportunity to be heard, the division may issue orders it deems
appropriate to enforce the act and this Chapter. (b) If the division finds that any landlord
has knowingly engaged in acts prohibited by the act and regulations or orders
issued thereunder, it may assess the landlord and order it to pay each tenant
affected by such acts the reasonable costs and attorney fees of the proceeding
plus a penalty not in excess of $250 for each such act. If the landlord has not
instituted a proceeding pursuant to article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and

Rules and has not paid the assessment and penalties upon the expiration of the
time to do so, each affected tenant may offset against any rent thereafter due
the landlord the unpaid amount not in excess of 20 percent thereof per
month. (c) If a landlord is found
by the division: (1)
to have violated an
order of the division, the division may impose by administrative order after
hearing, civil penalties at minimum in the amount of $1,000 but not to exceed
$2,000 for the first such offense and at minimum $2,000 not to exceed $3,000
for each subsequent offense; or
(2)
to have harassed a tenant to obtain vacancy of a housing accommodation, the
division may impose by administrative order after hearing, a civil penalty at
minimum in the amount of $2,000 not to exceed $3,000 for the first such offense
and at minimum $10,000 not to exceed $11,000 for each subsequent offense or for
a violation consisting of conduct directed at the tenant of more than one
housing accommodation. (d) Any owner who has been found by the DHCR
to have refused to comply with an order of the DHCR or to have harassed a
tenant shall, in addition to being subject to any other penalties or remedies
permitted by law or by this Code, be barred thereafter from applying for or
collecting any further rent increase for the affected housing accommodation. The finding by the DHCR that the owner has complied with such order or that the
conduct which resulted in the finding of harassment has ceased, shall result in
the prospective elimination of the sanctions provided for in this section. Such
orders shall be deemed final determinations for the purposes of judicial review
pursuant to Part 2510.12 of this Title. (e) The failure of any owner to pay any fine, penalty or assessment authorized by the ETPA or this Title shall, until such
fine, penalty or assessment is paid, bar an owner from applying for or
collecting any further rent increases for such housing accommodation. The late
payment of any fine, penalty or assessment shall result in the prospective
elimination of such sanction. Such penalties may, upon the expiration of the
period for seeking review pursuant to article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and

Rules, be docketed and enforced in the manner of a judgment of the Supreme

Court. Notes

(b) [Definitions.]
(1)

The term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to all storage and impounding reservoirs on Furnace Brook which are tributary to or which serve as sources of this public water supply or to any additional reservoir which may be constructed or used for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)

The term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than the artificial reservoir), stream, ditch, gutter or other channel of any kind, the waters of which when running, whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into the public water supply of the Peru Water District. (3)

Wherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)

No privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of any reservoir or within 75 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Peru Water District. (2)

No privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 300 feet of any reservoir or within 100 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Peru Water District. (3)

No privy, cesspool, pit or other receptacle of any kind used for the temporary deposit or storage of human excreta or sewage shall be constructed, located, maintained or allowed to remain between the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision unless said cesspool, pit or other receptacle is made watertight and so arranged and equipped that the said excreta or sewage are at once removed by pump or other satisfactory means through watertight pipes or conduits to some proper place of ultimate disposal, as hereinafter provided, or unless suitable removable vessels or receptacles for the temporary storage of said human excreta or sewage are provided and at all times maintained in an absolutely watertight condition and in such manner as to permit of convenient removal of said excreta or sewage to some place of ultimate disposal as hereinafter set forth. (4)

The excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall be removed and the receptacles thoroughly cleaned and deodorized as often as may be found necessary to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents, while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)

Unless otherwise specially ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits at a depth of not less than 18 inches below the surface and at a distance not less than 500 feet from any reservoir nor within 300 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Peru Water District and in such a manner and at such a place as to effectually prevent its being washed over the surface of or through the ground in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Peru Water District. (6)

Whenever, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or to other special local conditions, it is considered by the State Commissioner of Health that excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal or the garbage or wastes from any dump may be washed over the surface or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the trench or place of disposal or the said garbage or waste dump shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health. (d) Sewage, house slops, sink wastes. (1)

No house slops, bath water, sewage or other excretal matter from any water closet, privy, cesspool or other source shall be thrown, placed, led, conducted, discharged or allowed to escape or flow in any manner either directly or indirectly into any reservoir or any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Peru Water District, nor shall any such matters be thrown, placed, led, discharged or allowed to escape or flow on the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface except into watertight receptacles, the contents of which are to be removed as provided by paragraph (4) of subdivision (c), within 300 feet of any reservoir or within 100 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Peru Water District. (2)

State Regulations
(a) Applicability. This section shall be applicable to residential mortgage
foreclosure actions involving a home loan secured by a mortgage on a one- to
four-family dwelling or condominium, in which the defendant is a resident of
the property subject to foreclosure. (b) Request for judicial intervention. (1)

At the time that proof of service of the
summons and complaint is filed with the county clerk, plaintiff shall file with
the county clerk a specialized request for judicial intervention (RJI), on a
form prescribed by the Chief Administrator of the Courts, applicable to
residential mortgage foreclosure actions covered by this section. The RJI shall
contain the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, if available, of the defendant in the action, and the name of the mortgage servicer, and
shall request that a settlement conference be scheduled. Any P.O. Box or other
alternate addresses associated with the defendant of which the servicer or its
attorney is aware shall also be listed. If the mortgage servicer involved in
the case and listed on the RJI is changed at any time following the filing of
the RJI, plaintiff shall file with the court and serve on all the parties a
notice setting forth the name and contact information of the new or substituted
mortgage servicer. (2)

Upon the
filing of the RJI, the court shall send either a copy of the RJI, or the
defendant's name, address and telephone number (if available), to a housing
counseling agency or agencies funded by the New York State Office of the

Attorney General's Homeowner Protection Program for the judicial district in
which the defendant resides, for the purpose of that agency making the
homeowner aware of free foreclosure prevention services and options available
to the parties. (3)

In such county
or counties as the Chief Administrator shall direct, in the event that a
plaintiff fails to file proof of service of the summons and complaint in a
residential mortgage foreclosure action with the county clerk within one
hundred twenty days after the commencement of the action, or fails to file the
RJI at the time of the filing of proof of service, the county clerk shall
provide the Chief Administrator with the case name, index number, property
address, and contact information of parties and counsel in the action. The

Chief Administrator may take such further action as she deems fit with respect
to such case or cases, including but not limited to
(a) placing a case on a delinquency
calendar; (b) providing case
information to a housing counseling agency or agencies; and
(c) ordering a status conference. (c) Settlement
conference. (1)

The court shall promptly send
to the parties a Notice scheduling a settlement conference to be held within 60
days after the date of the filing of the RJI. The Notice shall be mailed to all
parties or their attorneys, which must include mailing to the address of the
property subject to the mortgage. The Notice shall be on a form prescribed by
the Chief Administrator, and it shall set forth the purpose of the conference, the requirements of CPLR Rule 3408, instructions to the parties on how to
prepare for the conference, and what information and documents to bring to the
conference as specified in CPLR Rule 3408(e). The Notice shall further provide
that the defendant contact the court by telephone, no later than seven days
before the conference is scheduled, to advise whether the defendant will be
able to at tend the scheduled conference. The court shall also provide in such
mailing a copy of the current Consumer Bill of Rights published by the New York

State Department of Financial Services pursuant to RPA PL §
1303-3-a. (2)

The conference shall
be held to conduct settlement discussions pertaining to the relative rights and
obligations of the parties under the mortgage loan documents, including
determining whether the parties can reach a mutually agreeable resolution to
help the defendant avoid losing his or her home, and evaluating the potential
for a resolution in which payment schedules or amounts may be modified or other
workout options may be agreed to, including but not limited to loan
modifications, ""short sales"" and ""deeds in lieu of foreclosure"" or any other
loss mitigation options. The court may also use the conference for whatever
other purposes the court deems appropriate. Where appropriate, the court may
permit representatives of either party to attend the conference telephonically
or by video-conference. Any representative participating in the conference, whether in person, telephonically or by video conference, shall be fully
authorized to dispose of the case, as required by CPLR Rule 3408(c). (3)

If the parties appear by counsel, such
counsel must be fully authorized to dispose of the case. If the defendant
appears at the conference without counsel, the court shall treat the defendant
as having made a motion to proceed as a poor person and shall determine whether
permission to so appear shall be granted pursuant to the standards set forth in
CPLR § 1101. If the court appoints defendant counsel pursuant to CPLR
§ 1102(a), it shall adjourn the conference to a date certain for
appearance of counsel and settlement discussions, and otherwise shall proceed
with the conference. (4)

The
parties shall engage in settlement discussions in good faith to reach a
mutually agreeable resolution, including a loan modification if possible, consistent with CPLR Rule 3408(f). The court shall ensure that each party
fulfills its obligation to negotiate in good faith and shall see that
conferences not be unduly delayed or subject to willful dilatory tactics so
that the rights of both parties may be adjudicated in a timely manner. The
court shall ensure that procedures are in place to enforce the duty to
negotiate in good faith, as defined in CPLR Rule 3408(f), consistent with the
mandates of CPLR Rule 3408(i), (j) and (k). (5)

Documents. (i) Plaintiff and Defendant shall bring all
documents enumerated in CPLR Rule 3408(e) to each conference held pursuant to
CPLR Rule 3408, in addition to any other documents require d by the judge, referee or judicial hearing officer presiding over the case. (6)

At the first conference held
pursuant to CPLR Rule 3408, the court shall determine if the defendant has
answered the complaint and shall provide defendants who have not answered
information as mandated by CPLR Rule 3408(1). The court shall ensure that
procedures are in place to note the vacatur of any defaults upon service and
filing of answers pursuant to CPLR Rule 3408(m). The court shall schedule such
other conferences as may be necessary to help resolve the action. (7)

All motions, other than motions
addressing compliance with CPLR Rule 3408 or this rule, shall be held in
abeyance while settlement conferences are being held pursuant to this section. A party may not charge, impose or otherwise require payment from the other
party for any cost, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, for
appearance at or participation in the settlement conference. (8)

Plaintiff must file a notice of
discontinuance or stipulation of discontinuance and vacatur of the notice of
pendency within 90 days after any settlement agreement or loan modification
agreement is fully executed. (d) Training. The Chief Administrator shall
establish requirements for education and training of all judges and nonjudicial
personnel assigned to conduct foreclosure conferences pursuant to this section. (e) Reports. The Chief

Administrator shall submit a report no later than the first day of November of
each year to the Governor, and to the legislative leaders set forth in section
10-a(2) of chapter 507 of the Laws of 2009, on the adequacy and effectiveness
of the settlement conferences, which shall include number of adjournments, defaults, discontinuances, dismissals, conferences held and the number of
defendants appearing with and without counsel. (f) The Chief Administrator of the Courts may
continue to require counsel to file affidavits or affirmations confirming the
scope of inquiry and the accuracy of papers filed in residential mortgage
foreclosure actions addressing both owner-occupied and (not with standing
section supra) non-owner-occupied residential properties. Notes

State Regulations
(a) Antigradation of waters. (1)

Interstate waters. It is the policy of the commission to maintain the quality
of interstate waters, where existing quality is better than the established
stream quality objectives, unless it can be affirmatively demonstrated to the
commission that such change is justifiable as a result of necessary economic or
social development or to improve significantly another body of water. In
implementing this policy, the commission will require the highest degree of
waste treatment determined to be practicable. No change will be considered
which would be injurious to any designated present or future use. (2)

Special protection waters. It is the
policy of the commission that there be no measurable change in existing water
quality except towards natural conditions in waters considered by the
commission to have exceptionally high scenic, recreational, ecological, and/or
water supply values. Waters with exceptional values may be classified by the
commission as either outstanding basin waters or significant resource waters. In determining waters suitable for classification as special protection waters, the commission will consider nomination petitions from local, State and Federal
agencies and governing bodies, and the public for waters potentially meeting
the definition of outstanding basin waters and significant resource waters as
described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. The following policies shall
apply to waters classified by the commission as outstanding basin waters or
significant resource waters and their drainage areas: (i) Definitions. (a) Outstanding basin waters
are interstate and contiguous intrastate waters that are contained within the
established boundaries of national parks; national wild, scenic and
recreational rivers systems; and/or national wildlife refuges that are
classified by the commission under clause (vii)(
a
) of this
paragraph hereof as having exceptionally high scenic, recreational, and
ecological values that require special protection. (b) Significant resource
waters
are interstate waters classified by the commission under clause
(vii)(
b
) of this paragraph hereof as having exceptionally high
scenic, recreational, ecological, and/or water supply uses that require special
protection. (c) Existing
water quality
for purposes of the Special Protection Waters Program is
defined for a limited set of parameters, consisting of those listed in tables 1
and 2. Existing water quality is defined in table 1 for stream reaches between

Hancock, New York and the Delaware Water Gap and in table 2 for stream reaches
between the Delaware Water Gap and Trenton, New Jersey. Where existing water
quality is not defined in tables 1 and 2, existing water quality may be defined
by extrapolation from the nearest upstream or downstream interstate control
point, from data obtained from sites within the same ecoregion, or on the basis
of best scientific judgement. (d) Measurable change to existing water quality
is defined as an
actual or estimated change in a seasonal or non-seasonal mean (for SPW waters
upstream of and including river mile 209.5*) or median (for SPW waters
downstream of river mile 209.5) in-stream pollutant concentration that is
outside the range of the two-tailed upper and lower 95 percent confidence
intervals that define existing water
quality. *
(e) Public interest
is a
determination of all the positive and negative social, economic and water
resource impacts associated with a project affecting a significant resource
water. A project that is in the public interest is one that, at a minimum, provides housing, employment, and/or public facilities needed to accommodate
the adopted future population, land use, and other goals of a community and
region without causing deleterious impacts on the local and regional
environment and economy. In general, such a project would be one that conforms
to a locally adopted growth management plan which is undergoing active
implementation by local officials, is supported by the larger community as a
whole, and is compatible with national, State and regional objectives as well. For a project not fully meeting the above criteria, the commission will weigh
the positive and negative impacts to determine public interest. (f) Regional resources management
plan
is a management plan developed and adopted by the government
agency that is assigned primary responsibilities for the overall management of
a national park, scenic and recreational river and/or wildlife refuge which
contains waters that have been classified by the commission as outstanding
basin waters. A regional resources management plan is one that addresses, among
other subjects, the location and general size of allowable wastewater treatment
facilities. A regional resources management plan, or applicable portions
thereof, may be incorporated into the commission's comprehensive
plan. (g) Natural
condition
is the ecological state of a water body that represents
conditions without human influence. (h) Nondischarging/load reduction
options
are options whereby the amount of wastewater discharged to a
surface stream is reduced by (
1
) instituting load reduction
measures involving reductions in pollutants at the source possibly accompanied
by water conservation practices to reduce the amount of flow received at a
wastewater treatment plant; and/or (
2
) using land-based
wastewater disposal whereby treated wastewater effluent is further treated by
percolation and other soil-based processes instead of instream
processes. (i) Natural
wastewater treatment systems
are soil-based, vegetative and/or aquatic
wastewater treatment systems characterized by the use of low energy treatment
processes that use and simulate ""natural"" environmental processes such as
primary and secondary productivity, crop production, wetlands, ponds and
others. (j) Nonpoint
sources
are sources of pollutants carried by surface and subsurface
runoff that are derived from human activities and land use. (k) Cumulative impact
is the
net sum of all individual impacts including all point and nonpoint source
impacts. (l) Boundary
control points
are locations where monitoring and other activities
occur to determine existing water quality, no measurable change, and related
pollution control requirements as applicable. Boundary control points for
outstanding basin waters will generally correspond to federally established
boundaries for national parks, etc. while those for significant resource waters
will generally correspond to the confluence of an intrastate tributary with the
classified interstate water. The locations of boundary and interstate control
points are described in part C of table 1 for the reach between Hancock, NY and
the Delaware Water Gap and in tables 2A and 2B for the reach between the

Delaware Water Gap and Trenton, NJ. (m) Interstate control
points
are general locations used to assess water quality for purposes
of defining and protecting existing water quality. The locations of boundary
and interstate control points are described in part C of table 1 for the reach
between Hancock, NY and the Delaware Water Gap and in tables 2A and 2B for the
reach between the Delaware Water Gap and Trenton, NJ. (n) Growth management plans
are locally developed and adopted plans expressing the social, economic, and
environmental goals and objectives of the local community. A growth management
plan in this context can be one plan, a series of plans, local ordinances, and
other official documents of a municipality. Growth management plans outline the
community's desired growth patterns and related infrastructure. To be
considered in the commission's determination of public interest, growth
management plans must be undergoing active implementation and forming the basis
for local governmental decisions. (o) An
expanding wastewater treatment
project
is a project involving either (1) alterations or additions to
an existing wastewater treatment facility that result in a reviewable project
in accordance with the commission's

Rules of Practice and

Procedure; or (2) a new load or increased flow or loading from an
existing facility that was not included in a NPDES permit or docket effective
on the date of SPW designation. (p) Substantial alterations or additions
are those additions and
alterations resulting in: (1)
a complete
upgrade or modernization of an existing wastewater treatment plant, including
substantial replacement or rehabilitation of the existing wastewater treatment
plant, including substantial replacement or rehabilitation of the existing
wastewater treatment process or major physical structures such as headworks, settling tanks, and biological/chemical treatment and filtration tanks, whether
conducted as a single phase or a multi-phased project or related projects; or
(2)
a new load or increased flow
or loading from an existing facility that was not included in a NPDES permit or
docket effective on the date of SPW designation. Among other projects, modifications made solely to address wet weather flows; and alterations that
are limited to changes in the method of disinfection and/or the addition of
treatment works for nutrient removal are not deemed to be ""Substantial

Alterations or Additions.""
(q) Load
and

Loading
are used interchangeably in these regulations and
refer to the amount of a substance or material, expressed as a weight per unit
time (pounds per day, for example), that is discharged from a
facility. (r) Incremental
load
and
incremental loading
are used interchangeably
in these regulations and refer to the load that is greater than the actual load
discharged by a facility at the time of SPW designation. (s) Best management
practices
are any structural or nonstructural measure designed to
reduce stormwater runoff and resulting nonpoint source loads. (t) Watershed nonpoint source
management plan
is a plan prepared for a watershed that describes the
basis for, and overall control strategy of, a plan for controlling, limiting, and abating all relevant nonpoint source loadings within the watershed. The
plan will identify and assess important natural and anthropogenic features and
influences on water quality; existing local, state and other nonpoint source
control programs; potential nonpoint source loads on special protection waters; watershed-specific protection requirements; and the institutional needs and
arrangements required to implement the plan. (u) Nonpoint source pollution control
plan
is a plan describing the best management practices to be used at
the project site and in the project service area to control increases in
nonpoint source pollutant loadings resulting from the project. (v) Priority watershed
is a
watershed that has been evaluated in conjunction with other watersheds draining
to special protection waters and designated by the commission as having a
substantial potential pollution impact on the water quality of special
protection waters in comparison with other watersheds. (ii)

No measurable change to existing water
quality. (a) Outstanding basin waters shall be
maintained at their existing water quality. Point and nonpoint sources of
pollutants originating from outside the boundaries of stream reaches classified
as outstanding basin waters shall be treated as required and then dispersed in
the receiving water so that no measurable change occurs at boundary and
interstate control points. Point sources of pollutants discharged to
outstanding basin waters shall be treated as required and then dispersed in
such a manner that complete mixing of effluent with the receiving stream is, for all practical intents and purposes, instantaneous. (b) Significant resource waters shall not be
degraded below existing water quality as defined in these regulations, although
localized degradation of water quality may be allowed for initial dilution if
the commission, after consultation with the State NPDES permitting agency, finds that the public interest warrants these changes. Point and nonpoint
sources of pollutants originating from outside the boundaries of stream reaches
classified as significant resource waters shall be treated as required and then
dispersed in the receiving water so that no measurable change occurs at
boundary and interstate control points, unless a mixing zone is allowed in
significant resource waters, and then to the extent of the mixing zone
designated as set forth in this section. If degradation of water quality is
allowed for initial dilution purposes, the commission, after consultation with
the State NPDES permitting agency, will designate mixing zones for each point
source and require the highest possible point source treatment levels necessary
to limit the size and extent of the mixing zones. The dimensions of the mixing
zone will be determined by the commission after consultation with the State
NPDES permitting agency based upon an evaluation of (1) site-specific
conditions, including channel characteristics; (2) the cost and feasibility of
treatment technologies; and (3) the design of the discharge structure. Mixing
zones will be developed using the wastewater treatment facility design
conditions and low ambient flow conditions unless site-specific characteristics
indicate otherwise. Nonpoint sources shall be subject to the requirements of
subparagraph (v) of this paragraph for the implementation of nonpoint source
control plans. (iii)

Allowable discharges. (a) Direct discharges of
wastewater to special protection waters are discouraged. The following
categories of projects discharging directly to special protection waters may be
approved only after the applicant demonstrates that it has fully evaluated all
non-discharge/load reduction alternatives and is unable to implement these
alternatives because of technical and/or financial infeasibility: new
wastewater treatment facilities and substantial alterations or additions to
existing wastewater treatment facilities. When evaluating non-discharge/load
reduction alternatives, the applicant shall consider alternatives to any and
all loadings-both existing and proposed-in excess of actual loadings at the
time of SPW designation. (b) The
following categories of projects within the drainage area of special protection
waters may be approved only after the applicant demonstrates that it has fully
evaluated all natural wastewater treatment system alternatives and is unable to
implement these alternatives because of technical and/or financial
infeasibility: new wastewater treatment facilities and substantial alterations
or additions to existing wastewater treatment facilities. When evaluating
natural treatment alternatives, the applicant shall consider alternatives to
any and all loadings-both existing and proposed-in excess of actual loadings at
the time of SPW designation. (c) The following categories of projects discharging directly to significant
resource waters may be approved only following a determination that the project
is in the public interest as that term is defined in subparagraph (a)(2)(i)(e)
of this paragraph: new wastewater treatment facilities and substantial
alterations or additions to existing wastewater treatment facilities. (d) The general number, location and size of
future wastewater treatment facilities discharging to outstanding basin waters
(if any) shall be developed taking into consideration any adopted regional
resource management plan as defined in clause (i)
(f) of this
paragraph and, on an individual project basis, considering the feasibility of
non-discharge/load reduction alternatives. (iv)

Wastewater treatment facilities. (a) All wastewater treatment facilities
discharging to waters classified as special protection waters shall have
available standby power facilities unless it can be shown that a proposed
discharge can be interrupted for an extended period with no threat to the water
quality of special protection waters. Existing facilities must comply with this
requirement upon their next permit renewal under the delegated national
polluant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit program. (b) All wastewater treatment facilities
discharging to special protection waters that are not staffed 24 hours every
day shall have a remote alarm that will continuously monitor plant operations
whenever the plant is not staffed. The alarm system will be designed to alert
someone available with authority and knowledge to take appropriate action. Existing facilities must comply with this requirement upon their next permit
renewal under the delegated NPDES program. (c) All new wastewater treatment facilities
discharging to outstanding basin waters shall not have visual discharge plumes. Existing facilities must comply with this requirement upon their next permit
renewal under the delegated NPDES program. (d) All new wastewater treatment facilities
discharging to special protection waters shall prepare and implement an
emergency management plan following the guidance provided in the Water

Pollution Control Federation's

Manual of Practice SM-8, Emergency

Planning for Municipal Wastewater Facilities, the U.S. EPA's

Design Criteria for Mechanical, Electric and Fluid System and Component

Reliability
or other suitable manuals. Emergency management plans
shall include an emergency notification procedure covering all affected
downstream users. Existing facilities must comply with this requirement upon
their next permit renewal under the delegated NPDES program. (e) The minimum level of wastewater treatment
for the following categories of projects will be ""Best Demonstrable Technology""
as defined below: all new wastewater treatment facilities and all projects
involving substantial alterations or additions to existing wastewater treatment
facilities when the new or expanding facility discharges directly to
outstanding basin waters or significant resource waters. Equivalent effluent
criteria for industrial facilities and seasonal limits, if any, will be
developed on a case-by-case basis. The following 30-day average effluent
criteria define best demonstrable technology: *
5-day CBOD: 10 mg/l or less

Dissolved oxygen: 6.0 mg/l or greater

Total suspended solids: 10 mg/l or less

Ammonia-nitrogen: 1.5 mg/l or less

Total nitrogen: 10.0 mg/l or less

Total phosphorus: 2.0 mg/l or less

Fecal coliform: 50/100 ml or less
(f) Best demonstrable technology for
disinfection shall be ultraviolet light disinfection or an equivalent
disinfection process that results in no harm to aquatic life, does not produce
toxic chemical residuals, and results in effective bacterial and viral
destruction. (g) For
wastewater treatment facility
discharge projects that satisfy
applicable requirements of subparagraphs (ii) through (iv) of this paragraph, the commission may approve effluent trading on a voluntary basis between point
sources within the same watershed or between the same interstate or boundary
control points to achieve no measurable change to existing water quality. Applicants seeking the commission's approval for a trade must demonstrate
equivalent load and pollutant reductions and the ability (through contracts, docket conditions, NPDES effluent limits or other legal instruments) to ensure
continuous achievement of the required reductions for a term of not less than
five years or the time required for the point source(s) to install the
treatment needed to demonstrate no measurable change to existing water quality, whichever term is longer. States will be encouraged to incorporate appropriate
conditions in the next NPDES permits issued to the trading
dischargers. (h) For wastewater
treatment facilities within the drainage area to special protection waters, the
actual loads and design flows included in a NPDES permit or docket effective at
the time of special protection waters designation (""SPW designation"") may
continue without triggering the additional treatment requirements and
alternatives analyses required by these regulations. However, when substantial
alterations or additions as defined herein are proposed, although the actual
discharge at the time of SPW designation remains exempt from additional
requirements, the proposed expansion cannot be approved until (1) the applicant
demonstrates that it has evaluated all non-discharge load reduction
alternatives for all or a portion of the incremental load and is unable to
implement these alternatives because of technical or financial infeasibility
(for discharges directly to outstanding basin waters [OBW] and significant
resource waters [SRW]); (2) the applicant demonstrates that it has evaluated
all natural wastewater treatment system alternatives for all or a portion of
the incremental load and is unable to implement these alternatives because of
technical or financial infeasibility (for discharges directly to OBW and SRW
and for tributary discharges); (3) the commission has determined that the
project is demonstrably in the public interest as defined herein (for
discharges directly to SRW); (4) the minimum level of treatment to be provided
for the incremental discharge is best demonstrable technology as defined herein
(for discharges directly to OBW and SRW); and (5) the applicant demonstrates
that the project will cause no measurable change to existing water quality as
defined herein (for discharges directly to OBW and SRW and for tributary
discharges). (i) For wastewater
treatment facility projects subject to the no measurable change requirement, the demonstration of no measurable change to existing water quality shall be
satisfied if the applicant demonstrates that the new or incremental increase in
the facility's flow or load will cause no measurable change at the relevant
water quality control point for the parameters denoted by asterisks in tables 1
and 2 of this section: ammonia (NH
3
N); dissolved oxygen
(DO); fecal coliform (FC); nitrate (NO
3
N) or nitrite +
nitrate (NO
2
N + NO
3
N); total
nitrogen (TN) or total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN); total phosphorus (TP); total
suspended solids (TSS); and biological oxygen demand (BOD) (table 1 only). In
making the demonstration required in the preceding sentence the applicant shall
use a DRBC-approved model of the tributary or main stem watershed if available. Where a DRBC-approved model is not available, the applicant shall use other
methodologies submitted to and approved in advance by the commission to
estimate cumulative effect at the applicable control point. (v) Control of nonpoint sources. (a) Projects subject to review under section
3.8
of the Compact that are
located in the drainage area of special protection waters must submit for
approval a nonpoint source pollution control plan that controls the new or
increased nonpoint source loads generated within the portion of the project's
service area which is also located within the drainage area of special
protection waters. The plan will document which best management practices
described in handbooks, manuals and other documents prepared by the applicable
state environmental agency that the project sponsor will use to control, to the
extend possible, the nonpoint source loads from the project. In approving the
plan, the commission may consider, but not require, tradeoffs, that the project
sponsor might propose, between the reduction of potential new nonpoint source
loads and: (1)
equivalent reductions in
existing nonpoint source loads; (2)
equivalent point source loads; and
(3)
equivalent nonpoint source loads from
outside the affected service area. Applicants desiring commission approval of tradeoff
strategies must provide information concerning the amount of nonpoint source
loads to be reduced through an equivalent tradeoff process and, where
necessary, the enforceable mechanisms and/or agreements required to implement
the tradeoffs. Where tradeoffs have been approved, control measures for
existing nonpoint sources must be substantially in-place prior to project
operation. The executive director may, upon agreement with the State, delegate
review and approval responsibilities under this section to the appropriate

State environmental agency. Exceptions to this policy are: (i) Public authorities, other special purpose
districts, and private corporations that do not have the legal authority to
implement nonpoint source controls in their new or expanded service areas. Such
entities are subject, however, to the requirement set forth in clause
(b) of this subparagraph, that no new connection may be
approved unless the area(s) served is (are) regulated by a nonpoint source
pollution control plan approved by the commission. (ii)

The requirement for service area
nonpoint source control plans is automatically satisfied if the project service
area is part of a watershed nonpoint source management plan that has been
adopted into the commission's comprehensive plan and is being
implemented. (iii)

Projects located
above major surface water impoundments listed in subdivision (a)(2)(vii)(e) of
this section where time of travel and relevant hydraulic and limnological
factors preclude a direct impact on special protection waters. (iv)

Projects located in municipalities that
have adopted and are actively implementing nonpoint source/stormwater control
ordinances that have been reviewed and approved by the commission. (v) Projects located in watersheds where the
applicable State environmental agency, county government, and local
municipalities are participating in the development of a watershed plan being
prepared under the auspices of these regulations, the Federal Clean Water Act, or State initiatives. (b) Approval of a new or expanded water
withdrawal and/or wastewater discharge project will be subject to the condition
that any new connection to the project system only serve an area(s) regulated
by a nonpoint source pollution control plan which has been approved by the
commission. (c) Within two years
after the adoption of special protection waters nonpoint source control
regulations, the commission shall, after substantial consultation with local, county, State and Federal agencies and the general public, publish a report
presenting its methodology for prioritizing watersheds in the special
protection waters drainage area including alternatives, if any; a preliminary
listing of priority watersheds in the drainage area; and a recommended plan of
study for the development of watershed-specific management plans. For waters
classified as special protection waters after December 1992, the watershed
prioritization process will be completed within two years after the special
protection waters are classified. Watershed priorities will be determined from
a comparative analysis of each watershed's location and potential, future
impact on existing water quality at designated boundary and interstate control
points. In determining priorities, the commission will consider: (1)
the physical characteristics of the
watershed including slopes, soils, existing land use and land cover, drainage
characteristics, and others; (2)
the status of existing water quality and trends, if any, of the watershed as
measured as its boundary control point; (3)
the anticipated mass loadings of new
nonpoint sources; (4)
the watershed
management and planning priorities of applicable local, State and Federal
agencies; (5)
the current status of
local land use/nonpoint source controls in the watershed; and, (6)
the stormwater permitting activity in the
NPDES permitting program; and
(7)
other natural and anthropogenic factors. (d) Once the public has been given an
opportunity to comment, the commission will adopt a list of priority
watersheds. This listing will be reviewed and modified as necessary on a two
year basis after adoption. (e) Within five years after adopting a list of priority watersheds draining to
special protection waters, the commission shall develop, or encourage the
development of, watershed nonpoint source management plans for each priority
watershed unless new circumstances result in deferring plan completion. Watershed nonpoint source management plans will focus on nonpoint source
loadings, but will consider total loads including both point and nonpoint
sources and their interrelationship where necessary. During plan development, the commission will seek technical assistance from the applicable State
environmental agency and all other applicable Federal, State, county, and local
government units; and will consider direct delegation of plan development (with
concurrence of the State environmental agency) to any county or other
applicable governmental entity desiring to perform the watershed planning
activities on behalf of, or instead of, the commission. Where more than one
political unit shares a watershed, joint plan development arrangements between
the commission and delegated agencies will be developed. (f) Watershed management plans developed by
the commission, or approved by the commission will be incorporated into the
commission's comprehensive plan in accordance with the

Rules of

Practice and Procedure. (g) The commission shall encourage the
voluntary development of watershed management plans for tributary watersheds
entering special protection waters and local nonpoint source regulatory
programs that conform to the goals and objectives of the special protection
waters regulations as promulgated in subdivision (a)(2) of this section. Within
the limits of its resources, the commission will provide technical assistance, a clearinghouse for nonpoint sources information, regulatory authority, inter-agency coordination, and other services to local and other governmental
units desiring to develop and implement stormwater and nonpoint source
watershed plans and local regulatory programs. (h) The commission shall encourage the
submission of watershed management plans prepared voluntarily and independently
from these regulations for consideration of inclusion into the commission's
comprehensive plan. (vi)

Policies regarding intergovernment responsibilities. (a) Inter-relationship of State and
commission responsibilities. The applicable State environmental agency shall
assure to the extent possible that existing water quality in special protection
waters is not measurably changed by pollution discharged into the intrastate
tributary watersheds within its jurisdiction. For water quality management
purposes, the State environmental agency and the commission will jointly
establish boundary control points as described in subparagraph
(i) (l) and (vii)
(d) of this paragraph. In
performing this responsibility, the State environmental agency shall require
that all new or expanding wastewater treatment facilities and existing
wastewater treatment plants applying for a discharge permit or permit renewal
under the delegated NPDES program to comply with the policies as prescribed in
subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph unless it can be demonstrated, after
consultation with the commission, that these requirements are not necessary for
the protection of existing water quality in the special protection waters due
to distance from special protection waters, time of travel, the existence of
water storage impoundments, the waste assimilation characteristics of the
receiving stream, and other relevant hydrological and limnological factors. The
commission shall, to the extent practicable and necessary, coordinate and
oversee all special protection waters activities and assist the efforts of each

State environmental agency to control pollutants originating from intrastate
tributary watersheds. The commission shall determine pollution control
requirements for discharges to special protection waters; for nonpoint sources
draining directly into special protection waters; and total nonpoint source
loads emanating from intrastate tributary watersheds as measured at boundary
control points. (vii)

Classified special protection waters. (a) The
following stream reaches are classified as outstanding basin waters: (1)
the Upper Delaware Scenic and

Recreational River (Delaware River between River Mile 330.7 and
258.4); (2)
those portions of
intrastate tributaries located within the established boundary of the Upper

Delaware Scenic and Recreational River Corridor; (3)
the Middle Delaware Scenic and

Recreational River (Delaware River between River Miles 250.1 and
209.5); (4)
those portions of
tributaries located within the established boundary of the Delaware Water Gap

National Recreation Area. (b) The following stream reaches are
classified as significant resource waters: (1)

The Delaware River between River Miles
258.4 (the downstream boundary of the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational

River) and 250.1 (the upstream boundary of the Delaware Water Gap National

Recreation Area). (2)

The Lower

Delaware River between River Miles 209.5 (the downstream boundary of the

Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area) and 134.34 (the Calhoun Street

Bridge near the Head of Tide at Trenton, NJ). (c) Definitions of existing water quality for
waters classified in subclauses
(1)
and
(2)
of this clause above are presented in part A of table 1 for the Upper Delaware

Scenic & Recreational River and part B of table 1 for the reach from

Millrift, PA. to the Delaware Water Gap, including the Middle Delaware Scenic
and Recreational River; and in table 2 for the reach between the Delaware Water

Gap and Trenton, NJ. (d) The
location of boundary and interstate control points are described in part C of
table 1 for the reach between Hancock, NY and the Delaware Water Gap and in
table 2 for the reach between the Delaware Water Gap and Trenton, NJ. TABLE 1 DEFINITION OF EXISTING WATER QUALITY IN THE

The numeric values for
existing water quality set forth in parts A, B and C of table 1 were developed
through field measurements and laboratory analysis of data collected over a
time period determined by the Commission to adequately reflect the natural
range of the hydraulic and climatologic factors that affect water quality. Existing water quality is defined in terms of (a) an annual or seasonal mean of
the available water quality data, (b) two-tailed upper and lower 95 percent
confidence limits around the mean, and (c) the 10th and 90th percentiles of the
data set from which the mean was calculated. PART B: DELAWARE RIVER FROM

The definitions of Existing

Water Quality presented in Parts A and B of this table were developed by
performing parametric statistical analyses using logarithmic transformation of
available water quality data to derive normality. The numbers represent the
anti-log of the statistical results and, thus, will differ from numbers
generated by using non-transformed data. Means derived from log
transformations, for example, will be lower than means derived from
non-transformed data. The three indices used to develop the biocriteria were
derived from specialized transformations of the original data, resulting in
values that are normally distributed. PART C: BOUNDARY AND INTERSTATE

The waters of the
basin shall not contain substances attributable to municipal, industrial, or
other discharges in concentrations or amounts sufficient to preclude the
specified water uses to be protected. Within this requirement: (i) the waters shall be substantially free
from unsightly or malodorous nuisances due to floating solids, sludge deposits, debris, oil, scum, substances in concentrations or combinations which are toxic
or harmful to human, animal, plant, or aquatic life, or that produce color, taste, odor of the water, or taint fish or shellfish flesh; and
(ii)
the concentration of total dissolved
solids, except intermittent streams, shall not exceed 133 percent of
background. (2)

In no
case shall concentrations of substances exceed those values given for rejection
of water supplies in the

United States Public Health Service Drinking

Water Standards. (c) Aquatic life objectives for toxic
pollutants. It is the policy of the commission to designate numerical
stream quality objectives for the protection of aquatic life for the Delaware

River estuary and Bay (zones 2 through 6) which correspond to the designated
uses of each zone. Aquatic life objectives for the protection from both acute
and chronic effects are herein established on a pollutant-specific basis for: pollutants listed as toxic under section 307(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act for
which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published final
criteria; other chemicals for which EPA has published final criteria under
section 304(a) of the Act; and pollutants and other chemicals in combinations. Other toxic substances for which any of the three estuary states have adopted
criteria or standards may also be considered for the development of stream
quality objectives. (1)

For the
purpose of determining compliance with stream quality objectives for the
protection of aquatic life, the duration of exposure of aquatic organisms shall
be one hour for acute objectives and four days for chronic
objectives. (2)

Stream quality
objectives for cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver and zinc shall
be expressed as the dissolved form of the metal. Adjustment factors established
by the commission based upon the best available scientific information shall be
used to convert total recoverable criteria published by the U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency to dissolved stream quality objectives. In the absence of
data to develop a factor for any of the metals, an adjustment factor of 1.0
shall be utilized. Stream quality objectives for other metals shall be
expressed as the concentration of the total recoverable form of the
metal. (d) Human
health objectives for toxic pollutants. It is the policy of the commission to designate numerical
stream quality objectives for the protection of human health for the Delaware

River estuary and Bay (zones 2 through 6) which correspond to the designated
uses of each zone. Stream quality objectives for protection from both
carcinogenic and systemic effects are herein established on a
pollutant-specific basis for: pollutants listed as toxic under section
307(a)(1) and other toxic pollutants; and other chemicals for which EPA has
published final criteria under section 304(a) of the Act. Other toxic
substances for which any of the three estuary states have adopted criteria or
standards may also be considered for the development of stream quality
objectives. (1)

An objective to
protect against carcinogenic effects shall only be established if the pollutant
is classified A, B or C under the U.S. EPA classification system for
carcinogens, and if a cancer potency factor (CPF) exists in IRIS. (2)

An objective to protect against systemic
effects shall only be established for a pollutant if a reference dose (RfD)
exists in IRIS. An additional safety factor of 10 shall be utilized in
establishing the stream quality objectives to protect against systemic effects
for pollutants classified as carcinogens if a CPF is not available in
IRIS. (3)

In the absence of
toxicological data for an RfD or CPF in IRIS, data published in the 1980 U.S. EPA water quality criteria documents will be considered. (4)

In establishing stream quality objectives
for carcinogens, the level of risk is established at
10
-6
or one additional cancer in every 1,000,000
humans exposed for a lifetime (70 years). (5)

For the purpose of determining compliance
with human health stream quality objectives, the duration of exposure shall be
70 years for carcinogens and 30 days for systemic toxicants. (6)
A rate of ingestion of water of 2.0
liters per day is assumed in calculating objectives for river zones where the
designated uses include public water supplies after reasonable treatment. A
rate of ingestion of fish of 17.5 grams per day (equivalent to consuming a 1/2
pound portion every 13 days) is assumed in calculating freshwater and marine
stream quality objectives for the protection of human health. (7)

Maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) shall
be applied as stream quality objectives in zones 2 and 3 which are designated
for use as public water supplies for those toxic pollutants where the MCL value
is more stringent than the calculated human health objectives for carcinogens
or systemic toxicants. (8)

Numerical criteria for toxic pollutants to protect the taste and odor of
ingested water and fish shall be applied as stream quality objectives in the
zones 2-6 if these criteria are more stringent than the calculated human health
objectives for carcinogens or systemic toxicants. Footnotes
* River mile 209.5 is the downstream boundary of the

Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. SPW waters upstream of and
including this point received SPW designation in 1992 and SPW waters below this
point received SPW designation in 2005. The water quality strategy used to
support this later designation differed from that employed a decade
earlier. * The effluent criteria that define best demonstrable
technology (BDT) were established by these regulations in 1992 when DRBC
originally promulgated the special protection waters regulations for point
source discharges. Although treatment technologies have advanced since that
year, these ""BDT"" criteria have been retained for the limited purposes of the
SPW program. BDT as defined herein may be superseded, however, by applicable

Federal, State or DRBC criteria that are more stringent. Notes

Y. (b) [Definitions.]
(1)

The term well wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to any of the wells now used as a source of this public water supply or to any additional well which may be constructed at this point for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)

Wherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a well is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the well. (c) Privies adjacent to any well. (1)

No privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind placed or used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any well of the public water supply of the North Fork Water Company, Inc. (2)

Every privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for the temporary storage of human excreta, located between the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be arranged in such a manner that all excreta shall be received in a suitable watertight receptacle or removable container which shall be emptied as set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision. (4)

Whenever the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers become filled within six inches of the top, said receptacles or containers shall be emptied or removed and the contents disposed of as hereinafter provided in order to maintain the privy or receptacle in proper sanitary condition and effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transported from the privy or receptacle to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents or the removable containers, while being transported, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)

Unless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits and covered with not less than 12 inches of soil in such a manner as effectually to prevent their being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance of not less than 500 feet from any well of the public water supply of the North Fork Water Company, Inc.

Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 681.14 - Rate setting for intermediate care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities (ICF/DD)

State Regulations
(a) Rates of
reimbursement for intermediate care facilities for persons with developmental
disabilities (ICF/DD), other than those operated by OPWDD, shall be determined
in accordance with Title 10 NYCRR Part
86
-
11. The rates of payment made for
services rendered to title XIX recipients established in accordance with the
methodology contained in 10 NYCRR Part
86
-
11
shall be contingent upon Federal
financial participation (FFP) and approval. (b) Reporting requirements. Each provider shall submit reports in accordance with the
requirements of Subpart 635-4 of this Title. (c) Rate setting. (1)

Units of service. (i) A unit of service is the unit of measure
denoting lodging and services rendered to one individual between the
census-taking hours of the facility on two successive days; the day of
admission but not the day of discharge shall be counted. One unit of service
shall be counted if the individual is discharged on the same day the consumer
is admitted, providing there was an expectation that the admission would have
at least a 24-hour duration. (ii)

Reserve bed days determined in accordance with subdivision (i) of this section
and 18 NYCRR
505.9
are units of service. (2)

Rate cycle. (i) For facilities of over 30 beds, the rate
cycle is comprised of two 12-month rate periods. (ii)

For facilities of under 31 beds, the
rate cycle is comprised of a base period and a subsequent period or periods. (a) The base period is the first 12-month
period of the rate cycle. (1)

The base period
is from January 1st to December 31st for Region II or III facilities. The first
base period begins January 1, 1988 for over 30-bed Region II or III facilities. The base period begins January 1, 2003 for under 31-bed Region II or III
facilities. (2)

The base period is
from July 1st to June 30th for Region I facilities. The first base period
begins July 1, 1988 for over 30-bed Region I facilities. The base period begins

July 1, 2003 for under 31-bed Region I facilities. (b) The subsequent period for over 30-bed
facilities is the second 12-month period of the rate cycle. The subsequent
periods for under 31-bed facilities are the subsequent 12-month periods. (1)

The subsequent period is from January 1st
to December 31st for Region II or III facilities. The first subsequent period
begins January 1, 1989 for over 30-bed Region II or III facilities. The first
subsequent period begins January 1, 2004 for under 31-bed Region II or III
facilities. (2)

The subsequent
period is from July 1st to June 30th for Region I facilities. The first
subsequent period begins July 1, 1989 for over 30-bed Region I facilities. The
first subsequent period begins July 1, 2004 for under 31-bed Region I
facilities. (3)

Computation of rates (general). (i) All rates shall not be final unless
approved by the Director of the Division of the Budget. (ii)

The commissioner may make adjustments to
rates calculated in accordance with this section based upon the allowability of
costs as determined by subdivision (f) of this section and Subpart 635-4 of
this Title. In addition, costs may be reallocated and adjusted following a desk
audit of cost reports. The desk audit will examine the allocation of costs and
OPWDD will reallocate unidentified and improperly classified costs, if any, to
appropriate costs categories. (iii)

The commissioner may also make adjustments to rates calculated in accordance
with subdivision (f) of this section, and Subpart 635-4 of this Title based on
errors which occurred in the computation of the rate. A provider may request a
rate revision based on rate computation errors by notifying OPWDD by certified
mail, return receipt requested, either within 90 days of the provider receiving
the rate computation or within 90 days of the beginning of the rate period in
question, whichever is later. However, if the requested rate revision is
related to the resubmission of an annual cost report, OPWDD shall not accept
the request. The commissioner may also adjust for changes in certified
capacity, changes in payments for real property which have the prior approval
of the commissioner and the Director of the Division of the Budget, or changes
based upon previously determined final audit findings. If a facility has
undergone a change in certified capacity, the commissioner may: (a) request the facility to submit a budget
report subject to Subpart 635-4 of this Title; (b) request the facility to submit
incremental/decremental cost data which is associated with the capacity change. Utilizing the submitted incremental/decremental data or
budget report, OPWDD shall make the appropriate upward or downward adjustment
in a facility's rate; or continue the then existing rate for the remainder of
the subject rate period in those instances where the commissioner has
determined that the facility is operating at a loss for the rate period in
question and adjusting the current rate would further increase such loss, or
the facility is operating at a surplus for the rate period in question and
adjusting the rate would further increase such surplus. (iv)

Rate adjustments as described
in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph will be limited to those adjustments
which will result in an annual increase or decrease in reimbursement of $5,000
or more. (v) Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this section, for over 30-bed facilities the reimbursable
operating costs contained in the rates shall be computed as follows. OPWDD
shall determine the total reimbursable operating costs (with the exception of
education and related service costs, sheltered workshop services, and day
training services) included in the payment rate in effect on December 31st or

June 30th, of the immediately preceding rate period applicable to that
facility. The dollars for sheltered workshop, day program services identified
in clause (4)(viii)(
e
) of this subdivision and day training
services shall be revised based upon the number of individuals participating in
the program. The reimbursable operating cost plus any revised sheltered work
and day training costs will be increased by the trend factor identified in
subdivision (h) of this section and may be adjusted for appropriate appeals, except that day program services costs identified in clause
(4)(viii)(
e
) of this subdivision are not subject to the trend
factors identified in subdivision (h) of this section, but will be increased by
the trend factors used by OPWDD for day services similar to those paid for
through the add-on described in clause (4)(viii)(
e
) of this
subdivision. Education and related services will be updated in accordance with
clause (4)(ix)(
c
) of this subdivision. To determine the
capital cost portion of the subsequent period rate, OPWDD shall review the
component relating to capital costs for substantial material changes and, if
said changes conform to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) and (3) of this
section and Subpart 635-4 of this Title, make corresponding adjustments in
computing the subsequent period rate. (vi)

The computation of the rate resulting
from the application of this paragraph can also be represented by the following
formula: (a) trended reimbursable operating
costs + untrended reimbursable operating costs + reimbursable capital costs
equal total reimbursable costs; (b) total reimbursable costs / units of service = the rate. (vii)

If OPWDD is unable to compute a rate
for a newly certified facility, it may establish an interim rate which shall be
the regional average for other facilities. (a) OPWDD shall replace the interim rate
retroactively to the starting date of such interim rate by a rate developed
from the initial budget report submitted by the facility. (b) The rate developed from the initial
budget report shall be subject to all the requirements of this section, and
shall be effective for the remainder of the then current rate period. (viii)

Providers shall be
responsible for any necessary transportation to and from physician, dentist, and other clinical services, and any other transportation appropriate to the
individual's participation in community-based out-of-residence activities
planned for or sponsored by the facility. Nothing herein shall be interpreted
as precluding the accessing of separate Medicaid claiming for
emergency/nonemergency ambulance services (as defined in 18 NYCRR
505.10
)
necessitated by the individual's medical condition. (4)

Computation of the base period. (i) For each facility the commissioner shall
establish rates in accordance with the certified capacity as stated in a
facility's provider agreement. (ii)

Base period rates for over 30-bed facilities shall be computed on the basis of
a full 12-month cost report submitted by the provider for the 12-month period
beginning 24 months prior to the effective date of the base period, and subject
to the cost category screens described herein. For a newly certified over
30-bed facility, OPWDD shall use budget data, as submitted pursuant to Subpart
635-4 of this Title. (iii)

The base
period rate for under 31-bed Region 11 and III facilities shall be computed on
the basis of a full 12-month base year cost report submitted by the provider
for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1999 and adjusted in accordance
with subparagraph (3)(ii) of this subdivision. The base period rate for under
31-bed Region I facilities shall be computed on the basis of a full 12-month
base year cost report submitted by the provider for the 12-month period
beginning July 1, 1999 and adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (3)(ii) of
this subdivision. For a newly certified under 31-bed facility, OPWDD shall use
the budget data submitted pursuant to Subpart 635-4 of this Title. (iv)

For a newly certified facility, the base
period rate shall be determined pursuant to subparagraph (vii) of this
paragraph. For under 31-bed facilities the units of service are determined by
multiplying the certified capacity of the facility by 365 days. For over 30-bed
facilities, units of service are the certified capacity of the facility
multiplied by 365 days multiplied by 99 percent. A facility's submitted budget
costs may be adjusted based on a comparison to the actual costs of other
existing facilities operated by the provider in order to determine the costs of
an efficient and economic operation. If the provider does not operate other
facilities, the submitted budget costs may be adjusted based on a comparison to
the average costs of other facilities in the same region. (v) For facilities which are not newly
certified facilities, the base period rate shall be determined pursuant to
subparagraph (vii) of this paragraph. For under 31-bed facilities, the units of
service are determined by multiplying the certified capacity of the facility by
365 days. For over 30-bed facilities, units of service are the higher of the
certified capacity of the facility multiplied by 365 days multiplied by 99
percent, or the actual reported units of service. (vi)

As appropriate, OPWDD shall apply trend
factors to each facility's reimbursable operating costs, except for education
and related services. However, day program services costs identified in clause
(viii)(
e
) of this paragraph are not subject to the trend
factors identified in subdivision (h) of this section, but will be increased by
the trend factors used by OPWDD for day services similar to those paid for
through the add-on described in clause (viii)(
e
) of this
paragraph. (vii)

The computation of
the rate resulting from the application of this paragraph can also be
represented by the following formula: (a) trended reimbursable operating costs + untrended reimbursable operating costs +
reimbursable capital costs = total reimbursable costs; (b) total reimbursable costs / units of
service = the rate. (viii)

For all facilities there shall be a
day program services add-on so that facilities which have day program services
included in their rate shall be reimbursed as follows for these services. The
add-on shall reflect services needs as well as efficiency and economy of
operation. (a) For sheltered workshop
services, effective July 1, 1995, the facility will receive a reimbursable cost
of $9,899 per annum for each program participant. For program participants to
whom the conditions set forth in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph apply, the
facility will receive a reimbursable cost of $9,499 per annum for each program
participant. (b) For day training
programs, effective July 1, 1995, the facility will be reimbursed $11,033 per
annum for each program participant. For program participants to whom the
conditions set forth in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph apply, the facility
will be reimbursed $10,633 per annum for each program participant. (c) If an agency applies to OPWDD prior to

January 1, 2003, and for participants receiving services in day training
facilities where the developmental disability profile average score for the
site exceeds 348 for the adaptive score and exceeds 10 for the health score, the amount of the add-on shall be determined by a budget review. The amount of
the add-on received by the ICF/DD for such day training services shall reflect
individual service needs as well as efficiency and economy of service
provision. Effective January 1, 2003, for any facility to which this subclause
applies, the add-on shall be equal to the reimbursement that was in the
facility's rate on December 31, 2002, and that was applicable to day training
services described in this subclause. (d) The costs of day program services
delivered in a certified day treatment facility (see Part 690 of this Title)
may not be included as an add-on to the ICF/DD rate. (e) Effective January 1, 2003, a provider may
request that a day program services add-on be included in the facility's rate. The day program services add-on for all day program services shall be either
the day program services reimbursement included in the rate on December 31, 2002 and adjusted for actual service delivery; or the lower of: (1)
the actual costs per the most recent cost
report accepted by OPWDD net of any surplus calculated for the day program
services; or
(2)
the budget
costs; (3)
the costs in subclauses
(
1
) and (
2
) of this clause are subject to a
desk audit. Administrative review of these desk audits shall be in accordance
with section
635-4.6
(h) of
this Title. (f) Effective June 1, 1995, the facility will be reimbursed for education and
related services in accordance with Title 8 NYCRR. These costs shall not be
trended. (ix)

Effective

July 1, 1997 an under 31-bed facility may submit to the commissioner a request
for a transportation add-on for transportation of persons to and from an
outpatient service certified pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law
for certain persons if: (a) in order to meet
a person's active treatment needs the person's individual program plan requires
a day service (comprising regular attendance at a sheltered workshop or a day
training service) in combination with visits to the outpatient service
described above; (b) prior to July
1, 1996, transportation to and from the outpatient service was not included in
the rate for the operator of the outpatient service; (c) prior to July 1, 1996, the rate approved
by the local social services district was billed separately by a transportation
vendor for transportation to and from the outpatient service; and
(d) the vendor ceased billing for
transportation of persons residing in the facility to and from the outpatient
service. (x) The
transportation add-on shall be a reimbursable cost added to a facility's rate
subject to the conditions set forth in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph. The
transportation add-on shall be calculated using payment/rate data based on
local social service district approved Medicaid payment rates made to
transportation vendors as of June 30, 1996. A weighted transportation average
shall be calculated for each facility by dividing the aggregate transportation
payments by the aggregate day service transportation round trips for all
persons described in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph. (a) The weighted transportation average for
each facility shall be ranked among all day treatment facilities statewide
pursuant to the methodology for calculating the transportation component add-on
for day treatment facilities described in section
690.7
(e)(3)(vii)
(
a
)(
1
) through and including
(
a
)(
3
) of this Title. (b) The modified weighted transportation
average shall be multiplied by the total to and from day service transportation
units of service to determine reimbursable transportation costs. (xi)

Effective September 1, 2011, the rate shall be adjusted for providers with ICF/DD populations that include
individuals who are Willowbrook class members and who are accessing Willowbrook
case services delivered by a non-state provider. (a) The add-on to the rate shall be
predicated on the number of Willowbrook class members accessing Willowbrook
case services delivered by a service coordinator who is qualified to provide

Medicaid service coordination (see Subpart 635-5 of this Title), Willowbrook
case services are those case management services required by appendix I of the
permanent injunction ordered by the United States District Court of the Eastern

District of New York on March 11, 1993 in the case of

New York State

Association for Retarded Children
v. Cuomo, that
exceed the case management services delivered by the QIDP in the
ICF/DD. (b) The amount of the
additional reimbursement per provider on an annual basis shall be equal to the
sum of the months in which each Willowbrook class member residing in any of the
provider's ICF/DDs receives Willowbrook case services over the span of the
ICF/DD provider's accounting/reporting year multiplied by one half of the

Medicaid service coordination fee established for Willowbrook class members as
identified in the Medicaid service coordination contract for providers of that
service. (5)

Computation of the subsequent period rate. (i) The reimbursable operating costs
contained in the subsequent period rates shall be computed as follows. OPWDD
shall determine the total reimbursable operating costs (with the exception of
education and related service costs, sheltered workshop services, day training
services) included in the payment rate in effect on December 31st or June 30th
of the immediately preceding rate period applicable to that facility. The
dollars for sheltered workshop and day training services shall be revised based
upon the number of individuals participating in the program. The reimbursable
operating costs plus any revised sheltered work and day training costs will be
increased by the trend factor identified in subdivision (h) of this section and
may be adjusted for appropriate appeals, except that day program services costs
identified in clause (4)(viii)(
e
) of this subdivision are not
subject to the trend factors identified in subdivision (h) of this section, but
will be increased by the trend factors used by OPWDD for day services similar
to those paid for through the add-on described in clause
(4)(viii)(
e
) of this subdivision. Education and related
services will be updated in accordance with clause (4)(ix)(
c
)
of this subdivision. OPWDD will determine the capital cost portion of the
subsequent period rate by reviewing the component relating to capital costs for
substantial material changes. If such changes conform to the requirements of
paragraphs (f)(1) and (3) of this section and Subpart 635-6 of this Title, OPWDD will make corresponding adjustments in computing the subsequent period
rate. (ii)

The computation of the
rate resulting from the application of this paragraph can also be represented
by the following formula: (a) trended
reimbursable operating costs + untrended reimbursable operating costs +
reimbursable capital costs = total reimbursable costs; (b) total reimbursable costs/units of service
= the rate. (iii)

For a
newly certified facility which begins to provide services that fall within a
subsequent period, the initial rate shall be calculated as though it were a
base period rate. (d) Cost category screens, reimbursement for
under 31-bed facilities, and July 1, 2011 consolidation. In order to determine
the reimbursable operating costs to be included in the rate calculation, the
following screens (
i.e., the maximum amount that will be
allowed for a specific item or group of items) will be used. The regional
screens corresponding to the actual geographic location of the facility will be
applied. (1)

Administration screens and
reimbursement. (i) Screens. (a) Administrative screen values shall be
equal to the sum of the total reimbursable administrative costs and the total
reimbursable administrative fringe benefits, less the value of the efficiency
adjustment, included in the rate effective on the last day of the immediately
preceding rate period. This amount shall be detrended to the base
year. (b) For facilities without a
screen as determined in clause (
a
) of this subparagraph, operated by a provider which does operate other facilities, an agency
administrative percentage based on the current reimbursement of those other
facilities shall be applied. (c) For facilities without a screen as determined in clauses (
a
)
and (
b
) of this subparagraph, operated by a provider which
operates other OPWDD certified residential programs, an agency administrative
percentage based on the current reimbursement of the other OPWDD certified
residential programs shall be applied. (d) For facilities without a screen as
determined in clauses (
a
)-(
c
) of this
subparagraph, operated by a provider which does not operate any other OPWDD
certified residential programs, a regional average administrative percentage
based on the current reimbursement of facilities operated by other providers
shall be applied. (e) For
facilities without a screen value as determined per clause (
a
)
of this subparagraph, the administrative screen value shall be equal to the
percentages derived from clause (
b
), (
c
) or
(
d
) of this subparagraph times the reimbursable operating
costs other than administration. This value shall be detrended to the base
year. (ii)

Reimbursable
administration costs shall be the lesser of administrative base year
costs/budget costs, or the screen value as determined in subparagraph (i) of
this paragraph. Effective July 1, 2011, for providers in all regions, rates
shall be revised such that reimbursable administration costs shall be the
lesser of: (a) administrative costs as
reported in the provider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I providers or 2008
cost report for Regions II and III providers detrended to the 1999/1999-2000
base year or administrative budget costs detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base
year; or
(b) 85 percent of the
screen value as determined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (2)

Direct care screens
and reimbursement. (i) Screen. The direct
care screen value shall be the direct care FTEs multiplied by the regional
salary. (a) Direct care FTEs shall be
calculated utilizing the facility specific disability increment plus bed size
increment. The term
disability increment
shall mean the
process of developing facility specific direct care FTEs based upon aggregate
consumer disability characteristics as referenced and described in section
690.7
(d) of this

Title and reported on the developmental disabilities profile (DDP). The
disability increment methodology will only be calculated if at least 50 percent
of the DDP scores are available. If less than 50 percent of the DDP scores are
available, the direct care FTEs calculated shall be based upon bed size
increment alone. The disability increment using the DDP scores is calculated as
follows: 0.063 FTEs times the facility mean direct care score plus 0.008 FTEs
time the facility mean behavior score plus 0.062 FTEs times the facility
standard deviation direct care score minus 0.019 FTEs times the facility
standard deviation behavior score. The direct score is computed for each
consumer from the DDP adaptive and health/medical scores as follows: 7.962 plus
0.156 times the adaptive score plus 1.611 times the health/medial score. The
bed size increments are as follows: Bed size

reimbursable direct care costs shall be the lesser of: (a) direct care costs as reported in the
provider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I providers or 2008 cost report for

Regions II and III providers detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year or

screen values established in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Effective July
1, 2011, for providers in all Regions, rates shall be revised such that
reimbursable support personal service costs shall be the lesser of: (a) support personal service costs as
reported in the provider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I providers or 2008
cost report for Regions II and III providers detrended to the 1999/1999-2000
base year or support personal service budget costs detrended to the
1999/1999-2000 base year; or

Note: The above values are in base year dollars. (ii)

Rates prior to July 1, 2011. (a) For newly certified facilities, that have
a rate effective on the last day of the immediately preceding rate period, the
reimbursable clinical costs will be the clinical FTEs approved and reimbursed
in the rate effective on the last day of the immediately preceding rate period
multiplied by the lesser of: (1)
the clinical
average salary reimbursed in the rate on the last day of the immediately
preceding rate period detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year; or
(2)
the appropriate clinical regional salary
listed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (b) For newly certified facilities, that do
not have a rate effective on the last day of the immediately preceding rate
period, OPWDD will consider budgeted FTEs and average salaries, reviewed and
adjusted if necessary through a desk audit process. The reimbursable clinical
costs shall be the desk-audited budgeted clinical FTEs multiplied by the lesser
of: (1)
the desk-audited budgeted clinical
average salary, detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year; or
(2)
the appropriate regional clinical salary
listed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (c) For facilities which are not newly
certified, the reimbursable clinical costs shall be the base year cost report
clinical FTEs multiplied by the lesser of: (1)
the base year cost report clinical
average salary; or
(2)
the
appropriate regional clinical salary listed in subparagraph (i) of this
paragraph. (iii)

Rates effective July 1, 2011. (a) For Region I providers that do not have a
2008-2009 cost report but that operate an under 31-bed ICF/DD(s) that has
(have) a rate in effect on June 30, 2011, or for Regions II and III providers
that do not have a 2008 cost report but that operate an under 31-bed ICF/DD(s)
that has (have) a rate in effect on June 30, 2011, the reimbursable clinical
costs will be the clinical component of the June 30, 2011 rate(s) detrended to
the 1999/1999-2000 base year. (b) For facilities that do not have a rate in effect on June 30, 2011, OPWDD shall
use the budgeted FTEs and budgeted average salaries, reviewed and adjusted if
necessary through a desk audit process. The reimbursable clinical costs for
such facilities shall be the desk-audited budgeted clinical FTEs multiplied by
the lesser of: (1)
the desk-audited budgeted
clinical average salary, detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year; or
(2)
the appropriate regional
clinical salary listed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (c) For Region I providers that
have a 2008-2009 cost report or for Region II or III providers that have a 2008
cost report, the reimbursable clinical costs shall be the FTEs from the
provider's cost report multiplied by the lesser of: (1)
the clinical average salary as reported
in the provider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I providers or 2008 cost
report for Regions II and III providers detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base
year; or
(2)
the appropriate
regional clinical salary listed in subparagraph (i) of this
paragraph. (5)

Fringe benefit screens and reimbursement. (i) Rates prior to July 1, 2011. (a) For every new rate cycle, OPWDD shall
compute a facility-specific fringe benefit percentage. This percentage shall be
determined by summing the direct care, clinical and support fringe benefit
costs from the base year budget or cost report and dividing this sum by the sum
of direct care, clinical and support personal service costs (exclusive of
contracted personal service) from the base year budget or cost
report. (b) For newly certified
facilities, that have a rate effective on the last day of the immediately
preceding rate period, the fringe benefit percentage screen shall equal the
fringe benefit percentage contained in the rate effective on the last day of
the immediately preceding rate period. (c) For newly certified facilities, that do
not have a rate effective on the last day of the immediately preceding rate
period, the fringe benefit percentage screen (as calculated in subparagraph [i]
of this paragraph) shall equal the average percentage reimbursed to existing
facilities currently operated by the provider. If there are no existing
facilities, then the fringe benefit percentage screen shall equal the average
reimbursed fringe benefit percentage of any other programs operated by the
provider. If the provider does not operate any other programs, then the fringe
benefit percentage screen shall equal the regional average percentage
reimbursed to other facilities. (d) Reimbursable fringe benefit costs shall be equal to the computed fringe benefit
percentage established in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph
multiplied by the reimbursable direct care, clinical and support personal
service dollars, exclusive of contracted personal service. (ii)

Effective July 1, 2011. (a) OPWDD shall compute a facility-specific
fringe benefit percentage by summing a facility's direct care, clinical and
support fringe benefit costs detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year and
dividing this sum by the sum of direct care, clinical and support personal
service costs (exclusive of contracted personal service) detrended to the
1999/1999-2000 base year: (1)
for Region I
providers that have a 2008-2009 cost report or for Regions II and III providers
that have a 2008 cost report, for facilities that are in the cost report, the
direct care, clinical, and support fringe benefit costs and direct care, clinical, and support personal service costs shall be those costs reported by
the providers in their cost reports; and/or
(2)
for facilities that opened after the
beginning of the provider's respective reporting period as described in
subclause (
1
) of this clause but that have a rate in effect on

June 30, 2011, the direct care, clinical, and support fringe benefit costs and
direct care, clinical, and support personal service costs shall be those costs
reflected in the provider's site-specific rates in effect on June 30, 2011; and/or
(3)

For facilities that do
not have a rate in effect on June 30, 2011, the fringe benefit percentage shall
equal the average percentage reimbursed to existing facilities currently
operated by the provider. If there are no existing facilities, then the fringe
benefit percentage shall equal the average reimbursed fringe benefit percentage
of any other programs operated by the provider. If the provider does not
operate any other programs, then the fringe benefit percentage shall equal the
regional average percentage reimbursed to other facilities. (b) Reimbursable fringe benefit
costs shall be equal to the computed fringe benefit percentage established
pursuant to clause (
a
) of this subparagraph multiplied by the
reimbursable direct care, clinical and support personal service dollars, exclusive of contracted personal service. (6)

Support OTPS (other than personal
service) screens and reimbursement. (i) The
facility's support OTPS screen is determined by multiplying the certified
capacity by the appropriate regional per bed value. (ii)

Support OTPS regional per bed values. Region
I
$16,097
II
13,085
III
16,418

Note: The above values are in base year dollars. (iii)

Reimbursable support OTPS costs shall
be the lesser of the base year costs/budget costs, or the screen values
established in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Effective July 1, 2011, for
providers in all regions, rates shall be revised such that reimbursable support
OTPS shall be the lesser of: (a) support OTPS
costs as reported in the provider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I
providers or 2008 cost report for Regions II and III providers detrended to the
1999/1999-2000 base year or support OTPS budget costs detrended to the
1999/1999-2000 base year; or
(b) the screen value as determined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (7)

Utility costs will
not be included within the support OTPS screen. Prior to July 1, 2011, reimbursable utility costs shall be the base year costs or budget costs. Effective July 1, 2011, the reimbursable utility costs shall be the 2008-2009
costs for Region I providers or the 2008 costs for Regions II and III providers
detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year or the budget costs detrended to the
1999/1999-2000 base year. (8)

Effective July 1, 2011. Consolidation of site-specific rates into a single rate
applicable to all facilities operated by a provider. (i) Site-specific rates shall be revised to
effect new July 1, 2011, rates in accordance with the processes outlined in
this subdivision. OPWDD shall then consolidate the site-specific rates for each
provider to produce a single rate for all facilities operated by a provider
according to the steps outlined as follows: (a) For each provider, the individual cost
categories total reimbursable costs contained in the site-specific rates in
effect on July 1, 2011 for each site operated by that provider shall be
summed. (b) For each provider, the
individual certified capacities upon which the site-specific rates in effect on

July 1, 2011 are predicated for each site operated by that provider shall be
summed. (c) For each provider, the
individual potential maximum client days upon which the site-specific rates in
effect on July 1, 2011 are predicated for each site operated by that provider
shall be summed. (d) If the
operating component of the single provider-specific rate calculated in
accordance with clauses (
a
), (
b
) and
(
c
) of this subparagraph represents an ICF/DD operating
funding level which is greater than the aggregate ICF/DD operating funding
level at June 30, 2011 for the provider, then the July 1, 2011
provider-specific rate will be the consolidation of the provider's June 30, 2011 ICF/DD rates. If the single provider-specific operating rate calculated in
accordance with clauses (
a
), (
b
) and
(
c
) of this subparagraph represents an ICF/DD operating
funding level for the provider which is less than the aggregate ICF/DD
operating funding level at June 30, 2011, then the July 1, 2011
provider-specific rate will be the higher of the single provider-specific
operating rate calculated in accordance with clauses (
a
), (
b
) and (
c
) of this subparagraph or the
operating rate which represents a funding reduction of 10 percent of the
aggregate ICF/DD operating funding level for the provider at June 30, 2011. (ii)

Sites opening
after July 1, 2011. For a facility that was not operating on June 30, 2011, or
was not certified as an ICF/DD on June 30, 2011, the initial site-specific rate
shall be the current agency ICF/DD rate or a rate based on budgeted costs if
the commissioner determines that a rate based on budgeted costs is needed
because the current agency ICF/DD rate would not appropriately reimburse the
ICF/DD when taking into consideration the disability levels of the ICF/DD
individuals. In establishing a rate based on budgeted costs, the commissioner
shall adjust the budgeted costs for the facility by whichever of the following
cost information is available and reflects necessary costs for operating the
new facility: actual costs of similar existing facilities operated by the
provider, or average costs of other facilities in the same region and
historical data for similar facilities, in order to establish a rate that uses
the most comparable data when taking into consideration the disability levels
of the ICF/DD individuals. The approved site-specific rates shall be
incorporated into the single rate for all facilities operated by a provider
according to the process outlined in clauses (i)(
a
), (
b
) and (
c
) of this paragraph. The
recalculated provider-specific rate will be effective on the date of the
certification of the new site. (iii)

As of July 1, 2011, all unresolved desk
audits precipitated by rebasing to the base year 1999/1999-2000 shall be closed
and there shall be no further attempts to effect rate adjustments or
reconciliations. (e) Cost category screens and
reimbursement for over 30-bed facilities. In order to determine the reimbursable operating costs to be
included in the rate calculation, the following screens (
i.e., the maximum amount that will be allowed for a specific item or group of items)
will be used. (1)

Direct care, mid-level supervision, and clinical personal service cost category screens: (i) For every new rate cycle, OPWDD shall
develop values by applying a maximum statewide salary amount to a facility's
applicable individual specific staffing standards. Refer to paragraphs (5)-(8)
of this subdivision. (ii)

These
standards shall reflect the severity of disabilities of the population residing
at the facility as determined by the procedures outlined in paragraphs (5)-(7)
of this subdivision; the number of beds in the facility; whether or not a
facility provides on-site day program services; and the persons the facility
provides services to (
i.e., adults, children or
both). (iii)

For any facility which
elects to participate in the salary enhancement plan as evidenced by adoption
of a resolution of its governing body, effective on the later of October 1, 1987, or the date of adoption of such resolution, the direct care/support
reimbursement will be adjusted to reflect the obligation to pay salary levels
established by adoption of the resolution referred to in this subparagraph. In
absence of such an election, the standard shall be determined by the facility's
actual salary amount based upon the budget or cost report used to establish the
rate being adjusted or calculated. (2)

Administrative and support cost category
screens: (i) OPWDD shall develop values for
every new rate cycle by application of a statewide maximum allowable
cost. (ii)

The personal service
costs shall be determined by applying a maximum statewide salary amount to the
allowable staffing level contained in this subdivision. (iii)

For any facility which elects to
participate in the salary enhancement plan as evidenced by adoption of a
resolution of its governing body, effective on the later of October 1, 1987, or
the date of adoption of such resolution, the direct care/support reimbursement
will be adjusted to reflect the obligation to pay salary levels established by
adoption of the resolution referred to in this subparagraph. In the absence of
such an election, the standard shall be determined by the facility's actual
salary amount based upon the budget or cost report used to establish the rate
being adjusted or calculated. (3)

Fringe benefit cost category screens: (i) For every new rate cycle, OPWDD shall
compute a facility-specific fringe benefit percentage. This percentage shall be
determined by computing the total fringe benefit cost from the base year budget
or cost report and dividing this total by the total personal service cost
(exclusive of contracted personal service) from the base year budget or cost
report. For every rate cycle after April 1, 1984, this percentage shall be the
lower of the previous rate cycle cost-based fringe benefit percentage plus one
percent or a new percentage computed in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence. If a facility's previous rate is based upon a budget, it is
not subject to the aforementioned one-percent fringe benefit
limitation. (ii)

To determine the
fringe benefit component of the rate, the facility-specific fringe benefit
percentage shall be multiplied by the total reimbursable personal service
dollars exclusive of contracted personal services. (iii)

For newly certified facilities, the
fringe benefit percentage allowed shall not exceed the average allowed for
existing facilities (regardless of size) currently operated by the provider. If
there are no existing facilities, then the fringe benefit percentage allowed
shall not exceed the fringe benefit percentage of any other programs operated
by the provider. If the provider does not operate any other programs, then the
fringe benefit percentage allowed shall not exceed the regional average for
other facilities. (iv)

Any increase
in the fringe benefit percentage due to Federal or State laws, rules or
regulations shall not be subject to the percent increase limitation described
in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (v) If a newly certified facility whose base
period rate was determined from total reimbursable budget costs, submits a cost
report for the subsequent period in accordance with Subpart 635-4 of this

Title, a new fringe benefit percentage shall be computed by dividing these
costs by the total personal service costs (exclusive of contracted services) as
submitted in the new cost report. This percentage shall be subject to the
limitations of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. (4)

Other than personal service
(OTPS) and overhead shall be combined into one cost category screen. (i) The other than personal service cost
category screen will be based on a per bed amount effective at the beginning of
each new rate cycle (see paragraph [8] of this subdivision). (ii)

The overhead cost category screen will
be a percentage of reimbursable personal service and fringe benefits (see
paragraph [8] of this subdivision). This screen will be compared to reported
cost or budget costs (agency administration, personal service, OTPS, fringe
benefits and capital costs) to determine reimbursable costs. (iii)

Costs associated with transportation to
and from physician, dentist and other clinical services shall be included in
the other than personal service screen and subject to the limitations contained
therein. (5)

(f) Allowable costs. To be considered allowable, costs must be properly chargeable
to necessary individual care rendered in accordance with the requirements of
this Part. (1)

Allowable costs
(general). (i) Except where rules concerning
allowability of costs are stated herein, the Medicare Provider Reimbursement

Manual, commonly referred to as HIM-15, shall be used to determine the
allowability of costs. HIM-15 is published by the U.S. Department of Health and

Human Services' Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and is available
from: Health Care Financing Administration, Division of Communication Services, Production and Distribution Branch, Room 577, East High Rise Building, 6325

Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21207. It may be reviewed in person during
regular business hours at the NYS Department of State, 41 State Street, Albany, NY 12207; or, by appointment, at the NYS Office for People With Developmental

Disabilities, Division of Revenue Management, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY
12229-0001. (ii)

Where rules stated
herein, or in Subpart 635-6 of this Title, or in HIM-15 are silent concerning
the allowability of costs, the commissioner shall determine allowability of
costs based on reasonableness and relationship to individual care and generally
accepted accounting principles. (iii)

Expenses or portions of expenses
reported by a facility that are not reasonably related to the efficient and
economical provision of care in accordance with the requirements of this Part, because of either the nature or amount of the item, shall be not
allowed. (iv)

Costs which are not
properly related to individual care or treatment, and which principally afford
diversion, entertainment or amusement to owners, operators or employees of the
facility, shall not be allowed. (v) The OPWDD shall reduce a facility's base year costs/budget costs by the costs
of such services and activities that are not chargeable to the care of
individual in accordance with this subdivision. (a) In the event that the commissioner
determines that it is not practical to establish the costs of such services and
activities, the income derived therefrom shall be substituted as the basis for
reductions of the facility's reported or estimated costs. (b) Examples of sources of such income
include, but are not limited to: (1)
supplies
and drugs sold by the facility for use by nonresidents; (2)
telephone and telegraph services for
which a charge is made; (3)
discount on purchases; (4)
employees' rental of living quarters; (5)
cafeterias; (6)
meals provided to staff or an
individual's guests for which there is a charge; (7)
operating parking facilities for
community convenience; and
(8)
lease of office and other space by concessionaires providing services not
related to intermediate care facility services. (vi)

Costs for any interest expense related
to funding expenses in excess of an approved rate, or penalty imposed by
governmental agencies or courts and the costs of insurance policies obtained
solely to insure against such penalty, shall not be allowed. OPWDD will not pay
interest on the final dollar settlement resulting from the retrospective impact
of the rate appeals. (vii)

Costs of
contributions or other payments to political parties, candidates or
organizations shall not be allowed. (viii)

Restricted funds are funds expended by
the facility, which include grants, gifts, and income from endowments, whether
cash or otherwise, which must be used only for a specific purpose as designated
by the donor or grant instrument. Except as provided for in subparagraphs (iii)
and (iv) of this paragraph, restricted funds are to be deducted from the
designated costs when determining allowable costs. The commissioner may waive
the provisions of this subparagraph at his discretion only in those instances
where the provider makes a reasonable showing that the imposition of the
requirements of this subparagraph would cause undue financial harm to the
existence of the facility. (ix)

Only that portion of the dues paid to any professional association which has
been demonstrated to be attributable to expenditures other than for lobbying or
political contributions shall be allowed. (x) A monetary value assigned to services
provided by a religious order for services rendered to an owner and operator of
a facility shall be considered allowable subject to review by OPWDD for
reasonableness. (xi)

Funded
depreciation. (a) Applicability. This
subparagraph shall apply to all facilities except those governed by
subparagraph (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph and those for which the provider
is receiving or has a commitment to receive HUD funding. This section shall
apply to facilities which were governed by subparagraph (3)(iii) or (iv) of
this subdivision but which are no longer governed by either such section
because the provider has repaid the entire principal owed on the real property
of the facility. (b) Effective

April 1, 1986, for any rate period during which the reimbursement attributable
to depreciation on a facility's real property, excluding equipment, exceeds the
provider's principal repayment obligations on indebtedness attributable to such
real property, such provider shall fund depreciation by depositing such
difference in an interest- bearing checking account or other secure investment. If the provider operates more than one facility governed by this paragraph, the
provider may maintain one funded depreciation account for two or more
facilities. The provider shall not commingle such funded depreciation accounts
with other monies of the provider. The provider shall not be required to fund
depreciation attributable to the provider's equity in such real property. The
provider may expend the funds in such account, including accrued interest, to
retire all or a portion of the indebtedness attributable to such real property, or for building improvements and/or fixed equipment necessary to the
facility. (c) OPWDD will not
reimburse interest expense incurred to meet funded depreciation, pursuant to
this subparagraph and subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph. (2)

Allowable costs
(operating). (i) Interest on working capital
indebtedness in accordance with standards listed in section
635-6.4
(h) of
this Title and subject to the limitations of paragraph (d)(1) or (e)(4) of this
section will be considered allowable. In the event that a loan is not in
accordance with the standards listed above, then the approval of the
commissioner is required. (ii)

Effective April 16, 1992, costs incurred as a result of the provider of
services assessment charged pursuant to section
43.04
of
the Mental Hygiene Law in the amount of 2.4 percent of the 3 percent assessment
charged on cash receipts shall be included in the rate. (iii)

Effective April 4, 1996, costs in
excess of 0.6 percent incurred as a result of the provider of services
assessment charged on cash receipts pursuant to section
43.04
of
the Mental Hygiene Law shall be included in the rate. Effective April 1, 1999, costs in excess of 0.3 percent incurred as a result of the provider of services

Allowable operating costs shall also
include, but not be limited to, personal service, fringe benefits, OTPS, utility, administration costs, as well as day treatment, day services, and
transportation costs, and regional FTE add-ons. (v) Effective April 1, 2005, costs incurred
as a result of requests for criminal history record checks under section
16.33
of
the Mental Hygiene Law and section
845-b
of the

Executive Law shall be allowable costs and shall be considered part of the
rate. (3)

Allowable
costs (capital). (i) Start-up costs are those
costs which are incurred from the period the provider receives approval
pursuant to Part 620 of this Title for a facility to become an intermediate
care facility to the date the first individual is admitted. However, costs
incurred during the period from the first admission to the effective date of
the initial provider agreement shall not be considered as start-up costs. (a) OPWDD may, at the discretion of the
commissioner, reimburse a provider for all allowable start-up costs incurred in
the preparation of the provider during that six-month period prior to the date
of the first admission. A provider may apply to the commissioner for an
extension of the six-month reimbursable start-up period, provided that the
provider can demonstrate why such an extension is necessary. However, under no
circumstances shall a facility be allowed reimbursement of start-up costs for
any period of time exceeding 18 months prior to the date of the first
admission. (b) Allowable start-up
costs may include, but not be limited to: (1)
personal service expenses; (2)
utility expenses; (3)
taxes; (4)
insurance
expenses; (5)
employee training
expenses; (6)
housekeeping
expenses; (7)
repair and
maintenance expenses; and
(8)
administrative expenses. (c) Any costs that are properly identifiable
as organization costs, or capitalizable as construction costs, shall be
classified as such and excluded from start-up costs. (d) If a provider intends to prepare all
portions of its entire facility at the same time, start-up costs for all
portions of the facility shall be accumulated in a single deferred account and
shall be amortized from the date of the first admission. However, if a provider
intends to prepare only portions of its facility (
e.g., preparation of a floor or wing), start-up costs shall be capital and amortized
separately. In either case, unless reimbursed as described in subparagraph (iv)
of this paragraph, start-up costs shall be amortized over a period not to
exceed 60 months from the date of the first admission. (ii)

For any transaction resulting in a
change of ownership, the valuation of the assets shall be limited to the lesser
of the allowable acquisition cost of the assets to the first owner of record
who has received Medicaid payment for the assets in question on or after August
1, 1982, minus any paid depreciation (
i.e., seller's net book
value) or the acquisition cost of the asset to the new owner. (iii)

Notwithstanding subparagraph (1)(viii)
of this subdivision, in the case of any provider which has been notified by
OPWDD on or after April 1, 1986 that there is a preliminary reservation of

State aid funds for a capital grant pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law, section
41.18(c) or 41.23, the basis for computing depreciation on the facility which
is the subject of the capital grant shall include the facility's depreciable
project costs which were funded with such capital grant, provided that the
provider is not receiving and does not have a commitment to receive HUD funding
for the facility, and has not repaid the entire principal owed on the real
property of the facility. If the depreciable project costs are adjusted after
audit, the basis for computing depreciation on the facility will be changed to
such adjusted depreciable project costs. Upon full repayment of principal, the
basis for depreciation for the facility will cease to include the amount of the
capital grant. Any provider which receives such a capital grant shall enter
into certain assurances with the OPWDD whereby the provider agrees that: (a) The difference between depreciation in
the rate attributable to the facility's depreciable project costs (other than
depreciation attributable to the provider's equity in the facility's real
property at the time such property is put into use as a facility) and the
principal which is repaid shall be deposited in a secure investment approved by
the commissioner. (b) Withdrawals
from such investment shall be made only for the purpose of repayment of
indebtedness owed on the real property of the facility. With the commissioner's
approval based on cost savings, a provider may use withdrawals from such
investment for repayment of indebtedness owed on the real property of another
facility which received a capital grant under this subparagraph or under
subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, or if there is no such other facility
which is mortgaged, for the repayment of indebtedness owed on the real property
of another facility which is mortgaged under the same mortgage as the
facility. (c) Each withdrawal must
be approved by the commissioner. (d) If the provider ceases to operate the
facility as an intermediate care facility for developmentally disabled, or as
any facility certified by OPWDD, it will repay to the OPWDD the balance on
deposit in the secure investment at the time of such cessation, including
interest earned on the investment. (e) Depreciable project costs shall mean
those acquisition and construction costs of a facility which have been
approved, either before or after audit, by the New York State Office of the

State Comptroller or by OPWDD or by OPWDD's designee. Such costs shall not
include the cost of land. (f) HUD
funding shall mean lower income housing assistance under section 8 of the

United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended
42
U.S.C. section
1437(f)
and/or a loan or loans pursuant to section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as
amended
12
U.S.C. section
1701(q). (iv)

Notwithstanding subparagraph
(1)(viii) of this subdivision, any provider which has been notified by OPWDD
before April 1, 1986 that there is a preliminary reservation of State aid funds
for a capital grant pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law, section 41.18(c) or 41.23, which is not receiving and has no commitment to receive HUD funding for the
facility which is the subject of the capital grant, may apply to the
commissioner to have the basis for computing depreciation on the facility
include the facility's depreciable project costs which were funded with the
capital grant. Such application must be submitted to the commissioner on or
before September 30, 1986 on the forms prescribed by the commissioner. Such
application shall be granted at the discretion of the commissioner upon a
showing that inclusion in the depreciation basis of the facility's depreciable
project costs which were funded with the capital grant is necessary to the
financial viability of the facility and will not impede the facility's
efficient and economical operation. If the commissioner approves such
application, the facility's rate shall be revised retroactive to April 1, 1986
to include in the depreciation basis the facility's depreciable project costs
which were funded with the capital grant, and the provider shall enter into
certain assurances described in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. Upon full
repayment of principal, the basis for depreciation for the facility will cease
to include the amount of the capital grant. If the depreciable project costs
are adjusted after audit, the basis for computing depreciation on the facility
will be changed to such adjusted depreciation project costs. (g) Adjustments. Effective January 1, 2005 for Region II and III facilities, and effective July 1, 2005 for Region I facilities, there shall be an
efficiency adjustment for under 31-bed facilities as described herein and
applied as a reduction to reimbursable operating costs. (1)
A determination shall be made as to
whether each provider has a per bed surplus or loss for all its under 31-bed
facilities. (i) Surplus/loss shall equal
operating revenue minus operating costs. (a) For purposes of this efficiency adjustment, operating revenue and costs are net
of day treatment, day service, transportation, and regional FTE
add-ons. (b) Revenue for
determining the surplus/loss calculations for all facilities in all regions is
from the rate effective July 1, 2004. (c) Costs for determining the surplus/loss
calculations are from the 2001 or 2001-2002 cost reporting year, trended to
2004 or 2004-2005 dollars. (ii)

The value of the surplus/loss is divided
by the total number of beds in all of the provider's under 31-bed facilities to
determine the provider's per bed surplus/loss value. (2)

Regional ranking of the per bed
surplus/loss value. (i) Within each of the
three regions, the per bed surplus/loss values are ranked and identified in
descending order. (ii)

Within each
region, the ranking is divided into five groups. Region I
Surplus/Loss Range (Per Bed)

Efficiency Group 5
$17,498 to $4,289

Efficiency Group 4
$4,288 to $523

Efficiency Group 3
$522 to ($2,986)

Efficiency Group 2
($2,987) to ($7,465)

Efficiency Group 1
($7,466) to ($42,035)

Region II
Surplus/Loss Range (Per Bed)

Efficiency Group 5
$17,478 to $6,354

Efficiency Group 4
$6,353 to $4,081

Efficiency Group 3
$4,080 to $873

Efficiency Group 2
$872 to ($5,343)

Efficiency Group 1
($5,344) to ($16,087)

Region III
Surplus/Loss Range (Per Bed)

Efficiency Group 5
$12,398 to $7,216

Efficiency Group 4
$7,215 to $2,207

Efficiency Group 3
$2,206 to ($1,049)

Efficiency Group 2
($1,050 to ($6,440)

Efficiency Group 1
($6,441) to ($15,631)
(3)

Each of the five groups within each
region is assigned an ordinal weight. Group 5 = 5 Group 4 = 4 Group 3 = 3 Group 2 = 2 Group 1 =
1
(4)

Determination of
total adjustment per facility. (i) The number
of beds in the facility is multiplied by its assigned ordinal weight and the
result is multiplied by $334. (ii)

The facility's reimbursable operating costs are reduced by the amount
determined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (5)

Reallocation of costs. The following
changes to cost allocations for all under 31-bed facilities are effective

January 1, 2005 for Region II and III facilities, and effective July 1, 2005
for Region I facilities. (i) General
insurance costs are reallocated from base year administration OTPS costs to
base year support OTPS costs. (ii)

Property and casualty insurance costs are removed from base year administration
OTPS costs. Property and casualty insurance costs from the appropriate cost
report period are included in capital costs. (iii)

Expensed equipment costs from the base
year cost report are included in support OTPS costs. Expensed equipment costs
are not included in capital costs. (h) Trend factors. OPWDD shall employ any or all of the following trend factor
components to the reimbursable operating costs. (1)

percent; (xv)
3.52
percent for 2000 to 2001; (xvi)
effective February 1, 2002, facilities will receive an amount that they would

2002 to 2003; (xx)
effective

February 1, 2004, facilities will receive an amount that they would have
received if the trend factor in subparagraph (xix) of this paragraph for the
calendar year 2003 were increased in the amount of 3.12 percent. The trend
factor for the rate year ending December 31, 2003 shall be deemed to be
increased in the amount of 3.12 percent; (xxi)

trend factor in subparagraph (xxviii) of this paragraph for the rate period of

January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 had been 3.06 percent. The trend
factor in effect for the calendar year rate period ending December 31, 2009
shall be deemed to be the 3.06 percent full annual trend. Retention of the
proceeds attributable to the application of the trend factor increase shall be
contingent upon the provider reporting the use of the funds in the form and
format specified by the commissioner; and
(xxx)
from February 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010, facilities shall be reimbursed operating costs that result in a full
annual trend factor of 2.08 percent for the 2010 calendar year rate period. The
trend factor in effect for the rate period ending December 31, 2010 shall be
deemed to be the 2.08 percent full annual trend. Retention of the proceeds
attributable to the application of the trend factor increase shall be
contingent upon the provider reporting the use of the funds in the form and
format specified by the commissioner. (5)

Where appropriate, the commissioner shall
use some combination in whole or in part of the yearly components to project
cost data into the appropriate rate period. (i) Appeals to rates. (1)

For appeals for rate periods before July
1, 2011, the commissioner will consider only the following appeals for
adjustment to the rates which would result in an annual increase of $1,000 or
more in a facility's allowable costs, and are: (i) needed because of changes in the
statistical information used to calculate a facility's staffing or utilization
standards; (ii)
requests for relief
from the standards contained in subdivision (d) or (e) of this section which
were applied to costs used in calculating the base period and subsequent period
rates; (iii)
appeals for
adjustments needed because of material errors in the information submitted by
the facility which OPWDD used to establish the rate, or material errors in the
rate computation; or
(iv)
appeals
for significant increases or decreases in a facility's overall base period
operating costs due to implementation of new programs, changes in staff or
service, changes in the characteristics or number of individuals, changes in a
lease agreement so as not to involve a related party, capital renovations, expansions or replacements which have been either mandated or approved by the
commissioner and, except in life-threatening situations, approved in advance by
the appropriate State agencies. (2)

For rate periods beginning July 1, 2011
and thereafter, the commissioner will consider appeals for adjustment to the
rates which: (i) would result in an annual
increase of $5,000 or more in the provider's allowable costs; and
(ii)
are needed because of the occurrence of
bed vacancies. (3)

Notification of first level appeal. (i) In
order to appeal a rate in accordance with subparagraphs (1)(ii)-(iii) of this
subdivision, the provider must send to OPWDD an appeal application by certified
mail, return receipt requested, either within 90 days of the facility receiving
the rate computation or within 90 days of the beginning of the rate period in
question, whichever is later. (ii)

In order to appeal a rate in accordance with subparagraph (1)(i) or (iv) or
paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the provider must send to OPWDD, within one
year of the close of the rate period in question, a first level appeal
application by certified mail, return receipt requested. (4)

First level rate appeal applications
shall be made in writing to the commissioner. (i) The application shall set forth the basis
for the first level appeal and the issues of fact. Appropriate documentation
shall accompany the application and OPWDD may request such additional
documentation as it deems necessary. (ii)

Actions on first level rate appeal
applications will be processed without unjustifiable delay. (5)

The burden of proof on the
first level appeal shall be on the provider to demonstrate that the rate
requested in the appeal is necessary to ensure efficient and economical
operation. (6)
A rate revised by
OPWDD pursuant to an appeal shall not be considered final unless and until
approved by the State Division of the Budget. (7)

At no point in the first level appeal
process shall the provider have a right to an interim report of any
determinations made by any of the parties to the appeal. At the conclusion of
the first level appeal process OPWDD shall notify the provider of any proposed
revised rate or denial of same. Once OPWDD has informed the provider of the
appeal outcome, a provider which submits a revised cost report for the period
reviewed on appeal shall not be entitled to an increase in the award
determination based on that resubmission. OPWDD shall inform the provider that
it may either accept the proposed revised rate or request a second level appeal
in accordance with section
602.9
of this Title in the event
that the proposed revised rate fails to grant some or all of the relief
requested. (8)

If OPWDD approves
the revision to the rate and State Division of the Budget denies the revision, the provider shall have no further right to administrative review pursuant to
this section. (9)

Any rate revised
in accordance with this subdivision shall be effective according to the dates
indicated in the rate appeal notification. (10)

Any additional reimbursement received by
the provider, pursuant to a rate revised in accordance with this subdivision, shall be restricted to the specific purpose set forth in the appeal
decision. (11)

Second level appeals
to rates. (i) OPWDD's denial of the first
level appeal of any or all of the relief requested in the appeal provided for
in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision shall be final, unless the provider
requests a second level appeal to the commissioner in writing within 30 days of
service of notification of denial or proposed revised rate. (ii)

Second level appeals shall be brought
and determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of Part 602 of this

Title. (j) Employee health care enhancement (HCE). (1)

Providers are eligible to have additional
funding included in their rate if they submitted a completed 2005 OPWDD survey
on health care benefits for all full- and part-time employees. (2)

Based on a survey of providers, OPWDD
determined a benchmark of health care benefits offered to employees by
providers. In September 2005, OPWDD notified those providers if their health
care benefits were at, above, or below the benchmark. (3)

Effective January 1, 2006, providers may
receive additional funding as follows: (i) Providers whose employee health care benefits are at or above the benchmark
shall receive an amount equaling 3.0 percent of the operating costs contained
in the rate in effect on December 31, 2005 net of any funding provided pursuant
to paragraph (4) of this subdivision. Providers which receive this 3.0 percent
increase may not apply for employee health care funding described in
subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (ii)

Providers whose employee health care
benefits and below the benchmark may apply to OPWDD for additional funding as
follows: (a) For providers which reported on
the survey that no health care benefits are offered, OPWDD determined an
allocation for each provider based on the total number of employees reported
multiplied by $2,500, except that if there are any employees who were reported
on the survey and to whom the provider chooses not to offer this funding, the
allocation based on the total number of employees reported will be reduced by
the number of excluded employees reported multiplied by $2,500. These funds
must be used to establish employee health care benefits or to reduce employee
out-of-pocket health- related expenses. (b) For providers which reported on the
survey that employee health care benefits are offered to some or all employees, OPWDD determined an allocation for each provider based on the total number of
employees reported multiplied by $325, except that if there are any employees
who were reported on the survey and to whom the provider chooses not to offer
this funding, the allocation based on the total number of employees reported
will be reduced by the number of excluded employees reported multiplied by
$325. These funds must be used to enhance employee health care benefits or to
reduce employee out- of-pocket health-related expenses. (4)

Effective January 1, 2006, providers may receive additional funding that would have been received during
the period of April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005 if the funding described
in paragraph (3) of this subdivision had been paid. (i) Providers whose employee health care
benefits are at or above the benchmark shall receive an amount equaling 3.0
percent of the operating costs contained in the rate in effect on December 31, 2005, adjusted for the 21-month period from April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005. Providers which receive this 3.0 percent increase may not apply for
employee health care funding described in subparagraph (ii) of this
paragraph. (ii)

Providers whose
employee health care benefits are below the benchmark may apply to OPWDD for
additional funding as follows: (a) For
providers which reported on the survey that no employee health care benefits
are offered, no additional funding for the period of April 1, 2004 through

December 31, 2005 is available. (b) For providers which reported on the survey that employee health care benefits
are offered to some or all employees, OPWDD determined an allocation for each
provider based on the total number of employees reported multiplied by $325, except that if there are any employees who were reported on the survey and to
whom the provider chooses not to offer this funding, the allocation based on
the total number of employees reported will be reduced by the number of
excluded employees reported multiplied by $325. The annual allocation of $325
will be adjusted for the 21-month period of April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005. These funds must be used to reimburse health care expenses paid by
employees. (5)

In order to receive an allocation
described in subparagraph (3)(ii) or (4)(ii) of this subdivision, the provider
must send to OPWDD a completed written application submitted in the form and
format specified by the commissioner. (6)

Funding is contingent upon OPWDD's
approval of the application. OPWDD will base its decision on whether the
application is complete; whether it complies with the requirements of this
subdivision; and whether the application recognizes the provider's lowest paid
employees. OPWDD may request additional information and/or documentation as
needed before approving the application. (7)

Payment of the allocation described in
subparagraph (3)(ii) or (4)(ii) of this subdivision shall be subject to the
provider submitting a resolution by its governing body that funds received will
be used to implement the plans described in the provider's approved
application. To receive the allocation, the provider must submit the resolution
and the commission may approve it. (8)

For the purposes of the July 1, 2011, rate calculations, OPWDD shall assume that providers have allocated all
expenses matched to their HCE I revenues to the fringe benefit cost category in
their cost reports. (9)
A rate
revised by OPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final
unless and until approved by the State Division of the Budget. (k) Employee health care
enhancement II. (1)

Effective January
1, 2007 providers may be eligible to receive funding for the health care
enhancement II (HCE II). Provides must use these funds to establish or enhance
employee health care benefits or to reduce employee out of pocket health care
expenses. (2)

In order to receive
funding described in this subdivision the provider must have sent to OPWDD a
completed written application by July 31, 2006, unless this deadline was
extended by the commissioner. (3)

Funding is contingent upon OPWDD's approval of the application. OPWDD shall
decide whether to approve the application based on whether the application is
complete; whether it complies with the requirements of this subdivision; and
whether the application recognizes the provider's lowest paid employees. OPWDD
may request additional information and/or documentation, or revisions to an
application, before approving the application. (4)

Funding for HCE II is available at either
$2,500 per employee or $425 per employee, as follows: (i) The annual allocation at the $2,500 level
is determined by OPWDD based on the total number of employees included in the
provider's approved HCE II application multiplied by $2,500. Funding at the
$2,500 level is available to providers which: (a) submitted an application for HCE II
funding at the $2,500 level; and
(b) do not offer health care benefits; and
(c) were insufficiently funded
for health care, as determined by OPWDD. Affected providers were notified by
OPWDD of this determination. (ii)

The annual allocation at the $425 level
is determined by OPWDD based on the total number of employees included in the
provider's approved HCE II application multiplied by $425. Funding at the $425
level is available to providers which: (a) offer health care benefits to some or all employees and submitted an
application for HCE II funding at the $425 level; or
(b) applied for HCE II funding at the $2,500
level but received funding at the $2,500 per employee level pursuant to
subdivision (j) of this section; or
(c) submitted an application at the $2,500
level but have sufficient funding for health care, as determined by OPWDD. Affected providers were notified by OPWDD of this determination. (5)

The application
submitted to OPWDD shall include plans for the expenditure of the HCE II
allocation in conformance with this subdivision. Such HCE II plans shall assure
that all employees included in the application are entitled to some benefit
from HCE II, although the value per employee may be lesser or greater than
$2,500 or $425 per employee. Higher paid employees whose earnings exceed a
salary cap established by the provider may be excluded from receipt of any HCE
II funds if these funds are reallocated to lower paid staff. (6)
A provider approved to receive HCE II
funding pursuant to subparagraph (4)(ii) of this subdivision shall receive an
amount that would have been paid if the HCE II initiative had been implemented

April 1, 2006. (7)

Payment of the
HCE II funding shall be subject to the provider submitting a resolution by its
governing body that funds received shall be used to implement the plans
described in the provider's approved application. To receive the allocation the
provider must submit the resolution and the commissioner must approve
it. (8)

For the purpose of the July
1 2011 rate calculations, OPWDD shall assume that providers have allocated all
expenses matched to their HCE II revenues to the fringe benefit cost category
in their cost reports. (9)
A rate
revised by OPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final
unless and until approved by the State Division of the Budget. (l) Employee health care
enhancement III. (1)

Effective January
1, 2008 providers may be eligible to receive funding for the health care
enhancement III (HCE III) included in their rate. (2)

Funding. Based on a survey of providers'
historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark of health
care benefits offered to employees by providers. Prior to September 30, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible for HCE III funding
at the benchmark level. Providers deemed eligible for HCE III funding below the
benchmark level were mailed applications with instructions. (i) Providers deemed eligible for HCE III
funding at the benchmark level shall receive an amount equaling 3.0 percent of
the operating costs exclusive of any HCE III component contained in the rate in
effect on January 1, 2008 net of any funding provided pursuant to subparagraph
(iii) of this paragraph. A provider eligible for HCE III funding at the
benchmark level will receive a 1.0 percent funding increase in all its programs
and services eligible under this Chapter if the provider notified OPWDD by

October 31, 2007 that it was declining the 3.0 percent funding level increase
and electing instead to receive a 1.0 percent funding level increase in all its
programs and services eligible under this Chapter. Providers which receive this
3.0 percent or 1.0 percent funding level increase may not apply for employee
health care funding described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (ii)

Providers deemed eligible for HCE III
funding below the benchmark level may apply to OPWDD to receive an amount
equaling 1.0 percent of the operating costs exclusive of any HCE III component
contained in the rate in effect on January 1, 2008 net of any funding provided
pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (a) Providers shall use these funds to
establish or enhance employee health care benefits and/or to reduce employee
out-of-pocket health care expenses and/or to offset the portion of premium
increases paid by the provider which exceeds the portion of the trend factor or
COLA applicable to those premium increases. Providers shall assure that
benefits resulting from this additional funding recognize their lower paid
employees. (b) In order to receive
the funding described in this subdivision, the provider must have sent to OPWDD
a completed application and attestation received or postmarked by October 1, 2007, unless the deadline was extended by the commissioner. In the application
and attestation, the provider must have indicated its intended use of the
funds; agreed to obtain a resolution by December 31, 2007 from its governing
body authorizing such use; and agreed to maintain on file the resolution as
well as records detailing the distribution of HCE III funds. (c) Funding is contingent upon OPWDD's
approval of the application and attestation. OPWDD shall decide whether to
approve the application and attestation based on whether it is complete and
conforms to the requirements of this subdivision. OPWDD may request additional
information or documentation before approving the application and
attestation. (iii)
A
provider approved to receive HCE III funding pursuant to subparagraph (i) or
(ii) of this paragraph shall receive an amount that would have been paid if the
HCE III initiative had been implemented April 1, 2007. (3)

For the purpose of the July, 1 2011 rate
calculations, OPWDD shall assume that providers have allocated all expenses
matched to their HCE III revenues to the fringe benefit cost category in their
cost reports. (4)
A rate revised by
OPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final unless and
until approved by the State Division of the Budget. (m) Health care adjustments (HCA) IV
and V. (1)

Effective November 1, 2009, providers may be eligible to receive funding for health care adjustments IV and
V included in their rates. (2)

Benchmark providers and non-benchmark providers. Based on a survey of
providers' historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark
of health care related benefits offered to employees by providers. Prior to

October 31, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible
for HCE III funding at the benchmark level. Providers eligible for HCE III
funding at the benchmark level are eligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding at the
benchmark level. All other providers are eligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding
below the benchmark level. (3)

Funding. (i) Providers eligible for HCA IV
and HCA V funding at the benchmark level. (a) The HCA IV and HCA V funding levels for benchmark providers shall be 3.0
percent of the allowable operating costs used in establishing the provider
specific rates. Each adjustment shall be applied sequentially to effect
compounding of the adjustments. (b) Alternatively, a provider deemed eligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding at the
benchmark level shall receive for each adjustment (IV and V) a 1.0 percent
funding increase in all its programs and services eligible under this Chapter
if the provider notified OPWDD by September 11, 2009 in writing that it was
declining the 3.0 percent funding level increase and electing instead to
receive a 1.0 percent funding level increase for each adjustment (IV and V) in
all its programs and services eligible under this Chapter. Increases for HCA IV
and HCA V shall be applied sequentially to effect compounding of the
adjustments. (c) Providers eligible
for funding at the benchmark level may not apply for employee health care
funding described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (ii)

Providers eligible for HCA IV and HCA V
funding below the benchmark level may apply to OPWDD to receive these funds. (a) The HCA IV and HCA V funding levels for
non-benchmark providers shall be 1.0 percent of the allowable operating costs
used in establishing the provider specific rates. Each adjustment shall be
applied sequentially to effect compounding of the adjustments. (b) Providers shall use these funds first to
offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds shall be used to
establish or enhance employee health care related benefits and/or to reduce
employee out-of-pocket health care related expenses. (c) In order to receive HCA IV and HCA V
funds, the provider must have sent to OPWDD a completed application and
attestation received or postmarked no later than September 11, 2009 unless the
deadline was extended by the commissioner. In the application and attestation, the provider must have indicated its intended use of the funds; agreed to
obtain a resolution by October 31, 2009 from its governing body authorizing
such use; and agreed to maintain on file the resolution as well as records
detailing the distribution of HCA IV and HCA V funds. (d) Funding is contingent upon OPWDD's
approval of the application and attestation based on whether it is complete and
conforms to the requirements of this subdivision. OPWDD may request additional
information or documentation before approving the application and
attestation. (4)

Catch-up provisions. Effective November
1, 2009, benchmark providers shall be eligible and non-benchmark providers with
approved applications shall be eligible to receive additional funding for HCA
IV in an amount that would have been received for the period of April 1, 2008
through October 31, 2009 if the applicable increment had been implemented on

April 1, 2008. Effective November 1, 2009, benchmark providers and
non-benchmark providers with approved applications shall be eligible to receive
additional funding for HCA V in an amount that would have been received for the
period of April 1, 2009 through October 31, 2009 if the applicable increment
had been implemented on April 1, 2009. Nothing in this paragraph shall entitle
a provider to receive payment for services which have not been
provided. (5)

Consolidation of HCE
and HCA funds effective January 1, 2010. (i) Effective January 1, 2010, the HCE I through III and HCA IV and HCA V
components contained in the rate shall be consolidated into a single discrete
amount. For purposes of determining this amount, OPWDD shall combine the HCE I
through III and HCA IV and HCA V components contained in the initial rate in
effect on January 1, 2010. OPWDD shall use this fixed amount as the HCA payment
for the rate periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010. (ii)

Effective January 1, 2010, with the
consolidation of the health care adjustments, non-benchmark providers shall use
HCE I, II and III funds first to either offset health care premium increases
and/or to maintain benefits that were established and funded with previous HCE
I, II and III receipts. Remaining funds shall be used to establish or enhance
employee health care related benefits and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket
health care related expenses. Non-benchmark providers shall continue to use HCA
IV and V funds first to offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds
shall be used to establish or enhance employee health care related benefits
and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health care related expenses. Health
care enhancement/adjustment funds included in the rates for services delivered
on or after July 6, 2011 shall be used by non-benchmark providers for the
purposes described in this subparagraph and/or for any other options that
continue and/or enhance existing health care benefits and/or improve the
recruitment and/or retention of the provider's lower paid employees. However, in using these funds accordingly, non-benchmark providers may establish which
priorities serve the needs of such employees. Additionally, on July 6, 2011, health care enhancement/adjustment funding shall be included in the
reimbursable cost category of fringe benefits in the rate. (6)

Providers' distribution of HCA IV and HCA
V funds is subject to audit to ensure conformity with the requirements of this
subdivision and distribution of funds consistent with the provider's approved
application. (7)
A rate revised by
OPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final unless and
until approved by the State Division of the Budget. (n) Health care adjustment (HCA)
VI. (1)

Effective October 1, 2010, providers may be eligible to receive funding for health care adjustment VI
included in their rates. (2)

Benchmark providers and non-benchmark providers. Based on a survey of
providers' historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark
of health care related benefits offered to employees by providers. Prior to

October 31, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible
for health care enhancement (HCE) III funding at the benchmark level. These
providers are ""benchmark providers"" and are eligible for HCA VI funding at the
benchmark level. All other providers (""non-benchmark providers"") are eligible
for HCA VI funding below the benchmark level. (3)

Funding. (i) Providers eligible for HCA VI funding at
the benchmark level. (a) The HCA VI funding
levels for benchmark providers shall be 3.0 percent of the allowable operating
costs used in establishing the provider specific rates in effect on April 1, 2010. (b) Alternatively, a provider
eligible for HCA VI funding at the benchmark level shall receive a 1.0 percent
funding increase in all its programs and services eligible under this Chapter
if the provider notified OPWDD by August 13, 2010 in writing that it was
declining the 3.0 percent funding level increase and electing instead to
receive a 1.0 percent funding level increase for HCA VI in all its programs and
services eligible under this Chapter. (c) Providers eligible for funding at the
benchmark level may not apply for HCA VI funding described in subparagraph (ii)
of this paragraph. (ii)

Providers eligible for HCA VI funding below the benchmark level may apply to
OPWDD to receive these funds. (a) The HCA VI
funding level for non-benchmark providers shall be 1.0 percent of the allowable
operating costs used in establishing the provider specific rates in effect on

April 1, 2010. (b) Providers shall
use these funds first to offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds
shall be used to establish or enhance employee health care related benefits
and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health care related expenses. Health
care adjustment funds included in the rates for services delivered on or after

July 6, 2011 shall be used by non-benchmark providers for the purposes
described in this clause and/or for any other options that continue and/or
enhance existing health care benefits and/or improve the recruitment and/or
retention of the provider's lower paid employees. However, in using these funds
accordingly, non-benchmark providers may establish which priorities serve the
needs of such employees. Additionally, on July 6, 2011, health care adjustment
funding shall be included in the reimbursable cost category of fringe benefits
in the rate. (c) In order to
receive HCA VI funds, the provider must have sent to OPWDD a completed
application and attestation received or postmarked no later than August 13, 2010 unless the deadline was extended by the commissioner. In the application
and attestation, the provider must have indicated its intended use of the
funds; agreed to obtain a resolution by September 30, 2010 from its governing
body authorizing such use; and agreed to maintain on file the resolution as
well as records detailing the distribution of HCA VI funds. (d) Funding is contingent upon OPWDD's
approval of the application and attestation based on whether it is complete and
conforms to the requirements of this subdivision. OPWDD may request additional

State Regulations
(a) Generally. Upon receipt of a misbehavior report from the review officer, the hearing
officer shall commence the superintendent's hearing as follows: (1)

The misbehavior report shall be served on
the inmate at least 24 hours before the superintendent's hearing. If the inmate
is confined and requests an assistant, the hearing may not start until 24 hours
after the assistant's initial meeting with the inmate. (2)

The inmate shall be present at the
hearing unless he or she refuses to attend, or is excluded for reasons of
institutional safety or correctional goals. The entire hearing must be
electronically recorded. (3)

The
inmate when present may reply orally to the charge and/or evidence and shall be
allowed to submit relevant documentary evidence or written statements on his or
her behalf. (4)

When applicable, the information identified in subparagraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), (iv), (v), and
(2)(i), (ii), (iii), and subdivision (h) of this section, derived from the
department's electronic databases, shall automatically appear on a computer
generated hearing record sheet that shall be provided to the hearing officer
for use at the hearing. (b) Mental state or intellectual capacity. When an inmate's mental state or intellectual capacity is at issue, a hearing
officer shall consider evidence regarding the inmate's mental condition or
intellectual capacity at the time of the incident and at the time of the
hearing in accordance with this section. (1)

For the purposes of this section, an inmate's mental state shall be deemed at
issue when: (i) the inmate is classified as
level 1 by the Office of Mental Health (OMH), as indicated on the hearing
record sheet; (ii)
the inmate is
designated as an ""S"" by OMH, as indicated on the hearing record
sheet; (iii)
the inmate is charged
with engaging in an act of self-harm in violation of rule 123.10 (section
270.2
[B][23][i]
of this Title), as indicated on the misbehavior report; (iv)
the incident occurred while the inmate
was being transported to or from the Central New York Psychiatric Center
(CNYPC), as alleged in the misbehavior report; (v) the inmate was an inpatient at the CNYPC
within nine months prior to the incident, as indicated on the hearing record
sheet; (vi)
the incident occurred
while the inmate was assigned to an OMH satellite unit or intermediate care
program, as indicated on the hearing record sheet; (vii)
the incident occurred while the inmate
was being escorted to or from an OMH satellite unit or intermediate care
program, as alleged in the misbehavior report; (viii)
the hearing was delayed or adjourned, after an extension of time was obtained in accordance with section
251-5.1
of this Title, because the inmate became an inpatient at the CNYPC or was assigned to the OMH
satellite unit; or
(ix)
it appears
to the hearing officer, based on the inmate's testimony, demeanor, the
circumstances of the alleged offense or any other reason, that the inmate may
have been mentally impaired at the time of the incident or may be mentally
impaired at the time of the hearing. (2)

For the purposes of this section an
inmate's intellectual capacity shall be deemed at issue when: (i) the incident occurred while the inmate
was assigned to the special needs unit (SNU) at Wende, Arthurkill or Sullivan

Correctional Facilities, as indicated on the hearing record sheet; (ii)
the inmate has not scored above a 69 on
any intelligence testing instrument administered to the inmate by the
department and has not scored above a 3.0 grade level in any reading
comprehension testing instrument administered to the inmate by the department, as indicated on the hearing record sheet; or
(iii)
it appears to the hearing officer, based on the inmate's testimony, demeanor, the circumstances of the alleged
offense or any other reason, that the inmate may have been intellectually
impaired at the time of the incident or may be intellectually impaired at the
time of the hearing. (c) When an inmate's mental state or
intellectual capacity is at issue, pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, the hearing officer shall: (1)
ask the inmate
whether he or she understands the disciplinary charge, the purpose of the
hearing and the role of the participants in the hearing; (2)
inquire of other witnesses to the
incident, as may be called in accordance with section
254.5
of this

Part, concerning any observations that they may have regarding the inmate's
mental condition or intellectual capacity at the time of the incident; and
(3)
where an inmate's mental
state is at issue, out of the presence of the inmate and on a confidential
tape, interview an OMH clinician as may be available concerning the inmate's
mental condition at the time of the incident and the time of hearing; or
(4)
where an inmate's
intellectual capacity is at issue, out of the presence of the inmate and on a
confidential tape, interview a correction counselor or teacher as may be
available concerning the inmate's intellectual capacity at the time of the
incident and the time of the hearing. (d) If it is determined that the inmate is
unable to participate in the hearing process because the inmate does not
understand the disciplinary charge, the purpose of the hearing and the role of
the participants in the hearing, the hearing shall be adjourned until such time
as the inmate is able to participate in the hearing process and, if necessary, a request for a time extension shall be made in accordance with section
251-5.1
of this

Title. (e) If it is determined that
the inmate is able to participate in the hearing process but is in need of
assistance, the hearing shall be adjourned and the inmate shall be offered an
assistant in accordance with section
251-4.1
of this

Title. Pursuant to section
251-4.2
of this Title, the assistant may be required by the hearing officer to be present at the
hearing. (f) If it is determined
that the inmate is capable of proceeding with the hearing and a finding of
guilt is subsequently made with regard to one or more of the charges, the
hearing officer shall consider the inmate's mental condition or intellectual
capacity at the time of the incident, if at issue in accordance with paragraph
(b)(l) or (2) of this section, respectively, in determining the appropriate
penalty to be imposed under section
254.7
of this Part. In addition, if in light of the inmate's mental condition or
intellectual capacity, the hearing officer believes that a penalty with regard
to one or more of the charges would serve no useful purpose, the hearing
officer may dismiss the charge or charges altogether. The written statement of
the disposition of the charges, if any, shall, in accordance with section

and appropriate housing for patients to be discharged or conditionally
released. (2)

In some cases, this
goal can be met by organization and arrangement of physical facilities and
property of the facility when appropriate placement resources in the community
are inadequate. (b) The
placement of choice for many patients is in the home with the family which
preceded inpatient service. It is recognized that for some patients such a
situation never existed, for others no longer exists, and for still others
would not be appropriate to the needs of the patient. In these instances, other
placements may be appropriate under the following conditions: (1)

If the place of residence is subject to
licensure, certification or approval by the Department of Mental Hygiene or
other State agency such place of residence shall be currently and validly
licensed, certified or approved. (2)

If groups of patients are placed in homes
or apartments with no full-time on-site supervision by staff of a provider of
services, the placing facility shall consult appropriate local agencies to
determine that the building complies with local zoning, building, fire, and
safety codes, ordinances and regulations. (3)

If a patient is placed alone in a home, apartment, or room the placing facility shall take care that he is capable of
daily living without assistance. This care shall include but not be limited to
regular and frequent visits to the patient by facility staff or staff of
cooperating agencies to review adjustment during the initial period of
community placement. (c) The individual service plan of each patient to be placed in the community shall
include plans for placement and placement shall be made in accordance with such
plans. Such planning shall include, but not be limited to: (1)
review of the patient's physical, psychiatric, social and vocational conditions, disabilities and strengths, with
particular attention to those related to his or her placement
potential; (2)
services to overcome
disabilities and capitalize on strengths to enable the least restrictive
community placement possible; (3)
consideration of post-release supervision of the patient in the placement
residence in addition to the plan for outpatient services to overcome mental
disability; (4)
evidence of the
patient's participation and that of the patient's family and friends, when
appropriate, in the establishment of the placement plan and selection of the
placement residence; and
(5)
evidence of participation by staff of other agencies in the establishment of
the placement plan, the plan for outpatient services and the means of assuring
continuity of care, if services and supervision are to be provided by another
agency in whole or in part. Notes

members of the applicant's household must be residing together and must meet
the applicable household size requirements at the time of application and at
the time of apartment availability. Nevertheless, when appropriately
documented, a child subject to a joint custody agreement who lives with the

included in the household count. (b) Exceptions to the minimum household size
in the above schedule may be permitted in the following circumstances: (1)

To encourage downsizing from
underutilized units, a transfer to a smaller apartment may be permitted even if
the household size is less than the minimum. A housing company may create a
plan, with the division's approval, to provide additional incentives for such
downsizing. (2)

section
262
of the

Family Court Act, section
407
of the Surrogate's Court Procedure Act
or section
35
(8)
of the Judiciary Law shall be financially
eligible for counsel when the person's current available resources are
insufficient to pay for a qualified private attorney, the expenses necessary
for effective representation, and the reasonable living expenses of the person
and any dependents in the relevant jurisdiction. Counsel shall be provided
unless the person is conclusively ineligible based upon the criteria in this
section. The provisions of this section shall be applied uniformly, consistently, and with transparency. (a) Timely access to counsel. 1). Counsel shall be provided at the first
court appearance or immediately following the request for counsel, whichever is
earlier. Eligibility determinations shall be made in a timely fashion so that
representation by counsel is not delayed. 2). Counsel shall be provided to persons who
have not obtained counsel prior to initiation of a proceeding which may result
in detention, in removal of children from their care or where there is an
unavoidable delay in the eligibility determination, subject to judicial
approval once the court proceeding has begun. For timely access to counsel, a
person seeking counsel prior to the filing of a petition shall be provided with
the contact information of the entity which has the primary responsibility in
the jurisdiction for providing representation. 3). A parent or legally responsible person, as defined by law, shall be entitled to and provided with immediate
representation by counsel: (i) upon the filing
of a petition or pre-petition request under Article 10 of the Family Court Act
for an order for immediate removal of a child or temporary order of
protection; (ii)
where the court
has received notice of an extra-judicial emergency removal of a child; or
(iii)
upon the filing of a
petition alleging abuse or neglect against the parent or person legally
responsible. In accordance with this entitlement, counsel shall be provided
sufficiently in advance of the person's first court appearance, and shall also
be provided for parents during a child protective agency investigation, consistent with paragraph (2) of this
subdivision. (b) Presumptions of eligibility. The following presumptions of eligibility shall
apply and are rebuttable only where there is compelling evidence that the
person seeking counsel has the financial resources sufficient to pay for a
qualified private attorney, the expenses necessary for effective representation
in this and related proceedings, and the reasonable living expenses of the
party and any dependents in the relevant jurisdiction: 1). The person's net income is at or below
250% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, provided, however, that a person with
an income in excess of 250% of the guidelines shall not be denied counsel if
other criteria are met; 2). The
person is incarcerated, detained, or confined to a mental health
institution; 3). The person is
currently receiving, or has recently been deemed eligible pending receipt of, need-based public assistance, including but not limited to Family Assistance
(TANF), Safety Net Assistance (SNA), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI)/New York State Supplemental Program (SSP), Medicaid, or Public Housing assistance; or
4). The person has, within the past six
months, been deemed financially eligible for counsel in another court
proceeding in that jurisdiction or another jurisdiction. (c) Additional considerations. The following
factors shall be considered in determining a person's financial eligibility for
publicly funded counsel: 1). Debts and other
financial obligations, including the obligation to provide reasonable living
expenses of the person and his or her dependents in the relevant jurisdiction; and
2). The actual cost of
retaining a private attorney in the relevant jurisdiction for the type of
matter for which publicly funded counsel is sought. (d) Exclusions from assets of an applicant
seeking publicly funded counsel. 1). Non-liquid assets shall not be considered unless such assets have demonstrable
monetary value and are readily convertible to cash without impairing the
person's ability to provide for the reasonable living expenses of themselves
and their dependents in the relevant jurisdiction. Ownership of a vehicle shall
not be considered where such vehicle is necessary for basic life activities. The person's primary residence shall not be considered unless the fair market
value of the home is significant, there is substantial equity in the home, and
the person is able to access the equity in an amount and within a timeframe
sufficient to retain private counsel promptly. 2). Any income from receipt of child support
or need-based public assistance shall not be considered in determining
eligibility for publicly funded counsel. 3). Third-party resources. The resources of a
third party shall not be considered available to the person seeking publicly
funded counsel unless the third party expressly states a present intention to
pay for counsel, the person seeking counsel gives informed consent to this
arrangement, and the arrangement does not interfere with the person's
representation or jeopardize the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship. Neither the resources of a spouse nor the resources of a parent
of a person seeking publicly funded counsel shall be considered, except as
provided in this subdivision. (e) Process for determining eligibility. 1). Each judicial district shall establish a
process for determining eligibility in accordance with this rule and which
utilizes a screening tool promulgated and approved by the Chief Administrative

Judge. The court has the ultimate authority to determine eligibility but may
delegate the responsibility for screening and making an eligibility
recommendation to entities that are independent and conflict-free, including, but not limited to, entities providing representation. 2). The eligibility process, including the
documentation required to be submitted, shall not be unduly burdensome for the
person seeking publicly funded counsel. Counsel shall not be denied where the
person has made a good faith, but unsuccessful, effort to produce required
documentation or has made minor inadvertent or technical errors. Nor shall a
person be required to demonstrate an unsuccessful effort to retain private
counsel to be deemed financially eligible for publicly funded
counsel. 3). The court or delegated
screening entity shall preserve the confidentiality of the information
presented as part of the financial eligibility determination and shall take
steps to ensure that the screening and determination are done in a confidential
setting and that information identifying the person seeking counsel is not
accessible to the public or other parties, except as otherwise provided by the
court. (f) Reconsideration and review of a denial of publicly funded counsel or expenses. 1). A determination denying counsel by either
the court or delegated screening entity or a determination by the court denying
expenses under section
722-c
of the

County Law shall be in writing, shall include reasons for the denial and
procedure for seeking reconsideration, and shall be provided to the person
seeking counsel or expenses. 2). In
addition to a procedure for seeking prompt reconsideration from the court or
delegated screening entity, each judicial district shall establish a procedure
for prompt supervisory administrative review upon request by a person who has
been denied publicly funded counsel under section
722-b
of the

County Law or expenses under section
722-c
of the

County Law or for whom an order for payment under section
722-d
of the

County Law has been issued. These procedures shall be in writing, shall be
posted on the judiciary's public website and in each courthouse, and shall be
furnished to any person who has been denied publicly funded counsel or expenses
or who has been issued an order directing payment under sections
722-b, 722-c
or
722-d
of the

County Law, respectively. (g) Nothing in this rule shall impair or
prevent a party from seeking or obtaining an award of counsel fees and expenses
as a non-monied spouse, former spouse or parent for counsel of their choice
pursuant to section
438
of the

Family Court Act or section
237
of
the Domestic Relations Law, instead and in place of publicly funded counsel
pursuant to section
262

The rules shall apply also to any additional well which may be constructed on land owned by the village in the vicinity of the reservoir for the purpose of this public water supply. (b) [Interpretation.] Wherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a well is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the well. (c) Privies adjacent to any well. (1)

No privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any well forming the source of the public water supply of the Village of Fultonville.

(4)

Whenever the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers become filled within six inches of the top, said receptacles or containers shall be emptied or removed and the contents disposed of as hereinafter provided, in order to maintain the privy or receptacle in proper sanitary condition and effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy.

(2)

No human excreta and no compost or other matter containing human excreta shall be thrown, placed, piled or spread upon the surface of the ground, nor shall such human excreta, compost or other matter containing human excreta be buried in the soil unless covered with not less than 12 inches of soil nor within a distance of 500 feet of any well; and no manure or compost of any kind not containing human excreta shall be placed, piled or spread upon the ground within a distance of 100 feet of any well forming the source of the public water supply of the Village of Fultonville.

[Additional statutory authority: Public Housing Law, §156 ] The following exemptions are authorized: (a) Social security payments and income
received from private pension funds by any female 62 years of age or more, or
by any male 65 years of age or more, shall be excluded from annual income up to
a total maximum amount of $75 per month (Public Housing Law, §156). (b) A proportion of
income of adult members, other than chief wage earner, may be deducted from
annual income in an amount adopted by the authority and approved by the

Commissioner of Housing for the purpose of determining eligibility for
admission or continued occupancy, or for establishing rental of such family, or
for all such purposes (Public Housing Law, §156). The maximum amount
presently approved by the commissioner is $2,000 per secondary wage earner per
year per adult member, other than the chief wage earner, per year, but
authorities may establish a limit lower than this maximum. (c) The minor's income above $2,000 (or lower
limit that an authority may establish) is to be included in determining the
family's aggregate annual income solely for the purpose of establishing the
rent to be paid, in accordance with the authority's rent schedule. This income

State Regulations
(a) Application. The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law) as heretofore set forth shall apply to all the natural and artificial reservoirs and to all watercourses tributary thereto or ultimately discharging into any of said reservoirs that form the source or sources of the public water supply of the village of Keeseville, which is located partly in Clinton County and partly in Essex County, N. Y. (b) Definitions. (1)

The term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to Butternut Pond, the watershed of which lies wholly in Essex County and which serves as a source of public water supply of the village of Keeseville or to any additional reservoir which may be constructed or used for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)

The term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than the artificial reservoirs and filter basins), stream, ditch, gutter or other channel of every kind, the waters of which when running, whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into the public water supply of the village of Keeseville. (3)

Wherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)

No privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any reservoir or within 50 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Keeseville. (2)

No privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 150 feet of any reservoir or within 75 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Keeseville.

Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 491.23 - Investigations, immediate emergency measures and enforcement powers

State Regulations
(a) Investigations. (1)

The office
may undertake an investigation of the affairs and management of any shelter for
adults, small-capacity shelter, or shelters for adult families, or of any
person, corporation, society, association or organization that operates or
holds itself out as being authorized to operate any such facility, or of the
conduct of any officers or employers of any such facility. The office is
empowered to issue compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses and the
production of papers, to administer oaths and to examine persons under oath, and to exercise the same powers in respect to the conduct of such an
investigation as belong to referees appointed by the Supreme Court. (2)

If it shall appear after such
investigation that the residents of the facility are cruelly, negligently or
improperly treated, or that inadequate provision is made for their sustenance, clothing, care, supervision or other condition necessary for their comfort and
well-being, the office, may issue an order in the name of the people, and under
the official seal of the State, directing the appropriate officers or managers
of such facility to modify such treatment or provide such other remedy as may
be specified therein. Before any such order is issued, it must be approved by a

Justice of the Supreme Court, after such notice as he may prescribe and after
an opportunity to be heard, and any person to whom such an order is directed
who shall intentionally fail or refuse to obey its terms shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor. (b) Enforcement. (1)

Enforcement
shall mean the action(s) undertaken or initiated
by the office to help assure that shelters for adults, small-capacity shelters
and shelters for adult families are established and operated in compliance with
all applicable State and local laws or regulations, including the applicable
provisions of this Part, and in accordance with an operational plan approved by
the office. (2)

Enforcement actions
undertaken by the office may include, but are not limited to: (i) issuance of notice of intention to
initiate enforcement; (ii)
conduct
of hearings to determine if an operator has failed to comply with applicable
law and regulation; (iii)
determination, after hearing, that civil penalties should be imposed; (iv)
determination, after hearing, to revoke, suspend or limit an operating certificate; (v) issuance of an order pursuant to Social

Services Law section 460-d(2) requiring an operator to immediately remedy
conditions dangerous to residents; (vi)
temporary suspension or limitation of an
operating certificate upon finding that resident health and safety are in
imminent danger; (vii)
request to
the Attorney General to seek an injunction against an operator for violations
or threatened violations of law or regulation; or
(viii)
request to the Attorney General to
take such action as is necessary to seek criminal prosecution, or to bring
about compliance with any outstanding hearing determination or order. (3)

The operating certificate of
any shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter, or shelters for adult families
may be revoked, suspended or limited upon a determination by the office, after
a hearing in accordance with procedures set forth in Part 493 of this Title, that the operator has failed to comply with the operational plan approved by
the office or requirements of State or local laws or regulations applicable to
the operation of such facility. (4)

The operating certificate of any shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter, or
shelters for adult families may be temporarily suspended or limited without a
hearing for a period not in excess of 60 days upon written notice to the
facility that the office has found that the public health, or an individual's
health, safety or welfare is in imminent danger. If the office schedules an
expedited hearing to begin during the suspension period, in a proceeding to
suspend, revoke or limit the operating certificate, as set forth in section
493.8
of this Title, the temporary
suspension will remain in effect until the hearing decision is
issued. (5)

Any order or
determination to limit an operating certificate shall specify the manner in
which the operating certificate is to be limited. An operating certificate may
be found subject to one or more of the following limitations: (i) a limitation on the period of time for
which such certificate remains effective, contingent on a determination that
specified violations have been corrected or specified conditions have been
met; (ii)
a limitation on the
number of persons for which such facility is authorized to provide
care; (iii)
a prohibition against
the admission of new residents after a specified date; or
(iv)
a limitation on the type(s) of service
to be provided. (c) Violations or threatened violations of
law or State regulations at any shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter, or
shelters for adult families may be enjoined by the Supreme Court. The Attorney

General may seek such an injunction, in the name of the people, upon the
request of the office. Service in such an action shall state the nature of the
violation and shall be accomplished in the manner prescribed by the Civil

Practice Law and Rules; provided, however, that an
ex parte
temporary restraining order may be issued, notwithstanding the Civil Practice

Law and Rules, if the court finds, on motion and affidavit, that such violation
may reasonably be expected to result in imminent danger to the public health or
to the health, safety or welfare of any individual in a facility subject to the
office's inspection and supervision. The court, after a hearing, may issue a
preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction enjoining a facility from
admitting new residents, or directing the office and such facility to arrange
for the transfer of residents to other facilities, or any other injunctive
relief the court may deem necessary. (d) Whenever the office has knowledge, acquired by announced or unannounced inspections, audits, or other methods, or
has been advised by any State or local entity authorized to conduct inspections
or audits, that there exists a violation of law, regulation, or code with
respect to any shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter, or shelter for adult
families in which there are conditions that are dangerous, hazardous, imminently detrimental to life or health, or otherwise render the building not
fit for human habitation, the office may take immediate emergency measures, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: (1)
issuing an order directing the facility
to take immediate measures to rectify any deficiencies, violations, or
conditions, requiring additional security, or directing the transfer of the
facility's residents to other temporary emergency housing; or
(2)
temporarily suspending the facility's
operating certificate or directing closure of the facility, subject to the
notice and expedited hearing process set forth in section
493.8
of this Title. (e) If the office, after
investigation, finds that any person, agency or facility subject to this
regulation is causing, engaging in or maintaining a condition or activity which
constitutes a danger to the physical or mental health of the residents of a
facility subject to the inspection and supervision of the office, and that it, therefore, appears to be prejudicial to the interests of such residents to
delay action for 30 days until an opportunity for a hearing can be provided in
accordance with the provisions of this section, the office shall order the
person, agency or facility, by written notice setting forth the basis for such
finding, to discontinue such dangerous condition or activity or take certain
action immediately or within a specified period of less than 30 days. The
office shall, within 30 days of issuance of the order, provide the person, agency or facility an opportunity to be heard and to present any proof that
such condition or activity does not constitute a danger to the health of such
residents. Notes

The leak percentage
shall be determined by dividing the number of valves subject to the
requirements in subdivision (h) of this section for which leaks are detected by
the total number of valves subject to the requirements in subdivision (h) of
this section within the hazardous waste management unit. (m) Alternative standards
for valves in gas/vapor service or in light liquid service: skip period leak
detection and repair. (1)

An owner
or operator subject to the requirements of subdivision (h) of this section may
elect for all valves within a hazardous waste management unit to comply with

After two
consecutive quarterly leak detection periods with the percentage of valves
leaking equal to or less than two percent, an owner or operator may begin to
skip one of the quarterly leak detection periods (
i.e., monitor for leaks once every six months) for the valves subject to the
requirements in subdivision (h) of this section. (iii)

After five consecutive quarterly leak
detection periods with the percentage of valves leaking equal to or less than
two percent, an owner or operator may begin to skip three of the quarterly leak
detection periods (

Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in this

Part, the commissioner is authorized in hardship cases to make advance payments
in anticipation of the eligible person actually completing his or her moving of
personal property or actually purchasing or renting and occupying decent, safe

payment of the amount determined by him or her to represent reasonable and
necessary moving expenses or the amount of the approved supplemental relocation
payment deemed necessary to purchase or rent decent, safe and sanitary

can only be made if there is a signed contract for the purchase of a
replacement property, or in the case of a replacement rental unit, if there is
a signed lease or some other firm commitment. In both instances, the proposed
replacement housing must be inspected prior to payment for a determination of
compliance with decent, safe and sanitary standards. Notes

(a) Except as
otherwise provided in subdivision (i), (j) or (k) of this section, no
manufactured home may be installed in the State of New York at any time on or
after January 1, 2006 unless: (1)
the
manufacturer of such manufactured home shall have obtained a manufacturer's
warranty seal from the Department of State and shall have attached such
manufacturer's warranty seal to such manufactured home; and
(2)
the installer of such manufacturer home
shall have obtained an installer's warranty seal from the Department of State
and shall have attached such installer's warranty seal to such manufactured
home. The installer shall attach such installer's warranty seal after
installation is complete. (b) The manufacturer's warranty seal and
installer's warranty seal shall be attached in a permanent fashion in a
built-in closet in the master bedroom of such manufactured home. The seals
shall be attached at places within the closet where both seals can be readily
seen and read when the closet door is open. For the purposes of this
subdivision, if there is one bedroom in the manufactured home, such bedroom
shall be deemed to be the master bedroom; if there are two bedrooms in the
manufactured home, the larger bedroom shall be deemed to be the master bedroom; if there are three or more bedrooms in the manufactured home, the largest
bedroom shall be deemed to be the master bedroom; and if there are more than
one built-in closet in the master bedroom, manufacturer's warranty seal and
installer's warranty seal shall be attached in the larger (or largest) built-in
closet in the master bedroom. If there is no built-in closet in the master
bedroom, the manufacturer's warranty seal and installer's warranty seal shall
be attached in such other place or places as may be approved by the Department
of State in writing. (c) A
manufacturer may submit to the Department of State a request for five or more
manufacturer's warranty seals. An installer may submit to the Department of

permitted to submit any such request; and provided further that a person
holding an owner-occupant installer certificate issued pursuant to section
1210.6
(h) of this

Part shall be permitted to submit a request only for the installer's warranty
seal to be attached to the manufactured home which is identified in such
owner-occupant installer certificate. Any request for manufacturer's warranty
seals or for installer's warranty seal(s) shall be in writing, shall be on a
form provided by or otherwise acceptable to the Department of State, and shall
be accompanied by the applicable fee set forth in or determined pursuant to
section
1210.19
(Fees)
of
this Part. The requesting party must be certified by the Department of State as
a manufacturer or installer, as applicable. (d) A manufacturer attaching a manufacturer's
warranty seal to a manufactured home shall be deemed to warrant to the buyer of
such manufactured home: (1)
that the
manufacturer is approved to construct manufactured homes by the United States

Department of Housing and Urban Development; (2)
that such manufactured home was
constructed in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local
statutes, laws, codes, rules, and regulations; and
(3)
that the manufacturer is certified by the

Department of State (or, in the case of a seal affixed prior to July 1, 2006, that the manufacturer satisfies all applicable standards for certification as a
manufacturer and intends to obtain such certification). The warranties set forth in this subdivision shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of or substitution for, the warranty
provided for in article 35 of the General Business Law and any and all other
warranties, express or implied, given or made by the manufacturer, whether
contractually or by operation of law. (e) An installer attaching an installer's
warranty seal to a manufactured home will be deemed to warrant to the buyer of
such manufactured home: (1)
that the
installation of such manufactured home meets the standards of the Uniform Code; and
(2)
that the installer is
certified by the Department of State (or, in the case of a seal affixed prior
to July 1, 2006, that the installer satisfies all applicable standards for
certification as an installer and intends to obtain such certification). The warranties set forth in this subdivision shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of or substitution for, any and all other
warranties, express or implied, given or made by the installer, whether
contractually or by operation of law. The warranty of the installer that the
installation of such manufactured home meets the standards of the Uniform Code
shall be deemed to include, without limitation, a warranty that the foundation
or supports on which the manufactured home was installed were inspected and
approved by the governmental agency or department or other person or entity
responsible for enforcing the Uniform Code in the jurisdiction in which the
manufactured home was installed, and if such foundation or supports were
constructed by the installer, such warranty shall also be deemed to include, without limitation, a warranty that such foundation or supports were
constructed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Uniform

Code. (f) No
manufacturer shall charge a fee in excess of the fee set forth in section
1210.19
(Fees)
of
this Part for attaching a manufacturer's warranty seal to any manufactured
home. No installer shall charge a fee in excess of the fee set forth in section
1210.19
(Fees)
of
this Part for attaching an installer's warranty seal to any manufactured
home. (g) No governmental agency or
department or other person or entity responsible for issuing certificates of
occupancy in any jurisdiction shall issue a certificate of occupancy for any
manufactured home installed in such jurisdiction at any time on or after

January 1, 2006 unless: (1)
the manufacturer's
warranty seal required by this section has been attached to such manufactured
home (unless such manufacturer's warranty seal is not required by reason of
subdivision [i], [j] or [k] of this section); (2)
the installer's warranty seal required by
this section has been attached to such manufactured home; and
(3)
the governmental agency or department or
other person or entity responsible for issuing certificates of occupancy has
independently determined that such manufactured home has been installed in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Uniform Code. In determining whether such installation was or was not in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Uniform Code, the governmental
agency or department or other person or entity responsible for issuing
certificates of occupancy shall not rely upon the presence of the installer's
warranty seal, but shall make its own independent determination. (h) Neither the State of

New York nor the Department of State shall be deemed to make any warranty of
any kind, express or implied, to any manufacturer, retailer, installer, mechanic, homeowner, or lending entity, or to any buyer of any manufactured
home, to any governmental agency or department or other person or entity
responsible for issuing certificates of occupancy, or to any other person, entity, or business entity, by reason of the issuance by the Department of

State of any manufacturer's warranty seal or installer's warranty seal, or by
reason of any manufacturer's warranty seal or installer's warranty seal being
attached to or present on any manufactured home. No manufacturer, retailer, installer, or mechanic, and no person employed by or affiliated with any
manufacturer, retailer, installer, or mechanic, shall give or make any
statement or representation, written or oral, to any manufacturer, retailer, installer, mechanic, homeowner, or lending entity, to any buyer of any
manufactured home, to any governmental agency or department or other person or
entity responsible for issuing certificates of occupancy, or to any other
person, entity, or business entity, which indicates or which is intended to
indicate that any manufacturer's warranty seal or installer's warranty seal
constitutes, evidences, or gives rise to a warranty of any kind by the State of

New York or the Department of State. (i) A manufactured home which was installed
in the State of New York for a bona fide purchaser prior to January 1, 2006 and
which is re-installed (whether at its original site of installation or at a new
site) on or after January 1, 2006, may be so re-installed without attaching a
manufacturer's warranty seal. However, the installer performing such
re-installation must attach an installer's warranty seal at the time of such
re-installation. (j) A manufactured
home which was installed in the State of New York for a bona fide purchaser on
or after January 1, 2006, which bears the required manufacturer's warranty seal
and installer's warranty seal from the original installation, and which is
re-installed (whether at its original site of installation or at a new site) on
or after January 1, 2006, may be so re-installed without attaching an
additional manufacturer's warranty seal. However, the installer performing such
re-installation must attach an installer's warranty seal at the time of such
re-installation. (k) A manufactured
home which was manufactured prior to January 1, 2006 (as shown by the date of
manufacture on the HUD data plate affixed to such manufactured home) may be
installed or re-installed on or after January 1, 2006 without attaching a
manufacturer's warranty seal. However, the installer performing any such
installation or re-installation must attach an installer's warranty seal at the
time of such installation or re-installation. (l) The manufacturer shall type or print the
name of the manufacturer in the space provided on the manufacturer's warranty
seal, and the manufacturer or an authorized representative of the manufacturer

at the time of installation of the manufacturer's warranty seal. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, no statement, information, or other matter
shall be inserted in or otherwise added to a manufacturer's warranty seal, and
no statement, information, or other matter shall be crossed-out, obliterated, or otherwise removed from a manufacturer's warranty seal. A manufacturer's
warranty seal that does not comply with the requirements of this subdivision
shall not be deemed to be a valid manufacturer's warranty seal. (m) The installer shall check the appropriate
box (''new manufactured'' or ''relocated manufactured''), type or print the
appropriate information, and type or print the name of the installer and the
name of the authorized person signing the installer's warranty seal on behalf
of the installer in the spaces provided in the installer's warranty seal, and
the installer or an authorized representative of the installer shall sign the
installer's warranty seal in the space provided, prior to or at the time of

inserted in or otherwise added to an installer's warranty seal, and no
statement, information, or other matter shall be crossed-out, obliterated, or
otherwise removed from an installer' s warranty seal. An installer's warranty
seal that does not comply with the requirements of this subdivision shall not

maximum rent therefor, together with the dwelling space, essential services, furniture, furnishings and equipment required to be furnished with the
accommodations, unless such maximum rent had been previously fixed or
established by the State Rent Commission or by the administrator. (b) Where: (1)
no registration statement has been filed
under the Federal Act, or the State Rent Act, or the City Rent Law, as required
by these regulations; or
(2)
no
proper or timely registration statement has been filed as required by these

(5)
the administrator in a proceeding
pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section is unable to otherwise determine
the maximum rent; or
(6)
the
maximum rent must be fixed or established by the administrator; he may issue an order fixing or establishing the maximum
rent, having regard for the maximum rents for comparable housing accommodations
or any other factors bearing on the equities involved, consistent with the
purpose of the Rent Law, including but not limited to the factor that such
housing accommodations were created from housing accommodations which were
vacated, on or after November 22, 1963, other than by voluntary surrender of
possession or in the manner provided by Part 2204 of this Title. Where the
housing accommodations were created from such accommodations, the administrator
may give due consideration to the limitation on the amount of the rent
adjustment which may be ordered, pursuant to the provisions of section
2202.3
(a)(1)
of
this Part, in considering the equities involved. Such order shall fix or
establish the maximum rent as of May 1, 1950, or the date of first renting, whichever is later, and may contain a directive that all rent collected in
excess of the maximum rent fixed or established under this subdivision during
the period beginning no earlier than two years prior to the date of the filing
of the tenant's statement of violations, if any, or the date of the
commencement of the proceeding to fix or establish the maximum rent, whichever
date is earlier, shall be refunded to the tenant, together with six percent
interest from the date of each such excessive payment of rent, within 30 days
after such order shall become final. (c) Where the landlord has failed to file an
application or report required by the State Rent Commission or by either secton
2202.21(a) or (c) of this Part or section 35(a) or (c) of the New York City

Rent and Eviction Regulations, the administrator at any time, upon written
request of the tenant or on his own initiative, may issue an order establishing
the maximum rent by decreasing the previous maximum rent for the housing
accommodation by that amount which the administrator finds to be the reduction
in rental value of the housing accommodation because of the decrease in
dwelling space, essential services, furniture, furnishings or equipment. The
administrator may take into consideration all factors bearing on the equities
involved, consistent with the purposes of the Rent Law. Such order shall
establish the maximum rent as of the date of such decrease of dwelling space, essential services, furniture, furnishings or equipment, and may contain a
directive that all rent collected in excess of the maximum rent fixed or
established under this subdivision, during the period beginning no earlier than
two years prior to the date of the filing of the tenant's statement of
violations, if any, or the date of the commencement of the proceeding to fix or
establish the maximum rent, whichever date is earlier, shall be refunded to the
tenant, together with six percent interest from the date of each such excessive
